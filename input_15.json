All Nature carefully the law reveres , That gratitude and fealty endears.
That makes no difference , the lady cried.
-- What tithe ? cried he ; it surely has a name.
Not know ! astonishingly , replied the wife.
See if it looks more modern in my page.
Have loved her -- even though she were a wife.
THIS scene just ended , t ` other actor came , Whose prompt"
-LRB- I scarcely can proceed -RRB- To tie.
But you 'll be present , said the courteous knight.
And what of that ? rejoined the wily spouse.
Jack brought the couple presently to meet.
At this our arch gallant with laughter burst.
On board they had a man or two at most.
And each the best adventure hop 'd to boast.
.
The eight encircled him with great surprise ; No longer dumb.
These , however , were the two ministers.
In the white lily bloom , Brave boy , is thy tomb"
Then the King said , `` What God does , is well done !"
In the white lily bloom , Brave boy , is thy tomb"
In the white lily bloom , Bonny girl , is thy tomb"
In the meantime the children had grown up.
So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father.
`` Good day , mother ,"
said the boy.
`` Many thanks ,"
said she.
`` Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything"
`` And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father.
How wilt thou get over the water ?"
said the woman.
`` God knows"
`` Many thanks ,"
replied the old woman.
`` May God help you with your fishing ,"
said the maiden.
There the old woman was still standing.
When he was tired he took his flute , and made music.
`` Oh , no one"
`` To whom dost thou belong , then ?"
`` I am the fisherman 's son"
`` But he has no children"
`` If thou wilt not believe , come with me"
She had , however , grown quite ill and weak.
But the two false sisters were burnt , and the daughter married the prince"
Let me go out to-day , and you look after the house by yourself"
`` Yes , yes ,"
`` Well , here you are again ,"
said the mouse , `` no doubt you have had a merry day"
`` All went off well ,"
answered the cat.
`` What name did they give the child ?"
`` Top off !"
said the cat quite coolly.
`` Top off !"
`` What does it signify ,"
Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing.
`` Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself ,"
said she , and was quite satisfied with her day 's work.
`` Half-done ,"
answered the cat.
The cat 's mouth soon began to water for some more licking.
`` All good things go in threes ,"
said she , `` I am asked to stand godmother again.
`` Top-off ! Half-done !"
`` You sit at home ,"
`` When everything is eaten up one has some peace ,"
`` It will not please you more than the others ,"
said the cat.
`` He is called All-gone"
`` All-gone ,"
All-gone ; what can that mean ?"
`` Yes ,"
`` Alas !"
First top off , then half done , then --"
`` Will you hold your tongue ,"
cried the cat , `` one word more and I will eat you too"
`` All gone"
Verily , that is the way of the world"
`` Oh ,"
`` Oh , yes ,"
`` Now I have a white horse , and I will travel ,"
said he.
`` Oh , to the next place"
Then what his name was ? `` Ferdinand the Faithful"
And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place.
`` Oh , I am just traveling round about ,"
said he.
`` Oh ,"
said the girl , `` I will help thee too"
Ferdinand the Unfaithful was , however , always hostile to Ferdinand the Faithful.
And Ferdinand the Faithful went in , and fetched them.
`` Yes ,"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said he.
Then the King was buried , but she married Ferdinand the Faithful.
The maiden replied , `` I know not where thy house is"
`` Can you not tell me ,"
said the maiden , `` if my betrothed lives here ?"
`` Alas , poor child ,"
`` Be as still as a mouse ,"
Hardly was this done , than the godless crew came home.
They dragged with them another young girl.
Then the robbers said , `` The old woman is right ,"
But God helped her , and she got safely over.
As they sat at table , each was bidden to relate something.
The bride sat still , and said nothing.
She replied , `` Then I will relate a dream.
And this it cried once more.
` My darling , I only dreamt this.
' My darling , I only dreamt this.
My darling , I only dreamt this.
My darling , I only dreamt this.
And there is the finger with the ring !"
Then he and his whole troop were executed for their infamous deeds"
`` Just show me for once in a way what you can do ,"
said the host.
`` If you can do that ,"
said the innkeeper , `` you have learned everything"
`` Be easy ,"
Which hand was it ?"
`` The right one"
said he.
`` Yes ,"
said the girl.
`` That 's well ,"
Then they paid their bill , and traveled farther.
Will one of you lead me , so that I do not fall"
`` Eh ,"
The two sat up , but could see nothing.
We must return to the innkeeper , he has deceived us"
And a crane thought on seeing the fish.
`` I am sitting thinking about you ,"
said he.
`` Oh , sir ! what are you thinking about us ?"
said they.
`` Why ,"
said they.
answered the crane.
And he told them all the glories of the pond.
Come along.
I 'll take you too !"
`` But how will you take hold of me to carry me along ?"
`` I 'll bite hold of you with my beak"
`` You 'll let me fall if you carry me like that.
I wo n't go with you !"
`` Uncle !"
`` Oh , that 's it , is it ?"
answered the crane.
`` Ah ! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity ,"
Grant me my life !"
`` Father , I have learned what the dogs say when they bark"
`` Lord have mercy on us !"
He answered , `` Father , I have learned what the birds say"
`` Yes ,"
`` Ah , dear little master ,"
I am afraid the strings would not last"
No excuses were of any use.
The donkey said , `` Here we will stay ,"
`` Then let the musician come to me ,"
said the King.
`` No ,"
said he , `` I will sit by the King"
`` Well , then , thou shalt sit next her too ,"
said the King.
`` That is exactly what I wish ,"
Dost thou want gold ?"
`` No ,"
said the donkey , and shook his head.
`` Dost thou want jewels and rich dress ?"
`` No"
`` Dost thou wish for half my kingdom ?"
`` Indeed , no"
Wilt thou have my pretty daughter to wife ?"
`` Ah , yes ,"
said the ass , `` I should indeed like her ,"
So a great and splendid wedding was held.
`` Now ,"
Soon came the old King , `` Ah ,"
The King said , `` That can not be true"
`` Thy advice is good ,"
said the youth.
The dog replied , `` I am hungry , and have nothing to eat"
`` Yes , I have had meat enough ,"
he answered , `` but I have had no bread yet"
Said the sparrow , `` Thou shalt have that also , come with me"
`` Yes ,"
he replied , `` now we will walk awhile outside the town"
Then they both went out on to the highway.
`` Well , do sleep ,"
So the dog lay down on the road , and fell fast asleep.
`` Cart and horses indeed !"
said the waggoner.
`` What harm canst thou do me ?"
and drove onwards.
`` Unfortunate fellow that I am ,"
cried he.
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
`` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am ,"
cried he.
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
but the sparrow replied , `` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
`` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am"
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
`` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am ,"
cried he.
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
answered the sparrow.
`` Now will I make thee unfortunate in thy home ,"
and flew away.
`` Ah ,"
`` Alas , husband ,"
`` Not unfortunate enough yet !"
and flew out.
At length , however , he caught it with his hand.
Then his wife said , `` Shall I kill it ?"
`` No ,"
cried he , `` that would be too merciful.
It shall die much more cruelly ,"
and he took it and swallowed it whole.
But the sparrow flew up and away"
`` Yes ,"
`` Oh ,"
said the father , `` she 's sharp enough ;"
`` Well ,"
`` Elsie , why weepest thou ?"
asked the maid.
`` Ah ,"
Then said the maid , `` What a clever Elsie we have !"
and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.
Then he asked , `` Why are ye weeping ?"
`` Ah ,"
Then said the boy , `` What a clever Elsie we have !"
and sat down by her , and likewise began to howl loudly.
Then said the mother likewise , `` What a clever Elsie we have !"
and sat down and wept with them.
and sat down , and likewise wept with them.
`` What misfortune has happened then ?"
he asked.
`` Ah , dear Hans ,"
`` Come ,"
`` Yes , dear Hans , I will do that"
Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.
`` Yes ,"
answered Hans , `` she is within"
When I am King , I will return and fetch thee"
and thereupon the King shut his eyes , and died.
`` Yes ,"
said the King , `` they are twelve huntsmen"
The lion continued , `` Thou art mistaken , they are twelve girls"
`` Oh , just let some peas be strewn in thy ante-chamber ,"
answered the lion , `` and then thou wilt soon see it.
The King , however , would no longer believe the lion.
The lad did so , and set out.
and went away.
Seame said , `` Hogs ' bristles ,"
At length they believed him , and led him to the King.
`` Oh !"
said the father to that , and turned his back.
replied the old man in a spiteful voice.
The boy , however , was tremendously delighted and jumped for joy.
said the father again.
`` Then ,"
said the little man , `` so shall they be , and remain"
He worked diligently , and whistled all the time.
The iron man said , `` So it shall be , and remain"
On the third day Stupid Hans went.
`` Well ,"
He got into it and rowed to the palace.
The boat went as swiftly as the wind.
`` Good ,"
Hans set out at once , and walked straight forwards.
`` Yes , indeed ,"
said Hans , `` I will do that"
The man asked Hans whither he was journeying ? `` To the Griffin ,"
said Hans.
`` Then when you get to him ,"
`` Yes , indeed , most certainly I 'll do that ,"
said Hans.
Hans was quite satisfied with this , and got under the bed.
`` Yes ,"
and on that the Griffin said no more.
`` Oh ! the fools !"
`` Oh ! the fools !"
`` Oh , the fool !"
Early the next morning the Griffin got up and went out.
Hans , however , married the daughter , and became King"
thought she , and went up to the light.
She knocked , and a rough voice from inside cried , `` Come in"
`` Just come in ,"
`` Duks ,"
`` It is not my fault ,"
`` I will take a bag with lentils ,"
The animals again replied `` Duks ,"
and everything happened just as it had happened the day before.
`` Have no fear ,"
They are still larger than lentils , and will show her the way"
`` Duks ,"
said they.
`` I hope you will like it , dear animals ,"
Then said the girl , `` Ought we not to go to bed ?"
The animals answered `` Duks ,"
`` But where are my two sisters ?"
inquired the maiden.
`` If you are thirsty ,"
Then she said , `` Ah , Heaven !"
for she had long ago forgotten the girl 's ill words.
and the princess had to be content with that.
But Falada saw all this , and observed it well.
He answered , `` I will do so most willingly"
`` Why not ?"
inquired the aged King.
`` Oh , because she vexes me the whole day long"
and he went away.
If my mother did but know that , her heart would break"
`` It is thou ,"
and then it will vanish again from thy sight"
Hereupon the wise woman departed.
and helped herself to some food , and enjoyed it.
and immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again.
`` That is a delightful way of keeping house !"
thought Two-eyes , and was quite glad and happy.
and in an instant all was gone.
Come , let us go home again"
and Three-eyes had seen everything.
and all disappears.
I watched everything closely.
`` Have I not reason to weep ?"
she answered.
One-eye slipped down , and Three-eyes climbed up.
`` Quick , Two-eyes ,"
They again asserted that the tree was their property.
`` Yes ,"
`` Alas !"
`` The wonderful tree , however , still remains with us ,"
Who knows what good things may be in store for us ?"
Two-eyes lived a long time in happiness.
`` Yonder lies some more of the same sort ,"
`` Yes ,"
It would be a sin to tear the book up entirely.
`` Is it true ,"
he asked , `` that you do n't know what poetry means ?"
`` Of course I know it ,"
`` Now I shall tell it to the student !"
`` This is an incomparable place ,"
`` I must divide myself between the two ,"
Now , that was spoken quite like a human creature.
We all of us visit the huckster for the sake of the porridge"
The servant stood by and listened.
`` Yes ,"
`` Out with you , you idle , good-for-nothing creatures !"
`` Ah ,"
`` Dear father ,"
`` Nay , my son ,"
`` Just go to the neighbor ,"
`` Oh , you fool ,"
Then all at once it seemed to him that he heard a voice.
Then he cried , `` Where art thou ?"
Let me out ! Let me out !"
`` Let me out ! Let me out !"
`` Knowest thou ,"
`` No ,"
replied the scholar fearlessly , `` how should I know that ?"
`` Then I will tell thee ,"
cried the spirit ; `` I must strangle thee for it"
`` Thou shouldst have told me that sooner ,"
`` More persons here , more persons there ,"
said the spirit.
`` Thou shalt have the wages thou hast earned.
No , it was a punishment for me.
I am the mighty Mercurius.
Whoso releases me , him must I strangle"
`` Softly ,"
answered the scholar , `` not so fast.
The spirit said haughtily , `` that is a very trifling feat ,"
`` No ,"
`` If thou wilt set me free ,"
`` No ,"
`` Thou art playing away with thy own good luck ,"
`` Now thou shalt have thy reward ,"
`` I must just try that ,"
It immediately closed together and was healed.
`` Now , it is all right ,"
he said to the spirit , `` and we can part"
`` Where hast thou been racing about ?"
`` Be easy , father , I will make it up"
`` Make it up indeed ,"
said the father angrily , `` there 's no art in that"
`` Do n't get angry ,"
said the son , `` I will soon pay for the axe"
`` Oh , thou blockhead ,"
`` Eh , what !"
Do go with me"
`` I know that already ,"
answered the old man , `` one thaler , six groschen"
`` Good heavens !"
said the father , `` how hast thou come by these riches ?"
There he passed many years , and no one could deliver him.
She , however , made nothing of it.
She thought , `` Ah , whither have I come ,"
Then she took courage , and knocked at the door.
and a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her.
Then the little one went and brought the box.
If she did all this she would get her lover back again.
Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages.
`` If thou art willing so am I ,"
said he.
A mouse did run , This story is done"
If a beggar came , I turned away my eyes from him.
`` I know ,"
My children are starving , lend me four measures \* of corn"
`` I will not lend thee four measures ,"
`` What am I to do ?"
said the poor man.
`` What are you looking for here ?"
the peasant asked.
`` Are you not afraid of the lonely churchyard ?"
`` I am looking for nothing ,"
`` If you are without fear ,"
`` To keep watch is a soldier 's business ,"
`` Be off , you ragamuffins !"
`` Sir with the red feather ,"
Go away , we shall stay sitting here"
`` I have not so much as that about me ,"
said the Devil , `` but I will fetch it.
`` That will do ,"
said he ; `` now the chimney-sweep may come"
`` Just pour it in ,"
`` Stupid Devil ,"
`` Now pour it in ,"
cried the soldier , `` but I doubt the boot wo n't be full"
The gold clinked as it fell , but the boot remained empty.
`` You have shamefully big calves to your legs !"
cried he , and made a wry face.
`` Did you think ,"
The Wicked One went off again.
The poor soul was saved.
`` Stupid thing ,"
`` Wait ,"
He called them all sluggards.
`` There , they are using that red sand-stone again that never dries !"
cried he.
He stumbled on the carpenters.
`` What 's this ?"
`` Well , what 's that again ?"
`` Master ,"
An angel from heaven , however , would never make you believe that"
When he got there , he knocked loudly at the door.
`` I wonder ,"
`` Ah , it 's you , Master Pfriem ;"
`` You might have spared your warning ,"
answered Pfriem.
Then he saw two angels who were carrying away a beam.
`` Did any one ever see such a piece of stupidity ?"
They were watering the earth with rain.
`` Hang it ,"
`` It 's no wonder ,"
`` Good wishes ,"
In fact an angel did come and harnessed two horses to it.
`` That 's quite right ,"
That was too much for Master Pfriem , `` Clumsy creature ,"
At this moment Master Pfriem awoke.
`` Things are certainly arranged in heaven otherwise than they are on earth ,"
`` Yes , my good fellow ,"
`` Why should I be sad ?"
`` How much is your treasure ?"
the dwarf asked him.
`` How much ? Three farthings sterling , all told"
`` Look here ,"
`` Aha ?"
`` All that shall you have ,"
`` Heart alive ! What can one desire more ?"
said the servant to himself , and went merrily onwards.
`` Good heavens ,"
`` If that is all ,"
said the servant , `` the bird shall soon be down here ;"
`` Go , you rogue ,"
`` Oh !"
`` Oh dear ,"
`` If you are so liberal ,"
and having taken the purse he went his way.
and went on abusing him as fast as he could speak.
`` My lord judge ,"
`` Was it a soldier ,"
said the judge , `` who cut you thus with his sabre ?"
`` Nothing of the sort !"
`` Heaven defend us !"
`` Yes , if you do not ask your life ,"
said the judge.
`` I do not ask for life ,"
`` I stole it , I stole it !"
cried he ; `` but you have honestly earned it"
But the Phoenix is not the bird of Arabia alone.
Hear what the Moon told me.
There he stood.
`` At that moment the mother awoke.
` Why , that is Bertel , ' said he.
`` Years have passed since all this happened ,"
the Moon went on to say.
He had blue eyes and long white hair.
What will the next thing be ? It is wonderful !"
`` Yes , certainly ,"
said the Inkstand.
`` It 's extraordinary -- that 's what I always say ,"
It 's quite incredible.
`` There you are right ,"
It is the pen that writes.
`` You have but little experience ,"
replied the Inkstand.
I know the quill as well as the steel pen.
`` Inkpot !"
exclaimed the Pen.
Late in the evening the poet came home.
Yes , that is what the poet wrote down.
`` That is what you get , madam ,"
said the Pen to the Inkstand , when the two were alone again.
`` Did you not hear him read aloud what I have written down ?"
`` Yes , what I gave you to write ,"
retorted the Inkstand.
`` That was a cut at you , because of your conceit.
`` Ink-pipkin !"
cried the Pen.
`` Writing-stick !"
cried the Inkstand.
But the poet did not sleep.
To _ Him _ be all the honor !"
A soldier who is afraid of nothing , troubles himself about nothing.
`` I see thou hast good boots on , which are well blacked ,"
`` I do n't know that myself ,"
answered the huntsman , `` I have lost my way in the forest"
`` Then thou art in the same plight as I ,"
`` We do not get out of the forest ,"
`` We are looking for quarters for the night ,"
`` You can not stay here ,"
`` It wo n't be so bad as that ,"
I shall go in"
`` Thou wilt bring us to destruction ,"
said the huntsman , and held him back by the arm.
But the soldier began to cough loudly.
`` Aha , gentlemen , are you in the corner ?"
`` But do be civil ,"
`` We shall see ,"
`` Brother Brightboots , come and eat ,"
but the huntsman would not eat.
and then he drank a hearty draught.
Come , eat and drink"
`` Brother Bright-boots ,"
Then he saw that the entire body-guard was coming up.
`` What can this mean ?"
said he to the huntsman.
`` Dost thou not know ?"
`` But where is the King ?"
said the soldier , `` I do not see him"
`` Here he is ,"
Then he opened his hunting-coat , and his royal garments were visible.
But if thou wouldst drink a health , thou must first ask my permission"
He did not die , however , but remained lying there.
said she.
`` Dear father ,"
he said , `` do bring me bagpipes"
The King said , `` Yes ,"
and wrote a promise to Hans the Hedgehog that he should have this.
When he got to the courtyard , there were great rejoicings.
She asked him where in the world he had been so long.
Hans the Hedgehog rode away to the first kingdom.
`` That is the reward of your falseness ,"
said he , `` go your way , I will not have you !"
The boy called , `` Thief ! thief ! rascal !"
with all the strength of his body.
But he was very much mistaken.
These also the boy had to take to him with a letter.
`` Ah ,"
`` I will soon show thee the difference ,"
The next day he set him a hard task.
`` Ah ,"
Rather than that I will take my own life"
`` I do not know ,"
He seated himself in a little chair , and was prepared to die.
`` It can not have been poison ,"
It was , however , no poison for flies , but Hungarian wine.
The boy got out the bottle , and emptied it.
`` This death tastes sweet too ,"
`` I feel that I must die ,"
He lost his senses more and more.
He sought a way out , but could find none.
`` Good woman ,"
`` Oh , yes , Lord King ,"
`` What kind of condition is it ?"
asked the King.
`` I have a daughter ,"
`` Where are thy brothers ?"
asked the King.
`` Alas , dear father ,"
she answered , `` they have gone away and left me alone !"
The poor girl thought , `` I can no longer stay here.
I will go and seek my brothers"
`` Here canst thou not abide ,"
they said to her.
`` But can you not protect me ?"
asked the little sister.
`` No ,"
`` Alas , no ,"
Next morning she went out and gathered starwort and began to sew.
They called to her and said , `` Who art thou ?"
But she made no answer.
`` Come down to us ,"
said they.
`` We will not do thee any harm"
She only shook her head.
But she did not answer.
And after some days he united himself to her.
`` Who knows ,"
Then the stone image of St.
Then the great stone image of St.
Christopher than the two first had been.
Then the great tall stone image of St.
`` No ,"
Then the youngest was forced to go and take him something to eat.
said he , `` I am getting on very badly"
Then she said he was to come and just eat a little.
`` Nay ,"
On this they all disappeared.
`` Yes ,"
said the King 's son.
said the King.
Then he was much troubled.
`` My tools have broken to pieces again"
`` Oh ,"
`` No ,"
Then they all went away.
When the King 's son awoke the fish-pond was done.
`` Yes ,"
said the King 's son.
That was very good.
`` What is that , then ?"
asked the King 's son.
When it was mid-day she came and brought him something to eat.
on which they all disappeared.
When it had struck six , they went home together.
Then said the King , `` Is the castle ready ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the King 's son.
`` Oh ,"
So he listened to the sermon , and then went home again.
`` Thou shouldst just have brought the priest ,"
said his wife , `` and then the church would soon have come.
It is no use to send thee , I must go there myself"
She wanted to catch the fish , but she could not.
and said that now they might come back to her.
So the young folks went once more away together.
When the bride came , they were at once to be married.
So the miller said , `` Yes , do go there"
So the bride said , `` Yes , she was willing to do that"
But the false mother and the bride had to depart.
And the mouth of the person who last told all this is still warm"
`` Ah ,"
She answered , `` I have just eaten , and am still satisfied ,"
for she thought the angels were there.
until he did it.
The King replied , `` Yes , I would like to see her"
`` Little worm ,"
`` What dost thou want with it ?"
said the King 's son.
`` I do not want the apple for myself ,"
I have traveled far about the world and can not find the tree"
`` I will soon find it ,"
`` They will be sure to let me in ,"
said the King 's son.
`` That luck will be mine ,"
said the King 's son.
`` Where the apple is , the ring must be also ,"
We will bathe in the river , and cool ourselves before we begin again"
`` What shall I do ?"
said the King 's son.
Thy life they dare not take"
`` Wait , you fellow behind the stove , I am coming ,"
said another.
The next night the devils came and began their gambols anew.
The hob-goblins came again : `` Art thou there still ?"
cried they , `` thou shalt be tormented till thy breath stops"
`` Rise ,"
`` What am I to do ,"
asked he.
`` No ,"
said the man , `` I will not eat or drink"
Then he let himself be persuaded , and drank.
When she came to him , there he was lying fast asleep.
At length he ventured it and went in.
`` I 'd rather you would leave that alone ,"
`` If that be true ,"
`` This pleases me well ,"
said the giant , and ate to his heart 's content.
`` It 's no matter !"
But there , too , it was in vain.
`` How am I to get there ?"
asked the man.
So he again cried , `` God be with ye !"
Then he cried for the third time , `` God be with ye ,"
and thought , `` I must see what these three are about ,"
and went thither and asked why they were beating each other so furiously.
`` Very well ,"
said the father , `` I am quite content with that ,"
and gave him some money for his journey.
So he traveled about and looked for work.
said the huntsman , `` if thou wilt go with me"
`` Well , really ,"
and helped himself to another.
`` I have not snatched it away ,"
said the other , `` a sharpshooter must have shot it away from thee"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` I will soon get her for you"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` that will be a little bit of fun for me"
He said , `` No ,"
she must first pay for the things she had already had.
Thou art poor , and hast no money"
He asked her if she were the King 's daughter.
`` Yes ,"
answered she.
`` With this sword ,"
said he , `` did I cut off the heads of three giants"
And he took their tongues out of his knapsack in proof.
The captain said , `` Then they can not have had any"
`` Not so ,"
said the King.
`` Every animal has a tongue ,"
`` Eh ! what ?"
said the man.
`` You are not very sharp.
If he has served us , he has had good feeding for it"
`` Hark ye , gossip ,"
I have thought of something.
Henceforth Old Sultan was as well off as he could wish to be.
`` But , gossip ,"
`` Do not reckon upon that ,"
`` Thou hast misled me finely ,"
The fox replied , `` Why art thou such a glutton ?"
`` There is something for thee to eat ,"
said he to him , and then went his way.
`` How abominably thou hast misled me !"
But the fox replied , `` Why art thou such a glutton ?"
`` I am willing ,"
`` I must see that no one is coming ,"
replied the crafty fellow.
`` Do n't eat too much !"
`` You can learn that here quite well ,"
says the woman , `` my son is a master of it"
`` Oh ,"
`` Hollo , my son , art thou here ?"
`` Father , let us go ,"
said the youth.
Then the father and son set out homeward.
On the way a carriage comes driving by.
`` Yes ,"
says the father.
`` How much do you want for it ?"
`` Thirty thalers"
They go home together.
There were once two brothers , the one rich , the other poor.
and the mountain opened to him also.
and the mountain closed itself , and he went home with his barrow.
`` Corn and barley ,"
said the other.
The poor man then told him everything , just as it happened.
The mountain opened , and he went inside it.
Peter , and asked him to give them shelter for the night.
Thereupon person_0.
`` Oh ,"
said he , `` do you want to win the three groschen too ?"
On this they would not let him go.
So he went in , and played away the three groschen also.
Meanwhile person_0.
person_0.
Peter.
Upon this person_0.
We must send Death to him"
So person_0.
People no longer die ; we must go ourselves"
and Death took him directly and put an end to him.
`` Who is there ?"
`` Gambling Hansel"
`` Ah , we will have nothing to do with him ! Begone !"
So he went to the door of Purgatory , and knocked once more.
`` Who is there ?"
`` Gambling Hansel"
`` Ah , there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him.
We do not want to gamble , just go away again"
So again person_0.
And they let him in.
Therefore person_0.
`` Never ,"
`` Oh ,"
`` If that 's the case ,"
`` What art thou doing there ?"
asked the person_0 's son.
`` I am listening ,"
replied the man.
`` What art thou listening to so attentively ?"
`` Tell me ,"
`` Why ,"
said the prince , `` what a tall rascal thou art !"
`` Oh ,"
I will gladly enter your service , if you will take me"
`` Come with me ,"
said the prince , `` I can make use of thee"
`` No ,"
If you can use that , I shall be glad to serve you"
`` Come with me ,"
replied the person_0 's son , `` I can make use of thee"
`` How canst thou shiver when the sun is shining so warm ?"
said the person_0 's son.
`` Alack ,"
replied the man , `` I am of quite a different nature.
`` Thou art a strange fellow ,"
`` What art thou looking at so eagerly ?"
said the person_0 's son.
`` What is the first to be ?"
A ring is to be got out of the Red Sea.
Come , find some way of doing it"
`` Oh , is that all !"
`` May I invite no guests to this repast ?"
inquired the prince , `` no dinner is good without some company"
`` Oh , misery and misfortune !"
cried the prince , `` now I am lost !"
`` Yes ,"
`` What shall we do ?"
said he to the Stout One.
We two shall have to set to work also , and help him"
`` Yes ,"
This brave warrior was always followed by a band of faithful knights.
In this band there were five knights of great valor.
`` No , I do not think that you are telling a lie ,"
said Hojo.
`` I will take this ,"
and he mounted his horse and rode off gallantly.
`` It is just as I thought ,"
Then his helmet was seized from the back.
`` Who are you ?"
said Watanabe fearlessly.
The ogre thought to terrify his foe , but Watanabe never flinched.
As he did so he stumbled upon something lying on the ground.
He ordered the servant to show her in.
`` I was very disappointed ,"
`` I am very proud to think ,"
There is nothing that can be compared to your courage.
she added pleadingly.
`` No ,"
`` But why ?"
asked the old woman.
`` Because ,"
`` Your precaution is very reasonable ,"
said the old woman.
answered Watanabe.
`` Then you can not surely refuse to show me the arm any longer"
Come , follow me !"
said the old nurse , with a joyful face.
So quick was Watanabe that the creature had a narrow escape.
In this way the ogre escaped with his arm.
He waited in patience for another opportunity to dispatch the ogre.
The baking-oven sticks out of the wall like a little fat body.
There is a yard-dog too , who barks at all comers.
said the wife.
Ride to the fair"
Yes , the old man knew what he was about.
There was no shelter anywhere from the sunbeams.
The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow can be.
`` She gives good milk , I 'm sure ,"
said the peasant.
`` Hallo , you there with the cow !"
If you like , we 'll exchange"
`` To be sure I will ,"
said the man ; and they exchanged accordingly.
`` I should like to have that fellow ,"
said our peasant to himself.
Shall we exchange ?"
So our peasant went on in the high-road with his sheep.
`` That 's a heavy thing you have there.
By this time he was very near the town.
`` Cluck , cluck !"
said the fowl.
On my word , I should like to have that fowl.
`` Shall we exchange ?"
he asked the toll-taker.
`` Exchange !"
repeated the man ; `` well , that would not be a bad thing"
The hostler was carrying a sack.
`` What have you in that sack ?"
asked the peasant.
`` Rotten apples ,"
-LRB- Illustration : THE OLD MAN RELATES HIS SUCCESS.
Yes , I shall be glad to show them to her"
`` What will you give me for the sackful ?"
asked the hostler.
`` What will I give ? I will give my fowl in exchange"
But the stove was hot : he had not thought of that.
`` Why , do you know -- ,"
said our peasant.
said one of the two Englishmen.
`` There will be a disturbance"
`` What ? -- give me what ?"
said the peasant.
'"
`` Shall we wager ?"
said the Englishman.
`` A bushel will be enough ,"
replied the peasant.
`` Done -- taken !"
And the bet was made.
`` Good evening , old woman"
`` Good evening , old man"
`` I 've made the exchange"
`` Yes , you understand what you 're about ,"
said the woman.
`` I got a cow in exchange for the horse ,"
said he.
`` Heaven be thanked !"
said she.
`` Yes , but I changed the cow for a sheep"
`` Ah , that 's better still !"
cried the wife.
How you think of everything !"
`` But I changed away the sheep for a goose"
You are always thinking of something to give me pleasure.
`` But I gave away the goose for a fowl ,"
said the man.
`` A fowl ? That was a good exchange !"
replied the woman.
`` Yes , but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shrivelled apples"
`` What ! -- I must positively kiss you for that ,"
exclaimed the wife.
I thought it should be pancakes with savoury herbs.
I had eggs , and bacon too ; but I wanted herbs.
I begged her to lend me a handful of herbs.
That I 'm very glad of ; that makes me laugh !"
And with that she gave him a sounding kiss.
`` I like that !"
exclaimed both the Englishmen together.
`` Always going down-hill , and always merry ; that 's worth the money"
You see , that is my story.
The eldest said , `` I will manage to find it ,"
`` No ,"
said the King , `` the danger of it is too great.
I would rather die"
But he begged so long that the King consented.
`` Silly shrimp ,"
and rode on.
The sick King waited long for him , but he came not.
said the prince , `` that is nothing to thee ,"
and rode on without giving him another look.
So fare haughty people.
`` Dost thou know , then , where that is to be found ?"
`` No ,"
said the prince.
When he arrived , everything was as the dwarf had said.
So he lay down and fell asleep.
When he awoke , it was striking a quarter to twelve.
`` They are imprisoned between two mountains ,"
said the dwarf.
`` I have condemned them to stay there , because they were so haughty"
`` Alas !"
The old King then thought , `` Can my son have been innocent ?"
`` He still lives ,"
and told the King how it had happened.
`` Dear Hans ,"
The father was sitting in the doorway.
`` God save us !"
`` Do n't grow any gray hairs about that , dear father ,"
`` Hollo !"
cried Hans , `` what art thou doing up there ?"
`` That is what I like ,"
thought Hans , `` he has some strength ,"
`` Thy name is now Fir-twister ,"
said Hans to him.
`` Oh , indeed ,"
thought Hans , `` I can make use of this one also ;"
The next morning Hans went into the garden.
`` Be off , sly hypocrite ,"
he answered , `` thou needest no meat"
and the mere thought of that gave him pleasure already.
and handed him a bit.
But the dwarf begged again for the third time.
`` Thou art shameless !"
said Hans , and gave him none.
Hans now went home , but he had marked the spot.
`` It is indeed sad ,"
Beware of opening it , or thou wilt bring misery on thyself"
`` Oh no ,"
said the little angels , `` that would be a sin.
The Virgin Mary has forbidden it , and it might easily cause thy unhappiness"
If I do it , no one will ever know"
Immediately a great fear fell on her.
She shut the door violently , and ran away.
`` No ,"
she replied.
`` Yes ,"
said the girl , for the second time.
`` No ,"
said the girl for the third time.
Into this she crept when night came , and here she slept.
But she gave no answer , for she could not open her mouth.
The King continued , `` Wilt thou go with me to my castle ?"
Then she just nodded her head a little.
She must be judged ,"
and the King was no longer able to restrain his councillors.
`` Perhaps some accident has befallen him ,"
The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest.
The boy ran thither and said , `` Give me my ball out"
`` Not till thou hast opened the door for me ,"
answered the man.
`` No ,"
and ran away.
but the boy would not.
The door opened with difficulty , and the boy pinched his fingers.
She called the boy , but no one answered.
If thou dost all I bid thee , thou shalt fare well.
I will come every evening to see if thou hast obeyed my order"
`` Nothing , nothing ,"
By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it.
He took it quickly out , but it was already quite gilded.
Iron John came , and already knew what had happened.
`` Thou hast let a hair fall into the well ,"
said he.
`` Oh , no ,"
He again said , `` I may not , I have a sore head"
Not long afterwards , the country was overrun by war.
When he came to the outskirts , he called `` Iron John ,"
three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees.
`` I want a strong steed , for I am going to the wars"
`` That thou shalt have , and still more than thou askest for"
`` What dost thou desire ?"
asked the wild man.
`` I am not the one who carried away the victory ,"
And then he was still more ridiculed"
Perhaps the unknown will come to it"
`` What dost thou desire ?"
asked he.
`` That I may catch the King 's daughter 's golden apple"
`` It is as safe as if thou hadst it already ,"
said Iron John.
They rode back and announced this to the King.
asked the King.
`` Yes ,"
answered he , `` and here the apples are ,"
`` I well see ,"
`` Yes ,"
answered he , `` that indeed you can.
Give me your daughter to wife"
and then she went and kissed him.
`` That 's right , my son ,"
Then he said , `` Mother , what is there to eat to-day ?"
`` See for thyself ,"
said his mother.
`` Mistress , if you give us no better food ,"
Potato-King.
'"
`` What wouldst thou have forsooth , grasshopper ?"
`` Ho , ho , lady mistress ,"
`` Hollo ,"
Thumbling reflected a while , and at length he said , `` yes ,"
and went with them to the treasure-chamber.
`` Let the poor creature alone ,"
said the other ; `` it has done thee no harm"
The robbers paid him great compliments.
`` Thou art a valiant hero ,"
said they ; `` wilt thou be our captain ?"
Then said they , `` Wait , and we will pay thee off !"
and arranged with each other to play him a trick.
But the noise of the milking prevented his being understood.
`` Where art thou ?"
asked he.
`` In the black one ,"
Next morning the cow was killed.
No one heard this because of the noise of the chopping-knife.
But his liberty did not last long.
`` Hollo , Mr.
Fox ,"
`` Thou art right ,"
answered the fox.
`` With all my heart ,"
replied Thumbling.
`` Thou shalt have all the cocks and hens , that I promise thee"
Then the fox let him go again , and himself carried him home.
`` For this I likewise bring thee a handsome bit of money ,"
`` But why did the fox get the poor chickens to eat ?"
`` Is it a he or a she ?"
inquired the queen.
`` I wish to purchase a she fish"
On hearing this the fish laughed aloud.
`` It 's a he ,"
replied the fisherwoman , and proceeded on her rounds.
`` Are you indisposed ?"
he said.
`` A fish laugh ! Impossible ! You must be dreaming"
`` I am not a fool.
`` Passing strange ! Be it so.
I will inquire concerning it"
He sought everywhere and from every one.
The old farmer agreed , and they walked along together.
The day was hot , and the way was long and weary.
said the youth.
`` What a fool the man is !"
thought the old farmer.
`` Is this eaten or not ?"
said the young man.
`` What a large cemetery !"
exclaimed the young man.
`` What does the man mean ,"
thought the old farmer , `` calling this largely populated city a cemetery ?"
`` What a splendid city this is !"
said the young man.
`` Now , the man must surely be demented !"
thought the old farmer.
However , he kept his thoughts to himself.
said the old man to himself.
`` Thank you very much ,"
The old farmer left him in despair , and entered his house laughing.
`` There is a man in yonder field ,"
he said , after returning their greetings.
The man must be mad !"
and saying this , he burst into a fit of laughter.
`` Father ,"
He only wishes to know if you can afford to entertain him"
`` Oh ! of course ,"
replied the farmer.
`` I see.
`` Most assuredly ,"
said the girl.
`` Oh yes.
`` I see ,"
said the farmer.
`` True , true !"
said the astonished farmer.
`` I admire his wisdom ,"
replied the girl.
This friend of yours is a most wise man.
I should like to see him and speak to him"
`` Very well ,"
His father foolishly complied.
`` Give your mistress my salam ,"
After a little while the young man appeared with the old farmer.
`` The laughing of the fish ,"
`` Joy , joy !"
exclaimed the vizier 's son.
`` Never !"
said the king.
`` But it must be so , Your Majesty ,"
We 'll soon find out whether there is any man there"
All of them tried , but only one succeeded.
they at last consented , and gave him the child.
`` No ,"
answered they , `` he 's a foundling.
`` Just as the King commands ,"
answered they , and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness.
`` I come from the mill ,"
`` You poor boy ,"
`` Let them come ,"
and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.
`` How has that come to pass ?"
said he ; `` I gave quite another order in my letter"
`` I know nothing about it ,"
In this way the King hoped to be rid of him for ever.
thereupon he took leave of them and began his journey.
`` I know everything ,"
answered the luck-child.
`` Then you can do us a favor ,"
`` That you shall know ,"
answered he ; `` only wait until I come back"
`` I know everything ,"
answered he.
`` You shall know that ,"
answered he ; `` only wait until I come back"
`` I know everything ,"
answered he.
`` Then you can do me a favor ,"
`` You shall know that ,"
answered he ; `` only wait until I come back"
When he had crossed the water he found the entrance to Hell.
`` What do you want ?"
said she to him , but she did not look so very wicked.
answered he , `` else I can not keep my wife"
`` That is a good deal to ask for ,"
`` Yes ,"
`` Those are difficult questions ,"
As the evening came on , the devil returned home.
`` I smell man 's flesh ,"
said he ; `` all is not right here"
His grandmother scolded him.
`` It has just been swept ,"
Sit down and eat your supper"
`` Oh !"
cried the devil , `` what are you doing ?"
`` I have had a bad dream ,"
answered the grandmother , `` so I seized hold of your hair"
`` What did you dream then ?"
said the devil.
`` Oh , ho ! if they did but know it ,"
He went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook.
Then she pulled the second hair out.
`` Ha ! what are you doing ?"
cried the devil angrily.
`` Do not take it ill ,"
said she , `` I did it in a dream"
`` What have you dreamt this time ?"
asked he.
What , think you , was the reason ?"
`` Oh ! if they did but know ,"
answered the devil.
The grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored.
`` What was the dream , then ?"
asked he , and was quite curious.
What is the cause of it ?"
`` Ah ! the fool ,"
`` There are the three golden hairs for you ,"
said she.
`` Yes ,"
answered he , `` I heard , and will take care to remember"
`` You have what you want ,"
said she , `` and now you can go your way"
`` Ferry me across first ,"
At last he came to the town whose well was dry.
`` I was rowed across a river ,"
`` Can I too fetch some of it ?"
said the King ; and he was quite eager about it.
`` As much as you like ,"
answered he.
-- Then will I trace For thy instruction her transcendent grace.
Let me have your daughter with me in the palace.
`` Now spin me this flax ,"
I care not for that , thy indefatigable industry is dowry enough"
`` With all my heart ,"
she replied , `` do but come in and begin the work at once"
`` I have three aunts ,"
`` Ah ,"
said the bridegroom , `` how comest thou by these odious friends ?"
`` By treading ,"
she answered , `` by treading"
`` By licking ,"
she answered , `` by licking"
`` By twisting the thread ,"
she answered , `` by twisting the thread"
And thus she got rid of the hateful flax-spinning"
`` Oh , very badly ,"
And having said all this , the elf vanished.
`` Ah ! old water-splasher , is it thou ?"
`` Be quiet , and do not weep ,"
`` Whatever thou wilt have , dear frog ,"
`` Oh yes ,"
`` Wait , wait ,"
said the frog.
`` Take me with thee.
I ca n't run as thou canst"
`` Ah , no ,"
replied she.
`` It is no giant but a disgusting frog"
`` What does a frog want with thee ?"
Go and let him in"
There he sat and cried , `` Lift me up beside thee"
She delayed , until at last the King commanded her to do it.
`` Now , thou wilt be quiet , odious frog ,"
said she.
The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom.
So he turned round and cried , `` Henry , the carriage is breaking"
`` No , master , it is not the carriage.
`` Listen ,"
answered the countryman.
Then the King said that he must now bring him the pestle.
and would neither eat nor drink.
and what it was that his daughter had said.
She at once said yes , she would guess it.
He called his attendants , but none of them were there.
`` That is the King of birds ,"
said the wolf , `` before whom we must bow down"
It was , however , in reality the willow-wren -LRB- Zaunk nig -RRB-.
`` If that 's the case ,"
`` That is not done quite as you seem to think ,"
said the wolf ; `` you must wait until the Queen comes"
`` Is that the royal palace ?"
`` Good ,"
said the fox , `` but what signal shall we agree upon ?"
.
`` I hardly know myself ,"
`` That is not so difficult ,"
`` Thou art a goose , who art always frightened ,"
said the eldest.
`` Do n't be so silly !"
said the eldest , `` you have caught it on a nail"
The soldier thought , `` I must carry a token away with me ,"
The youngest cried out again.
`` Something is wrong , did you hear the crack ?"
`` What should cause that ,"
he answered , `` In an underground castle with twelve princes ,"
`` I will take great care ,"
said Little Red-Cap to her mother , and gave her hand on it.
`` Good-day , Little Red-Cap ,"
said he.
`` Thank you kindly , wolf"
`` Whither away so early , Little Red-Cap ?"
`` To my grandmother 's"
`` What have you got in your apron ?"
`` Where does your grandmother live , Little Red-Cap ?"
replied Little Red-Cap.
I must act craftily , so as to catch both"
`` Who is there ?"
`` Little Red-Cap ,"
replied the wolf.
`` She is bringing cake and wine ; open the door"
`` Lift the latch ,"
She called out , `` Good morning ,"
`` Oh ! grandmother ,"
she said , `` what big ears you have !"
`` The better to hear you with , my child ,"
was the reply.
`` But , grandmother , what big eyes you have !"
she said.
`` The better to see you with , my dear"
`` But , grandmother , what large hands you have !"
`` The better to hug you with"
`` The better to eat you with !"
`` Do I find thee here , thou old sinner !"
said he.
`` I have long sought thee !"
Then all three were delighted.
`` Well ,"
But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.
Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full.
But Red-Cap went joyously home , and never did anything to harm any one"
It was in vain , too , that the bride offered her gold.
He took her by the hand and led her to church.
`` What art thou saying ?"
asked the King 's son.
`` Nothing ,"
she replied , `` I was only thinking of Maid Maleen"
He was surprised that she knew about her , but kept silence.
`` What art thou saying there ?"
asked the King 's son.
`` Nothing ,"
she replied , `` I was only thinking of Maid Maleen"
`` Dost thou know Maid Maleen ?"
`` No ,"
`` What art thou saying there ?"
asked he.
`` Ah ,"
she answered , `` I was only thinking of Maid Maleen"
`` To which nettle-plant ?"
asked she ; `` I do n't talk to nettle-plants"
said he.
She went out and sought Maid Maleen.
`` Girl , what hast thou been saying to the nettle ?"
and she repeated the words which she had just heard.
asked the King 's son.
`` To the foot-bridge ?"
she answered.
`` I do n't talk to foot-bridges"
`` Then thou art not the true bride"
`` That costs thee thy life !"
and she repeated the words.
`` But what didst thou say to the church-door ?"
`` To the church-door ?"
she replied ; `` I do n't talk to church-doors"
`` Then thou art not the true bride"
`` That will break thy neck for thee !"
and she repeated the words.
`` What jewel ?"
she answered ; `` thou didst not give me any jewel"
`` Where is the girl ?"
`` Thou art the true bride ,"
To-day , however , the sun is shining on me once more.
There was once on a time a princess who was extremely proud.
`` If that be all ,"
The princess said , `` Wrongly guessed ; let the second answer"
`` Wrongly guessed ,"
said the little tailor , `` I will soon make thee quiet"
`` Eh !"
`` There , see what a stupid fellow thou art !"
But no one will imagine that he accomplished it.
`` Light enough for a child.
`` So ,"
What dost thou think of that ? Wilt thou give me lessons ?"
`` With all my heart ,"
said the tailor , `` if thou hast a talent for it.
The bear in great fury ran after the carriage.
When the bear saw that , he turned round and ran away.
Whosoever does not believe this , must pay a thaler"
She washed and scrubbed , but she could not get it out.
`` Since thou hast gone into the room against my will ,"
said he , `` thou shalt go back into it against thine own.
Thy life is ended"
Then he threw her into the basin with the rest.
`` Now I will fetch myself the second ,"
She did not fare better than her sister.
Then they rejoiced and kissed and caressed each other.
`` Oh , very well ,"
Wilt thou go on at once ?"
Wilt thou go on directly ?"
`` I come from Fitcher 's house quite near"
`` And what may the young bride be doing ?"
At last she met the bridegroom , who was coming slowly back.
`` I come from Fitcher 's house quite near"
The two remained standing full of astonishment , and watched the dance.
A heavy weight on their limbs awakened them earlier than usual.
But he stayed another day to please him.
`` Even if the gold does weigh heavily ,"
said he , `` I will gladly bear that ,"
`` The gold I got the night before is still there for me ,"
The story is as follows.
No sooner said than done.
`` I am taking a walk ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` A walk !"
said the hare , with a smile.
`` That is just what I do think ,"
said the hare.
`` That can be put to the test ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` I wager that if we run a race , I will outstrip you"
`` That is ridiculous ! You with your short legs !"
What shall we wager ?"
`` A golden louis-d ` or and a bottle of brandy ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` Done ,"
said the hare.
`` Nay ,"
In half-an-hour I will be back again at this place"
Hereupon the hedgehog departed , for the hare was quite satisfied with this.
`` What is going on , then ?"
said his wife.
I am to run a race with him , and thou must be present"
`` Good heavens , husband ,"
`` Hold thy tongue , woman ,"
said the hedgehog , `` that is my affair.
Do n't begin to discuss things which are matters for men.
Be off , dress thyself , and come with me"
Look you , I will make the long field our race-course.
When he reached the top , the hare was already there.
`` Shall we start ?"
said the hare.
`` Certainly ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` Then both at once"
So saying , each placed himself in his own furrow.
The hare counted , `` Once , twice , thrice , and away !"
and went off like a whirlwind down the field.
But the hedgehog 's wife stayed quietly in her place.
`` All right ,"
Now Shiro means `` white ,"
and he was so called because of his color.
Then the old man said `` Chin , chin !"
But Shiro went on barking and digging with all his might.
At last all the gold coins lay shining on the ground.
Thus in one day the poor old man became rich.
The old man 's disgust can be imagined.
This soon gave way to anger.
Shiro 's master then cut the tree down and carried it home.
Out of the trunk he made a mortar.
They tasted the cakes and found them nicer than any other food.
The good old man said : `` I am very sorry for that.
I would have given you as many as ever you wanted.
`` And ,"
I shall look on"
Saying `` Excuse me ,"
This would be the simplest task of all.
I have nothing to do to - day.
Let him try his art again ; it will amuse me to look on"
So the retainers went out and brought in the impostor before their Lord.
The satisfaction of false old man can now be imagined.
`` That is strange !"
said the Daimio.
`` I am the true Hana-Saka-Jijii.
The one who came to you before was only my disciple !"
replied the old man again.
`` Then you must be more skillful than the other.
Try what you can do and let me see !"
But all to no effect.
From this imprisonment the wicked old man was never freed.
A duck arrived from Portugal.
`` He annoys me with his loud crowing !"
observed the person_0 duck.
I call it Portugal.
`` That 's just like the cat ; she 's a villain !"
said the person_0 duck.
`` I remember her ways when I had children of my own.
`` Poor little creature !"
they said , as one after another came up.
`` We certainly ca n't sing ,"
`` But I can talk of it ,"
`` That 's a good deed ,"
she said : `` the others may take example by it"
`` Piep !"
`` You are very kind-hearted , madam ,"
he said ; but he did not wish for a second bath.
`` I have never thought about my heart ,"
`` She 's quite full of Portulak ,"
`` The person_0 has certainly a greater command of language ,"
they said.
`` You have a lovely voice ,"
said one of the oldest.
`` Do n't plague him so ,"
interposed the person_0 duck : `` he requires rest and nursing.
`` Oh no ! pray let me be dry !"
was the little bird 's petition.
`` The water-cure is the only remedy for me when I am unwell ,"
quoth the person_0.
There are two Cochin Chinese among them.
`` You are a true singing bird ,"
The two Chinese stood quite enchanted with the appearance of the singing bird.
`` He 's charming ,"
-LRB- Illustration : THE LITTLE SINGING BIRD RECEIVES DISTINGUISHED PATRONAGE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` We are of your race ,"
they continued.
It can not even be said of the inhabitants of the duck-yard.
whispered one duck to her friend.
`` They annoy me -- we have never spoken to them"
Now the drake came up.
He thought the little singing bird was a sparrow.
`` Well , I do n't understand the difference ,"
he said ; `` and indeed it 's all the same thing.
`` Do n't attach any value to what he says ,"
the person_0 whispered.
But now I shall lie down for a rest.
The little singing bird busied himself with his broken wing.
But the neighbour 's fowls were awake.
At this the other ducks laughed and cackled aloud.
`` Ducky dotard ,"
they whispered ; `` that 's too witty !"
And then they lay down.
`` Piep !"
he cried ; `` you trod very hard upon me , madam"
`` Well , why do you lie in my way ?"
the duck retorted.
`` You must not be so touchy.
`` Now I want to rest after my dinner ,"
said the person_0.
I want to sleep now"
`` Give that to a chicken !"
she said , `` and do n't be always standing in my way"
`` Why are you angry with me ?"
replied the little singing bird.
`` What have I done ?"
`` Done !"
`` Yesterday it was sunshine here ,"
`` You do n't know much about the weather , I fancy ,"
retorted the person_0.
`` The day is not done yet.
Do n't stand there looking so stupid"
`` Impertinent creature !"
I 've taken your part , and will teach you good manners"
`` Now , what 's the meaning of this ?"
`` You 'll kill me with your crowing !"
she cried.
`` It 's all your fault.
He 's lost his head , and I am very near losing mine"
`` There 's not much lying where he fell !"
observed the cock.
`` Speak of him with respect ,"
And all the ducks came crowding round the little dead singing bird.
`` We 've hearts of our own ,"
they said ; `` nobody can deny that"
`` Hearts !"
`` Let us think of getting something to satisfy our hunger ,"
said the drake , `` for that 's the most important point.
Dost thou imagine thou art to idle away the whole day ?"
The maiden looked up , and an old woman was by her side.
The girl lay down on her bed , and soon fell asleep.
`` Just look , you awkward creature ,"
I must give her some work that is still harder"
`` It ought to have been done long before this ,"
`` I will endure no opposition ,"
screamed the step-mother.
She hurried to the castle , and entered by the open door.
The girl went and told her that the castle was ready.
`` I will move into it at once ,"
said she , and rose from her seat.
`` Thou seest ,"
`` Now we will go down below ,"
said she , looking at the girl with malicious eyes.
Nothing was wanting , not even a coal-box and water-pail.
`` Which is the way to the cellar ?"
she cried.
`` If that is not abundantly filled , it shall go ill with thee"
And now the magnificent castle belonged to the girl alone.
Wooers presented themselves daily , but none pleased her.
I will wait here under the lime-tree until thou returnest"
the little calf knelt down , and she stroked it.
`` Alas !"
Next day he again came along the road.
`` Alas !"
said she , `` he no longer knows me ,"
and her grief was ever greater.
`` Now will I try my last chance ,"
`` Do but tell who thou art ,"
`` Dost thou not know what I did when thou leftest me ?"
`` Come ,"
said he to her , `` here I stay no longer ,"
gave her his hand , and led her down to the carriage.
The illuminated windows already shone in the distance.
It shook its branches , and sent forth their fragrance.
Long , long ago there lived a man called Sentaro.
His surname meant `` Millionaire ,"
The idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched.
`` I should like to live ,"
The ordinary span of a man 's life is very short"
He could not get away from it.
Ah -- if only he could find the `` Elixir of Life ,"
he would be happy.
of which he had so often read and heard.
Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever.
`` Can you tell me ,"
`` No"
It is said that he is chief of a band of two hundred followers"
Sentaro obeyed wonderingly.
On and on they went for thousands of miles.
After several days they reached an island.
The crane flew some distance inland and then alighted.
He walked first round about the country and then through the town.
All this Sentaro soon found out by talking to the islanders.
Everything was upside down.
He had wished to escape from dying.
Vainly they tried to imagine what death could be like.
Sentaro was delighted.
He was the only happy man on the island.
This caused him great annoyance.
He tried to stop the bird in vain.
Sentaro fell with it.
He looked round , but there was no ship in sight.
He was in a cold perspiration with fright , and utterly bewildered.
and did not touch it , but went onwards.
`` What shall I do ?"
`` This time ,"
said he , `` my wish has been fulfilled at the right moment"
and folded it up tidily and put it in his pocket.
`` Now I perceive ,"
said he , `` in what kitchen my cooking is done.
Thou shalt be dearer to me than the mountains of silver and gold"
For he saw plainly that it was a wishing-cloth.
`` Good evening , blackbird !"
said the youth.
`` How dost thou get on in thy solitude ?"
`` One day is like another ,"
`` Many thanks ,"
`` Who is to prepare it for thee ?"
said the charcoal-burner.
`` And yet there shall be a meal ,"
answered the youth , `` and better than any thou hast ever tasted"
`` I must first know what these wonderful powers are ,"
answered the youth.
`` That will I tell thee ,"
`` So far as I am concerned ,"
`` March with all speed to the charcoal-burner , and demand my wishing-cloth back"
said the sooty fellow.
`` No , he replied , this time thou shalt be my guest ,"
They ate and drank together , and enjoyed themselves heartily.
`` That suits me very well ,"
`` One thing comes on the top of another ,"
Neither had his thoughts deceived him.
`` Now ,"
and they drove him out of doors.
The King said , `` This vagabond is not brought to order yet ,"
`` And now ,"
`` Dear child ,"
And he revealed to her the wonderful virtue with which it was endowed.
But his hands were scarcely at liberty before he turned it twice.
The persimmon-seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone.
The simple-minded crab could not resist the monkey 's clever persuasion.
`` How delicious they will be to eat !"
he said to himself.
The persimmon is as hard as stone when it is unripe.
At this dreadful sight the poor young crab sat down and wept.
In a short time the bee and the chestnut arrived.
Little did he know in his so-called `` monkey 's wisdom"
that this seeming unconcern was part of the young crab 's plan.
So the monkey returned home from his walk quite content.
He told himself he had nothing now to fear.
My master hopes you will honor his house with your kind visit"
We were great friends as you know.
I accept your kind invitation with many thanks.
I shall be delighted to do honor to my poor old friend !"
And he screwed some false tears from his eyes.
But aloud he thanked the monkey politely and went home.
Here the young chief mourner came to receive him.
Time passed and still he did not return.
At last the monkey became impatient.
I am tired of waiting so long.
I am very thirsty after drinking so much sake at the dinner !"
`` Then you -- are -- my -- enemy ?"
gasped the monkey brokenly.
`` Of course ,"
said the young crab.
gasped the unrepentant monkey.
Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.
Let her get the fire at her own house.
Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters.
I can not tell how it is"
The girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother.
Let us rather invite her to come and have some of the fruit"
And calling her to them , they gave her one of the pomeloes.
I ate one , and it was the nicest I have ever tasted"
Then they all began to cry very bitterly.
I can not tell how it is !"
And her daughter said , `` I will watch"
He replied , `` Yes , whatever it is , I will do it"
He found them crying by the ruins of their mother 's grave.
Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him , or marry you"
At hearing which they let him go without further questioning.
I have found what I seek at last"
To this the Prince agreed.
`` And do tell me ,"
`` Why do you ask ?"
said he.
`` Because ,"
`` It is true ,"
he added , `` that I am not as others.
It is , however ,"
So saying , he went away.
`` Sir ,"
replied the Prince , `` I will not sell my parrot"
`` It is done as you desire ,"
said the Magician , `` only give me my parrot"
`` Now , give me my parrot ,"
repeated Punchkin.
`` Not so fast , my master ,"
`` Give me my parrot !"
cried Punchkin.
`` Give me my parrot !"
cried he , and fell on his knees.
`` Take your parrot , then ,"
`` What fine linen ,"
said he , and put one piece in his pocket.
`` What do you want ?"
he asked.
`` Give me back my dress ,"
`` You shall have it back again ,"
said the drummer , `` if you will tell me who you are"
`` Ah ,"
I entreat you to give me my dress back"
`` Be easy , poor child ,"
said the drummer.
`` I will willingly give it back to you"
`` Stop a moment , perhaps I can help you"
`` When I want to do a thing I always can do it ,"
But I do not know the way which leads to the glass-mountain"
she answered , `` and more than that , I dare not tell you"
And then he heard her wings quiver , as she flew away.
`` Wretch !"
`` I am drumming ,"
`` What do they want in my forest ?"
demanded the giant.
`` Oho !"
`` Dost thou think thou canst do anything against us ?"
`` Listen , little fellow ,"
`` Thou hast long legs ,"
`` Come here , worm ,"
and so it was.
`` If one was a bird now ,"
`` What fools you are ,"
`` The saddle is worth fighting about ,"
The saddle belongs to us in common.
`` I will soon decide the quarrel ,"
He went to the door and knocked.
`` Entrance , food , and a bed for the night ,"
replied the drummer.
`` That thou shalt have ,"
said the old woman , `` if thou wilt perform three services in return"
`` Why not ?"
`` That is strange work ,"
So he gave it up and sat down.
He looked at her , and saw that she was wondrously beautiful.
`` Ah ,"
`` Stay here ,"
said the maiden , `` I will help thee out of thy difficulty.
When thou awakest again , thy work will be done"
The drummer did not need to be told that twice.
Fishes , come out"
'"
She gave him an axe , a mallet , and two wedges.
`` Lay thy head on my lap ,"
'"
`` For thee , thou witch ,"
he replied , and gave her a blow with it.
The maiden , however , did not desert him in his need.
`` Listen to me ,"
The maiden departed , and the old woman came sneaking up to him.
`` Oh , I am cold ,"
He carried the log out , and laid it down.
`` I do not like the old saddle ,"
`` Very well , then ,"
answered the drummer , `` then wish us in front of the town-gate"
`` Ah ,"
said the King 's daughter , `` I beg thee to be careful.
`` How can I forget thee ?"
The son was content to do as his parents desired"
When all the guests were assembled , she entered the hall.
`` Not for money ,"
Sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest.
Suddenly , his memory returned to him.
`` Ah ,"
`` This is my true bride ,"
There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage.
Rose-red answered , `` Never so long as we live ,"
`` Poor bear ,"
`` Where are you going , then , dear bear ?"
asked Snow-white.
`` What are you about there , little man ?"
asked Rose-red.
`` You stupid , prying goose !"
`` I will run and fetch some one ,"
said Rose-red.
`` You senseless goose !"
`` Do n't be impatient ,"
said Snow-white , `` I will help you ,"
Bad luck to you !"
They ran to it and found it was the dwarf.
`` Where are you going ?"
`` I am not such a fool !"
I can not let myself be seen by my people.
I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes !"
Directly afterwards they heard a loud , piteous cry.
`` Why do you stand gaping there ?"
cried the dwarf , and his ashen-gray face became copper-red with rage.
Then in the dread of his heart he cried , `` Dear Mr.
`` I am a King 's son ,"
Now he has got his well-deserved punishment"
`` Yes , it was I ,"
Do you think you can grant it to me ?"
`` If it is in my power to do so I will ,"
answered Hidesato , `` but first tell me who you are ?"
`` And what is it you have to ask of me !"
said Hidesato.
I am powerless to save them.
I beg you to have pity upon me.
Will you not help me and kill my enemy the centipede ?"
Hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him.
The Dragon King stood by the warrior 's side trembling with fear.
It is coming for its prey ! Now is the time to kill it"
Hidesato showed not the least sign of fear.
He tried to calm the Dragon King.
`` Do n't be afraid.
I shall surely kill the centipede.
Just bring me my bow and arrows"
He looked across the waters.
But this was no ordinary centipede.
Hidesato determined to try his last chance.
At last the dreadful night was over.
Day dawned beautiful and clear.
The centipede was gone from the mountain.
The gratitude of the Dragon King knew no bounds.
Another feast was prepared , more sumptuous than the first.
Second , a bag of rice.
Third , a roll of silk.
Fourth , a cooking pot.
Fifth , a bell.
The cooking pot was wonderful , too.
Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed.
Now began a bad time for the poor step-child.
`` Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor with us ?"
said they.
`` Just look at the proud princess , how decked out she is !"
they cried , and laughed , and led her into the kitchen.
.
`` Beautiful dresses ,"
said one , `` Pearls and jewels ,"
said the second.
`` And thou , Cinderella ,"
said he , `` what wilt thou have ?"
Then he broke off the branch and took it with him.
And it grew , however , and became a handsome tree.
`` Thou go , Cinderella !"
And she thought to herself , `` That she most certainly can not do"
for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged.
She escaped from him , however , and sprang into the pigeon-house.
The old man thought , `` Can it be Cinderella ?"
The father thought , `` Can it be Cinderella ?"
Then were the two sisters glad , for they had pretty feet.
Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again.
`` This also is not the right one ,"
said he , `` have you no other daughter ?"
`` No ,"
He absolutely insisted on it , and Cinderella had to be called.
Wife 'Twas clearly I , howe'er , for her you took.
-- Wife Indeed I do , 'twas myself.
Neighbour A flannel petticoat display 'd the elf.
Wife How hard of credence ! -- 'twas myself I vow.
I would rather go away and see how I can earn my bread"
`` If he loves me with all his heart ,"
said she , `` of what use will life be to him afterwards ?"
`` But dost thou know what thou must promise ?"
said the King.
`` I must be buried with her ,"
Then the King consented , and the wedding was solemnized with great splendor.
and hewed the snake in three pieces.
`` Thou art with me , dear wife ,"
`` Ah , dear father ,"
He was present at his death , and can tell you all"
The King said , `` I will make the dead alive again ,"
and opened the chamber , and bade the two come out.
The King said , `` There is no mercy.
said he to her , `` or I shall starve"
`` Oho !"
`` What do you wish ?"
said the soldier.
`` That you should dig all round my garden for me , tomorrow"
`` I see well enough ,"
`` No ,"
`` This shall be my last pleasure ,"
`` What commands have I to give thee ?"
replied the soldier , quite astonished.
`` I must do everything thou biddest me ,"
said the little man.
`` Good ,"
`` It is all done ,"
said he , `` and the witch is already hanging on the gallows.
What further commands has my lord ?"
inquired the dwarf.
`` At this moment , none ,"
Thereupon he vanished from his sight.
The soldier returned to the town from which he had come.
`` What am I to do ?"
asked the little man.
`` Aha ! art thou there ?"
`` I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning ,"
`` The dream may have been true ,"
said the King , `` I will give thee a piece of advice.
`` We must think of something else ,"
`` Do what I bid thee ,"
His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted.
`` Have no fear ,"
said the latter to his master.
`` What is it ?"
asked the King.
`` That I may smoke one more pipe on my way"
`` Thou mayst smoke three ,"
If the mistress gets to know it , she will beat us"
The countryman said , `` She will know nothing about it.
Do come ; after all , she never gives you anything good"
So they just had to run away"
This he did , and lived contentedly and happily with her"
Now , evaporated apples are nothing more or less than dried apples.
Now you see what made person_0 Coon feel so queer and uncomfortable.
He had first eaten his dried apples.
But he did it , though it cost him a few groans.
And he frightened his mother , too.
`` I only hope you 're not poisoned ,"
she said , when person_0 told her what he had been doing.
And that remark frightened person_0 more than ever.
He was sure he was never going to feel any better.
Poor Mrs.
Coon was much worried all the rest of the night.
But when morning came she knew that person_0 was out of danger.
She knew it because of something he said.
So now Fatty hurried to see what the strange thing was.
Fatty Coon looked carefully at the bright thing.
And at last he thought he knew what it was.
`` Oh ! the moon ! the moon !"
Fatty shouted.
And that was all he could say.
`` Well , well ! What about the moon !"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
`` Anybody would think you had found it , almost"
And she smiled.
Fatty puffed and gasped.
And at last he caught his breath again.
he said.
`` Well , well , well !"
Mrs.
Coon was puzzled.
`` Are you sure ?"
she asked.
`` Oh , yes , Mother !"
Fatty could hardly wait , he was so eager to lead the way.
And with many a shake of the head , Mrs.
Coon , with her family , started off to see the moon.
`` There !"
`` There it is -- just as I told you !"
And they all set up a great shouting.
All but Mrs.
Coon.
And she walked close to the shining thing and peered at it.
But not too close ! Mrs.
Coon did n't go too near it.
And she told her children quite sternly to stand back.
It was well that she did ; for when Mrs.
A trap ! THAT was what Mrs.
Coon saw right in front of her.
And there he would have been , caught fast.
It was no wonder that Mrs.
Coon hurried her family away from that spot.
And Fatty led them all home again.
He could n't get away from his moon fast enough"
`` I can help thee to do that ,"
said the fox.
`` Come to me early to-morrow morning , and I will show thee one"
First came an old discharged soldier.
`` Is that a man ?"
inquired the wolf.
`` No ,"
answered the fox , `` that was one"
Afterwards came a little boy who was going to school.
`` Is that a man ?"
`` No , that is going to be one"
The wolf then rushed on the man.
aimed , and fired his small shot in his face.
`` Well , brother wolf ,"
said the fox , `` how hast thou got on with man ?"
`` Ah !"
`` See what a braggart thou art !"
said the fox.
Fundevogel said , `` Neither now , nor ever will I leave thee"
Then said Lina , `` Then I will tell thee.
Fundevogel said , `` Neither now , nor ever"
Then said they , `` There is nothing to be done here ,"
They had therefore to go out and look for the second time.
The children , however , saw them coming from a distance.
Fundevogel said , `` Neither now , nor ever"
Then said Fundevogel , `` Neither now , nor ever"
`` I will see to it , master ,"
answered Grethel.
The master said , `` I will run myself , and fetch the guest"
and took a good drink , and took yet another hearty draught.
`` Yes , sir , I will soon serve up ,"
answered Grethel.
Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it !"
`` Eh , why , Grethel ? What do you mean by that ?"
`` Yes ,"
`` That 's a nice trick !"
said her master , and lamented the fine chickens.
`` Thirty years ,"
replied God ; `` does that content thee ?"
`` Ah , Lord ,"
answered the ass , `` that is a long time.
Relieve me of a portion of this long time"
Then God had pity on him and relieved him of eighteen years.
The ass went away comforted , and the dog appeared.
`` How long wouldst thou like to live ?"
said God to him.
`` Lord ,"
Then came the monkey.
`` Thou wilt certainly live thirty years willingly ?"
said the Lord to him.
`` Ah ! Lord ,"
When it rains porridge I have no spoon.
God was gracious and took off ten.
`` Thirty years shalt thou live ,"
said the Lord.
`` Is that enough for thee ?"
`` What a short time ,"
`` I will add to it the ass 's eighteen years ,"
said God.
`` That is not enough ,"
replied the man.
`` Thou shalt also have the dog 's twelve years"
`` Still too little !"
`` Well , then ,"
The man went away , but was not satisfied.
So man lives seventy years.
`` Yes ,"
So she did all he bade her.
`` No ,"
`` I have washed thy dishes already ,"
said she.
`` I have made thy bed already ,"
said she.
`` If that is all ,"
`` Hollo ,"
`` No ,"
said he , `` I see very well that winding wo n't do ,"
`` Wife ,"
`` I 'll tell you what ,"
`` Yes , that will do ,"
said the man.
but she was secretly contriving another trick.
The man was willing and took good care not to loiter.
But you yourself must own she was an odious woman !"
She walked about and looked for a road , but could find none.
`` With all my heart ,"
said the girl.
The girl went to the little house , and came to the door.
The girl gave her no answer , and opened the door.
`` Whither away ,"
My inclination to trade revived.
I made a very good meal , and afterwards fell asleep.
I was very much surprised to find the ship gone.
It was at least fifty paces round.
I had scarcely laid me down before the eagles came.
Here I exchanged some of my diamonds for good merchandise.
My father left me the best inheritance ; to wit -- good humor.
I am not quite young.
The newspaper every one can read for himself.
I heard it from my father , or found it out myself.
Now we are in the churchyard.
As if that was of any consequence.
`` They 're like wet wood this evening ,"
he would say ; `` they wo n't kindle at all !"
Here rests a very happy man.
That is to say , a very grand man.
-LRB- Illustration : THE CHURCHYARD NARRATION.
Here is a maiden of another kind.
Here 's a family sepulchre.
The great poet Goethe concludes his `` Faust"
with the words `` may be continued ;"
and our wanderings in the churchyard may be continued too.
And that 's my story"
Then said he , `` Tell Faithful John to come to me"
I will show thee thy father 's palace"
`` There is something within it ,"
he replied , `` which would terrify thee"
and he went and tried to break open the door by force.
`` Ah , no ,"
I shall not leave the place now until thou hast unlocked the door"
Then he strengthened him with wine , until he came to himself again.
`` That is the princess of the Golden Dwelling ,"
answered Faithful John.
I will give my life to win her.
Thou art my most Faithful John , thou must help me"
`` Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me ,"
So he answered , `` I am a merchant ,"
and opened his apron , and let her look in.
Then she cried , `` Oh , what beautiful gold things !"
`` Ah ,"
`` Yes ,"
replied the second , `` but he has not got her yet"
Spake the second , `` But is there no escape ?"
Said the third , `` Is there no escape at all ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
`` But what avails that ?"
`` Good ,"
said the King , `` he shall carry me to my palace ,"
`` Yes ,"
answered the King , `` it shall be granted unto thee"
Then cried the King , `` Oh , my most Faithful John.
Pardon , pardon -- bring him down"
He said to the King , `` Thy truth shall not go unrewarded ,"
`` Yes ,"
and told her how everything had occurred.
Then they dwelt together in much happiness until their death"
`` Thou wouldst go out with me ?"
said the father.
Whilst he was there , a great giant came over the hill.
`` Do thou see that great bogie ?"
But the giant thought , `` We must do better than that ,"
took him back again , and suckled him two years longer.
`` Now that will do ,"
said the giant , `` thou art perfect ,"
and took him back to the field from whence he had brought him.
His father was there following the plough.
The farmer said , `` That is our son"
Then she said , `` Yes ,"
`` No ,"
she replied , `` that is all we have"
`` But that was only a taste , I must have more"
`` At length come a few crumbs ,"
`` Yes ,"
So he asked , `` How much wages dost thou want ?"
`` I do n't want any at all ,"
`` Yes ,"
`` Ah ,"
And then he stayed in bed two hours longer.
`` Do n't you see ,"
and drove on , and the others had to stay where they were.
`` No ,"
The head-servant consented to this delay.
So the bailiff cried , `` Sh-sh ,"
and pretended to frighten the hens away.
and behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing round his neck.
Then he went into the mill , and poured out the corn.
And so it continued the whole night.
At daybreak , however , everything ceased.
She cried , `` No , no I can not bear it ,"
Her husband cried , `` Do come to me ,"
and he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head.
`` Ah !"
`` I must ,"
`` I will tell you what ,"
`` With all my heart ,"
Never again will I mount it.
What would I not give to have such a cow"
`` Well ,"
Good heart , what more can I want ?"
`` I can find a cure for this ,"
`` What sort of a trick is this ?"
cried he , and helped the good Hans up.
Hans told him what had happened.
`` Well , well ,"
`` Hark ye , Hans ,"
`` Heaven repay you for your kindness !"
`` Just lift her ,"
`` Yes ,"
`` Look here ,"
The good Hans was terrified.
`` Goodness !"
`` I shall risk something at that game ,"
`` When I think over it properly ,"
How glad my mother will be !"
`` Yes ,"
answered the scissors-grinder , `` the trade has a golden foundation.
But where did you buy that fine goose ?"
`` I did not buy it , but exchanged my pig for it"
`` And the pig ?"
`` That I got for a cow"
`` And the cow ?"
`` I took that instead of a horse"
`` And the horse ?"
`` For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head"
`` And the gold ?"
`` Well , that was my wages for seven years ' service"
`` You have known how to look after yourself each time ,"
said the grinder.
`` How shall I manage that ?"
said Hans.
`` How can you ask ?"
answered Hans.
and he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange.
`` Now ,"
Take it with you and keep it carefully"
`` I must have been born with a caul ,"
`` There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I ,"
he cried out.
He was a Dane , a traveling theater director.
He told me : -LRB- Illustration : THE ANIMATED PUPPETS.
It was wonderful to hear and to see.
All night long I could not go to sleep.
We drank to my success and clinked our glasses.
The Polytechnic student had fully purified me.
I can put my pieces together just as I please.
On this occasion I chose the general `` moving-day"
They were playing at `` going to bed ,"
`` It was splendid !"
`` It 's moving-day to-day ,"
You see , potsherds think everything is stupid.
-LRB- Illustration : THE REJECTED TRAVELLER.
`` Just cast your mind 's eye into that great omnibus.
Thus too , there was a Louis XI.
The girl will not do it.
The maiden refuses.
The third day the hare comes again , and eats the cabbages.
Then all the wedding-guests assembled.
The bride says nothing , but weeps.
The little hare goes away.
The bride again says nothing , and weeps.
The little hare goes away.
`` What sayst thou churl , ` not much ?"
`` What ought I to say , then ?"
asked the youth.
'"
And he again got some blows on his back.
`` What am I to say , then ?"
said he.
`` Thou must say , may God have pity on the poor soul"
`` What dost thou say , thou ill-tempered knave ?"
`` What am I to say , then ?"
She was , however , good and pious.
and went onwards.
and took it off , and gave away that also.
`` Ah ,"
`` What hast thou seen ?"
`` I saw a black man on your steps"
`` That was a collier"
`` Then I saw a green man"
`` That was a huntsman"
`` After that I saw a blood-red man"
`` That was a butcher"
`` Oho !"
said he , neither did he know to whom it could belong.
Then the little louse fell in and burnt herself.
On this the little flea began to scream loudly.
`` Because the louse has burnt herself"
Then the little door began to creak.
`` Have I not reason to creak ?"
`` The little louse has burnt herself , The little flea is weeping"
So the little broom began to sweep frantically.
`` Have I not reason to sweep ?"
So the little cart said , `` Then I will run ,"
and began to run wildly.
`` Have I not reason to run ?"
The ash-heap said , `` Then I will burn furiously ,"
and began to burn in clear flames.
`` Have I not reason to burn ?"
The little tree said , `` Then I will shake myself ,"
`` Have I not reason to shake myself ?"
and she broke her little water-pitcher.
`` Have I not reason to break my water-jug ?"
`` Oh , ho !"
said the spring , `` then I will begin to flow ,"
and began to flow violently.
But these were six times as big as bear tracks.
He followed the trail a little way.
But he was very careful.
The great tracks led straight toward Farmer Green 's house.
And person_0 did not want to go there.
So he hurried home to ask his mother what he had found.
Mrs.
Coon listened to person_0 's story.
said person_0 , meaning the automobile that had given him a great fright.
Do you suppose he 's eaten them up ?"
Mrs.
Coon was puzzled.
And she was somewhat alarmed , too.
She wanted to see those strange tracks herself.
It was not often that he could show his mother anything.
And he was so proud that he almost forgot his fright.
`` I guess you 're glad I have sharp eyes ,"
he said , as they hurried along.
his mother told him.
Mrs.
Coon never liked to hear her children boast.
said person_0.
`` Maybe you do n't think I heard him screech --"
`` When did you hear him screech ?"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
`` This is the first you 've said about SCREECHING.
When was it ?"
`` Last summer ,"
person_0 answered.
Mrs.
Coon did n't smile.
Perhaps she was too worried for that.
`` It may not be the same monster ,"
she said.
`` It may not be a monster at all"
But by this time person_0 was sure he was right.
He was sure he knew more than his mother.
he asked.
But Mrs.
Coon would do no such thing.
`` Show me the tracks ,"
she said firmly.
And so they went on into the woods.
`` There they are !"
person_0 cried , a few minutes later.
`` See , Mother ! They 're even bigger than I said"
He heard a funny noise behind him , then.
`` Those are Farmer Green 's tracks ,"
`` What -- as big as that ?"
person_0 pointed at the huge prints in the snow.
`` Snowshoes !"
Mrs.
Coon said.
So that was all there was to person_0 's monster.
Somehow , he was disappointed.
And person_0 was glad about another thing , too.
`` Oh , Mother ! What is it ?"
he cried.
`` The loggers have come ,"
Mrs.
Coon said.
`` They are cutting down all the big trees in the swamp"
`` Then we 'll have to move , wo n't we ?"
Fatty asked.
`` No ! They wo n't touch this tree ,"
his mother told him.
It 's only the good sound trees that they 'll take"
`` But I thought this was a good tree"
Fatty was puzzled.
But not for the loggers.
They would have little use for it"
Fatty Coon felt better when he heard that.
But he took care that they should not see HIM.
He knew what their bright axes could do.
When night came Fatty had still more fun.
The fire was out.
And the pan rested on a stump close beside it.
Fatty Coon climbed up and crawled right inside the pan.
Fatty had jumped to one side , when the tin pan fell.
But no one stirred.
And then Fatty jumped plump into the ashes.
He stood first on one foot and then on another.
And you might have laughed , because he looked funny.
But Fatty Coon did not laugh.
In fact , he came very near crying.
And he did not wait to eat another mouthful.
He limped along toward home.
It was very hard.
His sisters , Fluffy and Cutey , wanted to go too.
But Fatty would not let them.
`` Girls ca n't be barbers ,"
he said.
And of course they could find no answer to that.
So they finally agreed to take turns.
Fatty offered to cut Blackie 's hair.
So Blackie would n't let Fatty touch him.
`` No , thank you !"
said Fatty.
`` I only get my hair cut once a month"
`` I wo n't !"
said Fatty.
`` I 'm going to stay here just as long as I please"
And he tried to pull his tail out of the hole.
He wanted to get it out now.
`` Go out and see what 's the matter !"
he cried to Blackie.
But Blackie would n't stir.
He was afraid to leave the shelter of the hollow tree.
`` It may be a bear that has hold of your tail ,"
he told Fatty.
And somehow , that idea made Fatty tremble all over.
`` Oh , dear ! oh , dear !"
he wailed.
`` What shall I do ? Oh ! whatever shall I do ?"
He began to cry.
And Blackie cried too.
So Fatty gave up all hope of her helping.
`` Please , Mr.
Bear , let go of my tail !"
he cried , when he could stand the pain no longer.
And that surprised him.
Fatty and Blackie scrambled out of the hollow sycamore.
Fatty looked all around.
`` Did you frighten the bear away , Mother ?"
he asked.
`` There was no bear ,"
Mrs.
Coon told him.
`` And it 's lucky for you that there was n't.
Now , do n't ever do such a foolish thing again.
He could have caught you just as easily as anything"
There were no farmers driving along the road.
Fatty had it all to himself.
And so he walked slowly homewards.
It was then that the terrible monster almost caught him.
This is how it all happened.
There was a br-br-br-r-r-r in the air.
Fatty really should have heard it long before he did.
He was startled.
And he stopped right in the middle of the road to listen.
Fatty had never heard such a sound before.
The strange animal was on him before he knew it.
Its glaring eyes blinded him.
It was a frightful cry -- like six wildcats all wailing together.
He seemed to be running so fast that he could not stop.
Fatty Coon hurried away.
When Fatty told his mother about his narrow escape Mrs.
Coon became much excited.
Mrs.
`` Look , Mother !"
Fatty cried.
Mrs.
Coon looked.
Sure enough ! It was just as Fatty said.
And that horrid call echoed across the valley once more.
`` Where 's the nearest village , please ?"
the stranger asked.
`` Do you suppose he ate up Farmer Green and his family ?"
Fatty asked in a frightened voice.
`` I hope so ,"
she said.
`` Then perhaps there 'll be no more traps in the woods"
`` But who would plant the corn ?"
Fatty asked.
Mrs.
Coon did not appear to hear his question"
Fatty loved to eat.
Yes -- he loved eating better than anything else in the world.
That was what made him so fat.
And that , too , was what led him into many adventures.
Coon , for she was so much bigger than her children.
Mrs.
Coon 's home was in the hollow branch of an old tree.
Coon 's home was as big as most tree-trunks are.
Now , Fatty Coon was forever looking around for something to eat.
He was never satisfied with what his mother brought home for him.
No matter how big a dinner Mrs.
He ate everything.
And he always wanted more.
`` Is this all there is ?"
Fatty Coon asked his mother one day.
He had gobbled up every bit of the nice fish that Mrs.
Coon had brought home for him.
It was gone in no time at all.
Mrs.
Coon sighed.
`` Yes -- that 's all ,"
Fatty said nothing more.
The very next night person_0 set out toward Farmer Green 's.
It was hardly dark.
But person_0 could not wait any longer.
He hurried away alone.
And when he came in sight of the cornfield he felt better.
person_0 felt very happy as he slipped through the rail-fence.
A dog barked.
And that spoiled person_0 's fun.
For the dog was altogether too near for person_0 to feel safe.
It was lucky for person_0 that he started when he did.
For that dog was close behind him in no time.
person_0 looked down at the dog and scolded a little.
He was not afraid.
But it made him cross to be driven out of the cornfield.
And he wished the dog would go away.
When Farmer Green saw person_0 he seemed disappointed.
`` He 's too young to bother with ,"
he said.
`` His skin 's not worth much.
We 'll go ` long and see what we can find"
But Johnnie Green stayed behind.
He wanted that young coon.
And he intended to have him , too.
After a while he appeared again with an axe over his shoulder.
And person_0 began to wish he had stayed away from the cornfield.
He looked up longingly at person_0 Coon.
And Johnnie started to climb the tree himself.
But the higher he climbed , the higher person_0 climbed.
At last Johnnie Green started off , calling his dog after him.
And then person_0 Coon came down.
But he did not go back to the cornfield.
He decided that he had had adventures enough for one night.
But person_0 had learned something -- at least he thought he had.
TREES COULD NOT BE CHOPPED DOWN ! That was what person_0 believed.
Of course it was something to eat -- the surprise.
You must have guessed that , knowing Fatty Coon as you do.
`` Come , children !"
Mrs.
Coon said.
`` Is it something to eat ?"
`` Yes -- and the best thing you ever tasted ,"
Mrs.
Coon said.
Fatty was greatly excited.
His little bright eyes turned green in the moonlight.
He wondered what the surprise would be.
And , as usual , he was very hungry.
But you must not forget that Fatty was greedy.
And greedy people are not thoughtful of others.
When Mrs.
`` Here we are !"
said his mother.
Fatty looked about him.
Fatty grunted.
He was very impolite , you see.
`` Well -- what is there to eat that 's so fine ?"
he asked.
`` This stuff is n't good.
It 's like eating reeds"
He had already bitten into one of the stalks.
`` What do you call that ?"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
`` That 's something like a cattail ,"
said Fatty.
`` It is n't good to eat"
`` Have you ever tried one ?"
asked his mother.
`` N -- no ,"
Patty said.
`` But Freddie Bluejay told me they were n't good"
`` He did , did he ?"
Mrs.
Coon said nothing more.
In a jiffy she had torn it from its stalk.
And then she stripped the green covering off it.
`` Try that !"
said Mrs.
Coon with a smile.
Of course it was Fatty who tasted it first.
`` What 's its name , Mother ?"
he inquired.
`` Corn , my child"
`` Well , why does n't Freddie Bluejay like it ?"
Fatty asked.
`` He 's probably very fond of corn ,"
said Mrs.
Coon.
`` I 'd like to ,"
said Fatty , with a sigh.
`` I 'd like to eat all the corn in the world"
But he did n't think that THAT was much.
Fatty loved to climb trees.
Next to eating , Fatty loved sleeping.
And now he had a good nap.
He was terribly hungry now.
Pretty soon Fatty smiled.
He smiled because he was pleased.
And he began to eat them hungrily.
There was a sudden rush through the branches of the tall tree.
And Fatty Coon caught a hard blow on his head.
He felt something sharp sink into his back , too.
And he was frightened , because his back hurt.
He began to think he would never reach home.
Mrs.
Coon waked up.
`` What on earth is the matter ?"
she exclaimed.
Poor Fatty told her.
`` What color were those eggs ?"
Mrs.
Coon inquired.
`` White !"
said Fatty.
`` Ah , ha !"
Mrs.
Coon said.
And a goshawk is the fiercest of all the hawks there are.
It 's no wonder your back is clawed.
Come here and let me look at it"
He only wished there had been a dozen of them"
For once Fatty Coon was not hungry.
He was strolling homewards through the woods when someone called to him.
It was Jimmy Rabbit.
`` Where are you going , Fatty ?"
Jimmy Rabbit asked.
`` Home !"
said Fatty.
`` Are you hungry ?"
Jimmy Rabbit asked anxiously.
`` I should say not !"
Fatty answered.
`` I 've just had the finest meal I ever ate in my life"
Jimmy Rabbit seemed to be relieved to hear that.
`` Come on over and play ,"
he said.
`` All right !"
said Fatty.
`` What do you need me for ?"
Fatty asked , as he trudged along beside Jimmy Rabbit.
`` We need you for the barber 's pole ,"
Jimmy explained.
Fatty Coon was greatly pleased.
He looked around at his tail and felt very proud.
`` I 've got a beautiful tail -- have n't I ?"
he asked.
`` Um -- yes !"
But come along ! There may be people waiting to get their hair cut"
Squirrel 's head.
`` How much do you charge for a hair-cut ?"
Fatty asked.
`` Oh , that depends !"
Jimmy Rabbit said.
`` Mr.
Squirrel will pay us six cabbage leaves.
We 'd want a dozen cabbage leaves , at least"
Fatty asked.
Jimmy Rabbit and his brother whispered together for a few moments.
`` I 'll tell you what we 'll do ,"
Jimmy said.
Is n't that fair enough ?"
Fatty Coon was satisfied.
But he insisted that Jimmy begin to cut his hair at once.
`` I 'm doing my part of the work now ,"
he pointed out.
`` So there 's no reason why you should n't do yours"
With that Jimmy Rabbit began.
`` Moustache trimmed ?"
Jimmy Rabbit asked , when he had finished with Fatty 's head.
`` Certainly -- of course !"
Fatty Coon answered.
`` You have n't cut it too short , I hope ,"
he said.
`` No , indeed !"
Jimmy Rabbit assured him.
`` It 's the very latest style"
`` What on earth has happened to you ?"
Mrs.
Coon cried , -- when Fatty reached home that night.
`` Have you been in a fire ?"
`` It 's the latest style , Mother ,"
Fatty told her.
`` At least , that 's what Jimmy Rabbit says"
He felt the least bit uneasy again.
`` Did you let that Jimmy Rabbit do that to you ?"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
Fatty hung his head.
He said nothing at all.
But his mother knew.
`` Well ! you ARE a sight !"
she exclaimed.
`` It will be months before you look like my child again.
I shall be ashamed to go anywhere with you"
Fatty Coon felt very foolish.
And there was just one thing that kept him from crying.
They kept out of sight.
He felt very silly.
And he wished that he might meet Jimmy Rabbit and his brother"
The winter was fast going.
Fatty was much thinner than he had been in the fall.
And now he hardly knew himself as he looked at his sides.
They no longer stuck out as they had once.
The ground was covered with snow.
And looking at those tracks only made him hungrier than ever.
For a few minutes Fatty thought deeply.
And he stopped right there.
He had gone far enough.
The door was open a little way.
There was a long row of hams hung up in a line.
The hams were what Fatty Coon had smelled.
And the hams were what Fatty intended to eat.
Fatty did not stop to look long at that row of hams.
He stopped at the very first ham he came to.
There was no sense in going any further.
Fatty could not eat fast enough.
He wished he had two mouths -- he was so hungry.
But he did very well , with only ONE.
And he had no idea of stopping.
But he did stop.
He stopped very suddenly.
But he was terribly frightened.
And he never stopped running until he was almost home.
He was puzzled.
`` It was some sort of trap , probably ,"
Mrs.
Coon said.
But for once Mrs.
Coon was mistaken.
It was very simple.
Fatty 's children thought it very exciting.
It was their favorite story.
And they made their father tell it over and over again"
Somehow , he felt safer on the ground.
He wished he might find a frog.
But not one frog appeared.
And then he forgot all about frogs.
Yes ! Frogs passed completely out of Fatty Coon 's mind.
For whom should he spy but Mrs.
She was swimming toward the bank where Fatty was hidden.
Mrs.
First she dug a hole in the sand.
And Fatty wondered what she was looking for.
But he kept very quiet.
And after a time Mrs.
Turtle splashed into the creek again and paddled away.
She seemed to have a secret.
Fatty Coon had grown very curious , as he watched Mrs.
Turtle.
He went straight to the spot where Mrs.
Turtle had dug the hole and filled it up again.
Turtle had dug before him.
It took Fatty Coon only about six seconds to discover Mrs.
Turtle 's secret.
Turtle had left there in the warm sand to hatch.
THAT was why she seemed so pleased.
For Mrs.
But it never happened that way at all.
They were delicious.
`` Be quiet , my child ,"
said the old woman , `` and thou shalt have it.
`` But ,"
Then she hurried away with her lover.
Then the witch cried , `` Where art thou ?"
`` Here , on the stairs , I am sweeping ,"
answered the first drop of blood.
`` Here in the kitchen , I am warming myself ,"
cried the second drop of blood.
She went into the kitchen , but found no one.
Then she cried again , `` Where art thou ?"
`` Ah , here in the bed , I am sleeping"
cried the third drop of blood.
She went into the room to the bed.
`` That shall not serve you ,"
`` Oh , yes ,"
he replied , `` I will play to you while you do it"
`` Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait for thee ,"
The man said , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am God"
`` Then I do not desire to have thee for a godfather ,"
He turned therefore away from the Lord , and went farther.
The man asked , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am the Devil"
`` Then I do not desire to have thee for godfather ,"
said the man ; `` thou deceivest men and leadest them astray"
The man asked , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am person_0 , and I make all equal"
I make thee a celebrated physician.
`` If I could but cheat person_0 for once ,"
Soon afterwards the King 's daughter fell into a severe illness.
`` See ,"
said person_0 , `` these are the lights of men 's lives.
`` Show me the light of my life ,"
`` Ah , dear godfather ,"
`` I can not ,"
answered person_0 , `` one must go out before a new one is lighted"
pleaded the physician.
There was once upon a time a King who had no children.
But the Fakir said , `` Who are you , man ?"
The King replied , `` I am a King , Fakir.
`` Whatever you ask , Fakir ,"
answered the King.
The King took the sweetmeats and put them in his bosom.
The King said , `` Well , I agree"
After some time two sons were born to the King.
Then the King went and brought his own sons.
But the King 's son said , `` Master first , and pupil after"
Next he let out all the men who were in prison.
Come , I will fight you"
I appoint the tiger as guard over my property.
`` Good ,"
said her father.
He went in and sat down.
Then the people said , `` The slave-girl has made a mistake"
People said , `` What is this Fakir that he should go a-hunting ?"
Instantly they killed and brought in a great number.
Now that King had no son.
`` Good-day , Father Hollenthe"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your daughter ?"
`` Where is Mother Malcho , then ?"
`` She is in the cow-house , milking the cow"
`` Good-day , Mother Malcho"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your daughter ?"
`` Where is Brother High-and-Mighty , then ?"
`` He is in the room chopping some wood"
`` Good-day , Brother High-and-Mighty"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your sister ?"
`` Where is Sister K setraut , then ?"
`` She is in the garden cutting cabbages"
`` Good-day , sister K setraut"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your sister ?"
`` Where is fair Katrinelje , then ?"
`` She is in the room counting out her farthings"
`` Good day , fair Katrinelje"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` Wilt thou be my bride ?"
`` Fair Katrinelje , how much dowry do hast thou ?"
`` Something better"
`` A shoemaker ?"
`` Something better"
`` A husbandman ?"
`` Something better"
`` A joiner ?"
`` Something better"
`` A smith ?"
`` Something better"
`` A miller ?"
`` Something better"
`` Perhaps a broom-maker ?"
And they let the poor old man know what they felt.
`` Look here , friend ,"
said he.
You will soon find them change their conduct towards you.
Salaam.
I will come again soon to see how you are getting on"
`` Dear gentlemen ,"
`` How can that be ,"
Old Rhyme.
`` Come in good time , my dear Duchess ,"
wrote Ribby.
But it is very strange.
`` I will come very punctually , my dear Ribby ,"
and changed it to `` I hope it will be fine ,"
and she gave her letter to the postman.
`` I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse !"
And MY pie was going to be veal and ham.
Crowns , jewels , palaces , appeared as naught.
'Twas solely beauteous woman now he sought.
person_0.
person_0ill I will give you something"
person_0.
person_0.
person_0.
When he had had it , he journeyed onwards , and then person_0.
`` Where am I to procure it ?"
`` No ,"
answered person_0.
Peter , `` we need not quite do that.
`` Indeed ,"
`` Just come with me ,"
said person_0.
`` All right ,"
said Brother Lustig , so they went away together.
`` person_0op that howling and crying ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` I will make the man well again ,"
But person_0.
Brother Lustig , however , nudged person_0.
At length the woman brought a lamb and said to person_0.
Peter that he really must take that , but he would not.
Then person_0.
`` That is nothing ,"
said Brother Lustig.
`` I will easily carry it ,"
and took it on his shoulder.
`` As you like ,"
answered person_0.
`` Well , go , then ,"
said Brother Lustig , `` I understand cookery , I will manage it"
Then person_0.
`` That is said to be the best part ,"
At length person_0.
`` But where can it be ?"
said the apostle.
`` I do n't know ,"
`` Oh ,"
said person_0.
`` No , be assured , my brother ,"
`` Well , it is all right ,"
said person_0.
They went farther , and then person_0.
Said person_0.
Peter , `` Do thou go first"
`` No ,"
answered Brother Lustig , `` thou must go first ,"
Then person_0.
Then he cried , `` Brother , help me !"
person_0.
`` No ,"
said he , `` I have not eaten it"
Then the water grew deeper still and rose to his mouth.
`` Help me , brother ,"
cried the soldier.
person_0.
`` No ,"
he replied , `` I have not eaten it"
person_0.
`` Hollo , brother !"
said the soldier to person_0.
But person_0.
said he , `` that we may get there in time"
But person_0.
`` Now we are done for !"
said Brother Lustig ; `` that comes of thy sleepy way of walking !"
`` Just be quiet ,"
answered person_0.
`` Well , if thou canst do that ,"
Peter told the King that he would restore his daughter to life.
Then the King was in the greatest joy , and said to person_0.
But person_0.
Peter said , `` I want nothing for it"
`` Oh , thou tomfool !"
person_0.
Peter said to Brother Lustig , `` Now , we will divide the gold"
`` Yes ,"
he replied , `` we will"
So person_0.
Peter divided the gold , and divided it into three heaps.
But person_0.
`` Oh , I ate that !"
replied Brother Lustig , and hastily swept up the gold.
`` You may trust what I say"
`` But how can that be true ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` when a lamb has no heart ?"
`` Well , so be it ,"
said person_0.
`` As you like , dear brother ,"
answered Brother Lustig.
`` Farewell"
Then person_0.
`` Oh , ho !"
Peter do.
and he said this thrice , but the bones did not stir.
When he had said that , person_0.
he answered.
Thereupon person_0.
and the King 's daughter arose , healthy and beautiful as before.
Then person_0.
`` I should just like to know ,"
When he got out , person_0.
`` How can I help that ,"
answered Brother Lustig , `` if people will put it in for me ?"
`` Faith ,"
said person_0.
Farewell , thou wilt now never see me more"
`` Good-bye ,"
`` Ah , that 's right !"
said he , `` now I am a made man !"
and went away to a meadow and took out the roast meat.
Brother Lustig thought to himself , `` One is enough for me ,"
I looked after him myself ; you are the thieves and shall pay !"
said Brother Lustig.
`` Ah , indeed ,"
`` If others have tried it ,"
said Brother Lustig , `` I will try it too"
`` Leave it alone ,"
said the host , `` it will cost you your neck"
`` It wo n't kill me at once ,"
`` person_0op , you devils ' ghosts ,"
said he , but they behaved still worse.
`` Devils ' crew ,"
cried he , `` it is getting too bad , but wait.
Into my knapsack , all nine of you !"
`` The reason why they have not ,"
`` No ,"
`` I should be a fool ,"
He once gave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it"
person_0.
Peter was sitting hard by as door-keeper.
But person_0.
Peter said , `` I really believe that thou wantest to come into Heaven"
`` No ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` thou shalt not enter"
`` Give it here , then ,"
said person_0.
Peter.
Peter took it , and hung it beside his seat.
Peter was forced to let him stay there"
Here , boys , go on , go on !"
And they began to treat the poor tortoise more cruelly than ever.
`` No , we wo n't give you the tortoise ,"
said one of the boys.
`` Why should we ? We caught it ourselves"
`` What you say is true ,"
Wo n't that do for you , my boys ?"
See what good boys you are to listen to me"
as they say in Japan.
The next morning person_0 went out as usual in his boat.
`` Well , Mr.
Tortoise ,"
said person_0 , `` was it you who called my name just now ?"
`` Indeed ,"
said person_0 , `` that is very polite of you.
Come up into the boat.
and the fisherman laughed at the joke.
`` He-he-he-he !"
`` Indeed ,"
said person_0 , `` I regret very much that I have no `` sake"
It must be very far away , if it exists at all !"
`` But ,"
`` It may seem absurd to you.
but I assure you that you can do so.
`` This is strange indeed !"
said person_0 ; `` then.
Mr.
Tortoise , with your kind permission I will get on your back.
Dokoisho !"
-LRB- Footnote : `` All right"
-LRB- only used by lower classes -RRB-.
-RRB- he exclaimed as he jumped on.
Down through the water the tortoise dived.
For a long time these two strange companions rode through the sea.
person_0 never grew tired , nor his clothes moist with the water.
`` Ya"
exclaimed person_0.
Tortoise , can you tell what that place is we can now see ?"
said person_0.
`` Yes , indeed ,"
And while he was speaking the tortoise reached the side of the gate.
`` And here we are , and you must please walk from here"
Please show him the way"
Thrice welcome are you , having come from such a distant country.
And you , Mr.
and from here the whole band of fishes became his guides.
said the Princess.
Beyond all words , this is the most wonderful place I have ever seen"
person_0 enjoyed himself with all his heart.
I must go back at once without letting one more day pass"
And he began to prepare for the journey in great haste.
But now I must say good-by.
I must go back to my old parents"
Do not think that I wish to leave you.
It is not that.
I must go and see my old parents.
Let me go for one day and I will come back to you"
`` Then ,"
said the Princess sorrowfully , `` there is nothing to be done.
and then he added : `` Tell me what is this box ?"
`` That ,"
Wondering what it can mean he walks quickly towards his old home.
was the fisherman 's thought.
`` Excuse me ,"
My name is person_0 Taro.
Where have my parents gone whom I left here ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the fisherman , `` I am person_0 Taro !"
`` Ha , ha !"
laughed the man , `` you must not make such jokes.
He could not possibly be alive now !"
Till four or five days ago I lived on this spot.
Tell me what I want to know without more joking , please"
Perhaps you are his spirit come to revisit your old home ?"
`` Why do you mock me ?"
said person_0.
and `` don-don ,"
-LRB- Japanese ghosts have no feet.
person_0 was lost in bewilderment and trouble.
He seemed to be in a strange dream.
There was no use in staying here any longer.
He must get back to his beautiful wife beyond the sea.
There is nothing else for me to do now.
Yes , yes , I will open the box and look in !"
`` Well ,"
I have certainly money enough"
He entered the house , and was well received and courteously entertained.
I must and will have it !"
The huntsman asked , `` Why dost thou stand there so sorrowfully ?"
`` Ah , my beloved ,"
`` Hast thou nothing else to complain of ?"
said the huntsman.
`` I will soon remove that burden from thy heart"
The second said , `` Step upon him and kill him"
So saying they passed by.
Then the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue.
said he , `` that I can go no further"
`` Why not ?"
and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad cabbage.
The huntsman thought , `` The salad must have already taken effect ,"
and said , `` I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it"
`` All right ,"
said he , `` the two have taken their portion ,"
`` I bring you the delicate food myself ,"
said he , `` in order that you may not have to wait longer"
`` I have three unmanageable beasts ,"
answered he , `` which I do n't want to keep any longer.
So the wedding was celebrated , and they lived happily together until their death"
The boy was called Hansel and the girl Grethel.
`` I 'll tell you what , husband ,"
`` No , wife ,"
`` O , thou fool !"
and she left him no peace until he consented.
said the man.
`` Be quiet , Grethel ,"
and he lay down again in his bed.
Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.
`` Ah , father ,"
Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood together , as high as a little hill.
When we have done , we will come back and fetch you away"
When at last they awoke , it was already dark night.
`` Hansel , why dost thou stop and look round ?"
said the father , `` go on"
answered Hansel.
`` Simpleton !"
Hansel said to Grethel , `` We shall soon find the way ,"
but they did not find it.
`` We will set to work on that ,"
said Hansel , `` and have a good meal.
and went on eating without disturbing themselves.
No harm shall happen to you"
He might scream as he liked , that was of no use.
When he is fat , I will eat him"
`` Hola , Grethel ,"
she cried.
`` Just keep thy noise to thyself ,"
said the old woman , `` all that wo n't help thee at all"
`` We will bake first ,"
`` Creep in ,"
`` Silly goose ,"
and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven.
`` These are far better than pebbles !"
and filled her pinafore full.
`` But now we will go away"
said Hansel , `` that we may get out of the witch 's forest"
`` We can not get over ,"
said Hansel , `` I see no foot-plank , and no bridge"
`` And no boat crosses either ,"
`` No ,"
`` Who are you , and what do you want ?"
asked the man in a grumbling voice.
`` I am a poor tailor ,"
`` Go your way ,"
His courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order.
`` Just Heaven !"
`` I at once suspected nothing good.
Instead of answering me , he began to laugh loudly.
I answered him as little as I had done the first time.
Help me to accomplish the other things which happened in those visions.
for he was afraid.
thought he.
`` That , too , must be an art of which I understand nothing"
Look how thy brother works , but thou dost not even earn thy salt"
`` Well , father ,"
I do n't understand that at all yet"
He who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes"
`` Just think ,"
`` If that be all ,"
replied the sexton , `` he can learn that with me.
Send him to me , and I will soon polish him"
`` Thou shalt soon learn what shuddering is ,"
`` Who is there ?"
`` Give an answer ,"
uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone.
`` No , I do n't know ,"
I should be sorry if it were"
`` Your boy ,"
Take the good-for-nothing fellow away from our house"
The father was terrified , and ran thither and scolded the boy.
`` What wicked tricks are these ?"
said he , `` the devil must have put this into thy head"
`` Father ,"
he replied , `` do listen to me.
I am quite innocent.
`` Ah ,"
said the father , `` I have nothing but unhappiness with you.
Go out of my sight.
I will see thee no more"
`` Learn what thou wilt ,"
spake the father , `` it is all the same to me.
Here are fifty thalers for thee.
`` Yes , father , it shall be as you will.
`` If that is all that is wanted ,"
Just come back to me early in the morning"
and he hung them up again each in his turn.
`` No ,"
`` I do n't know ,"
answered the youth.
Then the waggoner asked , `` From whence comest thou ?"
`` I know not"
`` Who is thy father ?"
`` That I may not tell thee"
`` What is it that thou art always muttering between thy teeth"
`` Ah ,"
`` Give up thy foolish chatter ,"
said the waggoner.
`` Ah , be silent ,"
`` Ah , if I could but shudder !"
said he , `` but I shall not learn it here either"
`` You simpletons !"
`` Why not ?"
he replied , `` but just show me your paws"
Then they stretched out their claws.
`` Oh ,"
`` I have looked at your fingers ,"
said he , `` and my fancy for card-playing has gone ,"
and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water.
and began to cut them down.
Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner.
`` That is the very thing for me ,"
said he , and got into it.
`` That 's right ,"
said he , `` but go faster"
and lay down by his fire , and slept till it was day.
`` Very well indeed ,"
`` No ,"
said he , `` it is all in vain.
If some one would but tell me"
`` Hollo !"
cried he , `` another half belongs to this.
This is too little !"
`` Wait ,"
`` That is no part of our bargain ,"
said the youth , `` the bench is mine"
`` Yes , if thou hast any money"
`` Money enough ,"
replied he , `` but your balls are not quite round"
`` There , now , they will roll better !"
said he.
`` Hurrah ! Now it goes merrily !"
He lay down and quietly fell asleep.
Next morning the King came to inquire after him.
`` How has it fared with you this time ?"
asked he.
`` I have been playing at nine-pins ,"
he answered , `` and have lost a couple of farthings"
`` Hast thou not shuddered then ?"
`` Eh , what ?"
said he , `` I have made merry.
If I did but know what it was to shudder !"
He felt his face , but it was cold as ice.
`` Stop ,"
said he , `` I will warm thee a little ,"
`` What !"
Then came the six men and carried him away again.
`` I can not manage to shudder ,"
said he.
`` I shall never learn it here as long as I live"
He was old , however , and had a long white beard.
`` Thou wretch ,"
`` Not so fast ,"
replied the youth.
`` I will soon seize thee ,"
said the fiend.
`` Softly , softly , do not talk so big.
I am as strong as thou art , and perhaps even stronger"
`` We shall see ,"
said the old man.
`` I can do better than that ,"
said the youth , and went to the other anvil.
`` Now I have thee ,"
said the youth.
`` Now it is thou who will have to die"
The youth drew out the axe and let him go.
`` Of these ,"
`` I shall still be able to find my way out ,"
`` No ,"
`` Then ,"
`` That is all very well ,"
And at last she was angry at this.
\* By this character La Fontaine is supposed to have meant his own wife"

ONE day , to William 's castle as he moved.
Yes , Reynold answered.
MEANWHILE , however , while thus the lady sought.
If any one met her , she greeted him quite courteously.
`` Good day , dear countryman , it is a fine day.
She has claws beneath her gloves ; she is a witch"
One morning , a handsome young man was going through the forest.
`` But , good little mother ,"
said he , `` how canst thou carry all that away ?"
`` I must carry it , dear sir ,"
`` Will you help me ?"
she said , as he remained standing by her.
How soon you would bound up thither"
The young man took compassion on the old woman.
`` My father is certainly no peasant ,"
`` If you will try it ,"
said she , `` I shall be very glad.
`` See , it is quite light ,"
said she.
`` No , it is not light ,"
answered the count , and pulled a rueful face.
`` Just look ,"
Why are you standing loitering there ?"
she continued.
`` Step out.
No one will take the bundle off again"
`` Dame ,"
said he , `` I can go no farther.
I want to rest a little"
`` Not here ,"
Who knows what good it may do you ?"
`` Old woman , thou art becoming shameless !"
`` Do n't get angry , dear sir ,"
I will give you a good present when we get home"
`` Good mother ,"
`` By no means , my dear daughter ,"
You have fairly earned your wages , and they shall not be wanting"
The count knew not whether to laugh or to cry.
`` Such a sweetheart as that ,"
The youth lay down on the bench , under a wild apple-tree.
`` It is quite delightful here ,"
`` Sit up ,"
`` Take great care of it ,"
said she , `` it will bring thee good fortune"
She bade him rise and hand her the little book.
Each of them said she loved him best.
`` Can you not express to me ,"
The eldest spoke.
`` I love my father as dearly as the sweetest sugar"
The second , `` I love my father as dearly as my prettiest dress"
But the youngest was silent.
`` I do not know , and can compare my love with nothing"
But her father insisted that she should name something.
You must tell me how you came by that pearl"
The King and the Queen resolved to seek out the old woman.
Soon afterwards the daughter also entered.
It was an old night-owl , which cried , `` Uhu !"
three times.
But the fair maiden was sad.
She sat down and wept bitterly.
She ran back home , trembling like an aspen-leaf.
She led her into the room and lighted a new log.
she said to the girl.
`` But , mother ,"
`` Dost thou know then what time it is ?"
asked the old woman.
`` Not yet midnight ,"
answered the maiden , `` but already past eleven o'clock"
`` Dost thou not remember ,"
The old woman would not tell the maiden what lay before her.
`` My stay here is over ,"
`` But tell me what is about to happen ,"
the maiden continued to entreat.
`` Oho ,"
Their daughter , however , they did not see.
`` She needs nothing ,"
said the old woman.
When the old woman had said that , she disappeared from their sight.
That does not happen now-a-days , or else the poor would soon become rich"
Shall we travel together ?"
`` All right ,"
`` That is just where I want to go ,"
answered the shoemaker.
`` What !"
It was as quiet there as in a church.
In short he was pitiless.
`` Eat what one can , and suffer what one must"
When day dawned he awoke , but knew not where he lay.
`` Yes , I am awake ,"
answered the second.
`` Then I will tell thee something ,"
The foal , however , begged to be set free.
`` I am still too young ,"
A time may perhaps come when I may reward thee for it"
`` Run off ,"
said the tailor , `` I see thou art still a giddy thing"
But the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before.
`` The sun to be sure fills my eyes ,"
said he , `` but the bread does not fill my mouth.
In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow towards him.
`` Halt , halt !"
cried the tailor , and seized him by the leg.
I must cut thy head off , and roast thee"
`` Do n't do that ,"
`` Well , be off , Cousin Longlegs ,"
said the tailor.
`` What 's to be the end of this ?"
Whatsoever comes in my way now is lost"
`` You come just at the right moment ,"
`` Canst thou not imagine ,"
`` Only be quiet ,"
said the good-tempered tailor , `` thou shalt keep thy children ,"
and put the prisoner back into the water.
`` There I shall at once find the reward of my good deed ,"
said the tailor , `` the honey will refresh me"
The little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done.
`` Three dishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner !"
When he was satisfied he said , `` Now I will get to work"
`` I can go no further in skill ,"
said he , `` and yet things improve every day"
At last the King appointed him court-tailor.
`` Before he takes revenge on me ,"
thought he to himself , `` I must dig a pit for him"
`` That would please me very much ,"
`` Oho !"
thought the tailor , `` a rogue gives more than he has got.
replied the tailor , and told her his fate.
`` If that be all ,"
said the duck , `` we can help thee.
In the meantime just spread out thy handkerchief on the bank"
They swam to the shore and put the crown on the handkerchief.
and threw his bundle on his back , and went forth.
answered the tailor , `` something quite different weighs me down ,"
and he told her what the King had demanded of him.
`` The time has come ,"
But good fortune did not last long.
`` The reward is indeed great ,"
`` It ca n't be managed ,"
He tied up his bundle and hurried away to the gate.
The stork came to him and greeted him.
`` I see ,"
he began , `` that thou hast thy pack on thy back.
Why art thou leaving the town ?"
`` Do n't let thy hair grow gray about that ,"
said the stork , `` I will help thee out of thy difficulty.
Go home and be easy.
`` It seems to me ,"
said he , `` just as if I had won the highest prize.
The road to the forest led him to the gallows.
`` If you want to know ,"
said the mother , `` seek it for yourself ,"
and instantly she was white and fair as day.
That also was granted unto her , and then the Lord left her.
`` Be quiet ,"
said the old woman , `` I will soon divert it to you ,"
The bride asked , `` What is my dear brother saying ?"
`` Ah ,"
The bride asked , `` What is my dear brother saying ?"
`` Ah ,"
And they drove on farther.
The bride asked , `` What is my dear brother saying ?"
`` Ah ,"
The kitchen-boy did it , and lighted a fire on the hearth.
The boy answered , `` She is loved by the King and happy"
`` May God have mercy on him ,"
said the duck , and swam forth by the sink.
All of which was done to her , and to her black daughter.
he replied.
Then the other said , `` Come with me , and be a thief"
`` No ,"
`` Oh ,"
`` I do n't know yet ,"
he replied.
`` Would you not like to be a tailor ?"
said he.
`` Not that I know of ,"
`` Oh , but you are speaking in ignorance ,"
`` So now ,"
`` Now it 's your turn ,"
The tailor brought his needle , and sewed them as his father wished.
`` Well ,"
I ca n't say which of you deserves the most praise.
and resolved to go forth together and liberate the King 's daughter.
`` I will soon know where she is ,"
`` Then I will try my art ,"
A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow 's nest.
Little birds have to encounter great dangers !"
`` Ah , my son ,"
said the son.
`` Where hast thou seen that ?"
`` In a merchant 's garden ,"
said the youngster.
`` Oh , my son , merchant folks are quick folks ,"
said the father.
`` At court ,"
said the son.
`` Yes , father ,"
`` Where hast thou seen that ?"
said the old bird.
`` At court , among the stable-boys"
`` That is indeed dainty fare ,"
`` That is true ,"
`` Where hast thou seen that ?"
`` Mountain folks are working folks , and clever folks.
`` Where hast thou learned this ?"
`` There ,"
he thought , `` I can surely be town-musician"
`` What are you gasping so for , you big fellow ?"
asked the donkey.
`` Ah ,"
`` I tell you what ,"
I will play the lute , and you shall beat the kettledrum"
The hound agreed , and on they went.
asked the donkey.
`` Who can be merry when his neck is in danger ?"
answered the cat.
But now good advice is scarce.
Where am I to go ?"
`` Go with us to Bremen.
You understand night-music , you can be a town-musician"
The cat thought well of it , and went with them.
`` Your crow goes through and through one ,"
said the donkey.
`` What is the matter ?"
Now I am crowing at full pitch while I can"
`` Ah , but red-comb ,"
said the donkey , `` you had better come away with us.
The cock agreed to this plan , and all four went on together.
`` What do you see , my grey-horse ?"
asked the cock.
`` What do I see ?"
`` That would be the sort of thing for us ,"
said the cock.
`` Yes , yes ; ah , how I wish we were there !"
said the donkey.
and ordered one of them to go and examine the house.
And the mouth of him who last told this story is still warm"
YE beauteous dames avoid the Sylvan shade ; Dread dangers solitary woods pervade"
`` Alas , thou canst not help me"
`` I well know your desire ,"
said the cat.
`` You wish to have a beautiful horse.
`` Well , this is a wonderful cat !"
They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs , and were merry and happy.
`` No ,"
said he , `` I wo n't dance with a pussy cat.
I have never done that yet"
`` Then take him to bed ,"
said she to the cats.
`` That feels very soft !"
said Hans.
`` No ,"
said Hans.
They asked Hans where his horse was.
`` It will follow me in three days ' time"
`` It will be a fine one !"
Then the King 's daughter said that they were to bring him immediately.
`` And that is for the third miller 's boy ,"
said she.
`` Then he must have the mill ,"
First Story.
Then the snake came in haste , and enjoyed its food.
From that time forth , a change came over the child.
Second Story.
Third Story.
A snake cries , `` Huhu , huhu"
A child says , `` Come out"
The snake says , `` No"
`` Neither have I"
`` Then I am like you.
Huhu , huhu , huhu"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the doctor , `` that is soon managed"
`` What must I do ?"
asked the peasant.
and have that nailed up above thy house-door"
The peasant did everything that he had been told to do.
`` Oh , yes , but Grethe , my wife , must go too"
`` Yes , but my wife , Grethe , too ,"
said he , and he seated himself with her at the table.
meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish.
This servant was just as much alarmed , and he got out.
They led him to the spot where the money was concealed.
Then Dr.
He asked them , `` Where does the godfather live ?"
The broom replied , `` One flight of stairs higher up"
He asked , `` Where does the godfather live ?"
One of the fingers replied , `` One flight of stairs higher"
They , too , said , `` One flight of stairs higher"
`` How stupid you are !"
said the godfather.
`` That was the boy and the maid talking to each other"
`` But on the second flight I saw dead fingers lying"
`` Oh , how silly you are ! Those were some roots of scorzonera"
`` On the third flight lay a heap of dead men 's heads"
`` Foolish man , those were cabbages"
When he had said that , the fishes came and served themselves up.
`` Oh , that is a lie !"
I should like to learn that , too"
`` It is soon learned ,"
`` Oh , musician ,"
`` Look ,"
`` Stay there until I come back again ,"
said the musician , and went his way.
and took his fiddle and again played in the forest.
`` Ah , there 's a fox coming !"
said the musician.
`` I have no desire for him"
`` That is soon learned ,"
said the musician.
`` Thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee"
`` Oh , musician ,"
`` Follow me ,"
`` Little fox ,"
said he , `` now reach me thy right paw"
and he tied it to the right bough.
`` Wait there till I come back again ,"
said the musician , and went his way.
so he took his fiddle , and the sound echoed through the forest.
Then a little hare came springing towards him.
`` Why , a hare is coming ,"
said the musician , `` I do not want him"
`` Ah , dear musician ,"
`` That is soon learned ,"
`` Oh , musician ,"
`` Now briskly , little hare , run twenty times round the tree !"
`` Wait there till I come back ,"
said the musician , and went onwards.
`` At last comes the right companion ,"
Then the beasts were terrified and ran back into the forest.
`` If that be true ,"
said the man , `` then I can well do you a favor"
`` Yes ,"
`` Yes ,"
`` There is no need of your knowing ,"
and they sat down , and ate and drank together.
`` Alas ,"
`` Very good ,"
`` Listen ,"
`` I will take good care ,"
answered the fisherman , and threw the fish back into the water.
`` Now you have got what you want ,"
said he ; `` and we can gnaw at a bare bone again"
`` Ah ,"
`` Listen ,"
It came to pass , however , that from the two pieces that were"
`` Oh yes ,"
`` Then ,"
A royal proclamation was issued to this effect.
They came to see the tamasha.
`` My own son and the son of my chief vizier !"
exclaimed the king , who had been present from the commencement.
`` What examples for the people ! Let them both be executed"
`` Not so , your Majesty ,"
How is it ?"
he continued , turning to the two young men.
`` Why have you done this cruel thing ?"
answered the prince.
`` I suppose the arrow struck the merchant 's wife.
`` We will speak of this later on ,"
said the king , on hearing this answer.
`` Dismiss the people.
Their presence is no longer needed"
This was finally agreed to.
`` I am come ,"
Turn me not back , if you love me"
`` Consider ,"
the prince answered , `` what you are doing.
All kinds of trial may be before me.
Why should you leave your home and country to be with me ?"
`` Because I love you ,"
he said , `` and shall never be happy without you"
There he came across the footmarks of his friend.
`` Alas ! alas !"
Speak , speak ! I can not bear this !"
`` Thank God !"
exclaimed the vizier 's son.
`` But what is the matter , brother ?"
`` Go away ,"
replied the prince.
Go away"
`` Come , come ; let us leave this place.
Let us eat and depart"
`` Go alone ,"
replied the prince.
`` Never ,"
said the vizier 's son.
`` I have looked upon a fairy ,"
the prince said.
Then I fainted.
`` Oh , brother ,"
said the vizier 's son , `` you have indeed seen a fairy.
She is a fairy of the fairies.
This is none other than person_0 of the Ivory City.
I know this from the signs that she gave you.
Be patient , and rest assured that I will arrange your marriage with her"
On the way they met two men.
These two men belonged to a family of robbers.
There were eleven of them altogether.
`` It is late ,"
they said , `` and there is not another village within several miles"
`` Shall we accept this good man 's invitation , brother ?"
asked the prince.
It is very kind of you to ask us"
So they all four went to the robbers ' tower.
`` It is no good groaning ,"
said the vizier 's son.
Yes ! yes !"
he whispered , when he had reached the window-hole.
`` Below there is a ditch surrounded by a high wall.
I will jump down and reconnoitre.
You stay here , and wait till I return"
`` But where are the horses and the goods ?"
the vizier 's son inquired.
`` You can not bring them ,"
the woman said.
I have a charm , whereby I can make them thin or fat"
She agreed to let them stay there for a few days.
`` Has this city a name ?"
he asked the old woman.
`` Of course it has , you stupid.
`` What is the name of this city ?"
`` Ivory City.
`` Is there a king of this country ?"
continued the vizier 's son.
`` Of course there is , and a queen , and a princess"
`` What are their names ?"
`` Yes ,"
he said to him afterwards , `` we are in the right country.
We shall see the beautiful princess"
`` Who is coming ?"
said the vizier 's son.
`` Nobody ,"
the old woman replied.
`` Then where are you going ?"
I see her and the princess every day.
On seeing her mother the girl pretended to be very angry.
`` Why have you not been for two days ?"
she asked.
`` Because , my dear ,"
I ca n't understand the men ,"
she added ; `` one of them especially appears very stupid.
They each give me a muhr every morning and every evening"
`` Alas ! alas !"
said the prince , who had eagerly listened to every word.
`` Anger ?"
said the vizier 's son , with an astonished air.
`` She would be exceedingly glad to see one man.
I know this.
`` Heaven be praised !"
the prince exclaimed.
`` Get the swing ,"
she said to one of the servants standing by.
`` Oh !"
The royal elephants have got loose and are running about wildly.
When I heard this I was anxious about you.
So the princess gave me this charmed swing to return in.
`` Do n't believe this ,"
said the vizier 's son.
`` It is a mere hoax.
They have been playing tricks with you"
`` You will soon have your heart 's desire ,"
he whispered aside to the prince.
`` These things are signs"
Oh , what a happy meeting it was ! `` At last ,"
said person_0 , `` I have seen my beloved , my husband"
`` A thousand thanks to Heaven for bringing me to you ,"
said the prince.
One morning person_0 begged him to stay with her always.
She could not live without seeing him.
Accordingly he sent back his salam and expressions of thankfulness.
`` Heaven be praised ,"
`` Is it because I am away so much at the palace ?"
`` Look here ,"
It is saturated with poison.
Thank Heaven , I discovered it in time !"
`` The Princess person_0.
Listen.
This done , return.
`` It is well ,"
said the vizier 's son , when he heard of this proclamation.
The prince took it to a goldsmith and asked him to buy it.
`` How much do you want for it ?"
asked the man.
`` Fifty thousand rupees ,"
the prince replied.
`` All right ,"
said the man ; `` wait here while I go and fetch the money"
`` How did you get the necklace ?"
the kotwal asked.
the prince replied.
`` Permit me , and I will show you where he is"
`` Call the king hither ,"
he replied , `` and then I will tell his Majesty face to face"
`` Last night ,"
While running away from me her necklace got loose and dropped.
`` It is so ,"
said the maid-servant ; `` the burn is there"
`` Then let the girl be slain immediately ,"
the king shouted.
`` No , no , your Majesty ,"
they replied.
The king agreed , and so the princess was taken to the graveyard.
said the fakir.
When the vizier read the letter he went and informed the king.
`` Come ,"
He agreed to do so , and succeeded in obtaining their pardon.
Henceforth all was sunshine on the path of the prince.
The region round the little town of Kjoege is very bleak and bare.
`` On the shop-board ,"
said the baker in conclusion.
And there they are for you !"
`` She has a very sweet voice , that little girl ,"
they said.
Those were glorious days , but they could not last for ever.
The neighbors were neighbors no longer.
Next Sunday he was to pay a visit to Joanna 's father.
`` Joanna will be glad to see you ,"
said the father : `` you have grown quite a nice young man.
You shall see her presently.
She has her own room now , and pays us rent for it"
In all Kjoege there was not a girl like her.
No , she had not grown proud at all.
Yes , certainly she was fond of Knud.
`` He is only a young fellow ,"
he said.
Nothing comes of silent love : I have learned that from the cakes"
Even the king smiled at Joanna , and seemed to delight in her.
So soon as Sunday came , he went again.
He felt as if he were going into a church.
`` It is well that you are come ,"
she said.
`` You honest , faithful soul !"
she exclaimed ; and these words of hers loosened Knud 's tongue.
And she drew her white hand over his hot forehead.
`` Heaven gives us strength for much ,"
she said , `` if we only endeavor to do our best"
Come , be a man ,"
`` You are a child ,"
And then they parted.
And they went with him to the dancing-rooms.
The winter came , and the streams were frozen.
Everything seemed to be preparing for a burial.
The streets seem to stretch themselves along just as they please.
The houses do not like standing in regular ranks.
His spirit became prayerful , and peace returned to his soul.
Yes , he had certainly gone from the `` Elder-mother"
to the `` Willow-father"
Nevertheless , he could not remain.
And thus it stood with him.
sighed he , `` that the Last Day were come !"
`` Yes , yes , her name is Joanna ,"
Then Knud went home and packed his knapsack.
He felt he was ill.
.
It was thawing ; there was rain in the valley.
It was evening.
He was walking on the public high-road.
By the road-side grew a great willow tree.
to him.
`` We thank you ,"
they said to Knud.
`` Our master first ,"
`` That was the most delicious hour of my life !"
he said , `` and it was but a dream.
Oh , let me dream again !"
And he closed his eyes once more , and slept and dreamed.
Towards morning there was a great fall of snow.
The wind drifted the snow over him , but he slept on.
He was dead -- frozen to death under the willow tree !"
Some years have elapsed since the time of which we speak.

The water-lilies rocked themselves on the river.
`` Take me with you !"
she cried.
`` Follow me !"
he cried.
`` Yonder lies the house"
But the house was not yonder.
Soon they heard a loud piercing scream.
Now again they heard the cry they had heard before.
`` We shall get into trouble about the pig ,"
said person_0.
`` Come , let us go to our house ,"
said person_1 ; `` it is here in the wood"

At last they both lost themselves in a thicket.
The sun was high in the heavens when the two children awoke.
But there was another surprise and another fright in store for them.
She was a gipsy.
The children did not at once understand what she said.
And person_1 and person_0 looked at the wishing-nuts with great eyes.
`` Is there a carriage with a pair of horses in this nut ?"
he asked.
`` Yes , there 's a golden carriage with two horses ,"
answered the woman.
`` Then give me the nut ,"
said little person_0.
inquired person_1.
`` There are ten neckerchiefs in it ,"

And person_1 gave her the second nut also.
The third was a little black thing.
`` That one you can keep ,"
said person_0 ; `` and it is a pretty one too"
`` What is in it ?"
inquired person_1.
`` The best of all things for you ,"
replied the gipsy-woman.
And person_1 held the nut very tight.
was said to be enclosed.
`` Yes , that 's exactly what I thought ,"
said person_1.
`` Only think ,"
And person_1 and person_0 took leave of one another.
People called them `` the betrothed ;"
And thereupon they parted.
person_1 was confirmed.
This was certainly good news.
`` Did you know me again directly , person_1 ?"
Her father and person_1 escorted her as far as the village.
`` Yes , let us wait for a time , person_1 ,"
she replied ; and he kissed her lips.
`` I confide in you , person_1 ,"
And with that they parted.
The signature was prefaced by the words , `` Faithful till death !"
said the boatman.
Then he said slowly : `` person_0 must not refuse this advantageous offer"
`` Then do you write a few words to her ,"
said the boatman.
May all treasures of happiness be poured out upon you , person_0.
Heaven will console me in its own good time.
`` Ever your sincere friend , `` ib"
And the letter was dispatched , and person_0 duly received it.
Her part had thus come true.
The gipsy-woman had said , this was `` the best of all for him"
Yes , it was right , that also was coming true.
The black earth was the best for him.
Now he understood clearly what had been the woman 's meaning.
And again the weather bloomed and faded.
.
He had disturbed a `` Hun 's Grave ,"
and discovered the costly treasure buried in it.
`` You have found in the earth the best thing you could find ,"
said the judge.
`` The best thing !"
thought person_1.
So person_1 traveled with the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen.
And he arrived in Copenhagen.
And person_1 of the heath wandered about in the great capital.
Not a human being was to be seen.
person_1 struck a light with the help of a match.
`` Can I be of any service to you ?"
asked person_1.
Are there no neighbors or friends whom I could call to you ?"
And he raised the sick woman 's head , and smoothed her pillow.
The icy hand of death was already on person_0.
she said.
`` Ah , what is to become of the poor thing ?"
And not a word more could she utter.
-LRB- Illustration : LITTLE CHRISTINE.
`` I will now set out ,"
It was all but impossible to go on.
We can not clear the roads and fight as well.
In that way I may be able to kill them without much exertion"
So he now bade his army halt by the way.
He hardly knew himself , so changed was he.
Like an apparition of loveliness she appeared in the soft twilight.
`` What a beautiful woman ! Where has she come from ?"
This was the moment for which the brave person_0 had been waiting.
`` Wait one moment !"
gasped the brigand painfully , and he seized the person_0 's hand.
Yamato relaxed his hold somewhat and said.
`` Why should I pause , thou villain ?"
and he held the dagger dripping red above the rebel 's head.
`` Ah ,"
You are indeed a strong man to have so easily overcome us.
Allow me to give you a new name.
From henceforth you shall be known as Yamato Take.
Our title I bequeath to you as the bravest man in Yamato"
And with these noble words , Takeru fell back and died.
On the way back he passed through the province of Idum.
But the person_0 was not allowed to live an idle life long.
These she presented to him as a parting gift.
He looked round for a chance of escape.
There was none.
He was surrounded by fire.
`` This deer hunt was then only a cunning trick of the enemy !"
For Kin Jin.
Therefore hear me and bring him safely to the shore of Kadzusa"
It.
Not long shall it find pleasure in devouring innocent folk.
I will start out and kill it at once"
`` This must be the monster ,"
I can kill him with my hands"
Here ends the story of person_0 Yamato Take of Japan"
Long , long ago , there lived an old bamboo wood-cutter.
The old man.
full of wonder.
dropped his ax and went towards the light.
Her presence seemed to have a benign influence on those there.
They stood there in all weathers , in sunshine and in rain.
Still Princes person_1 gave no sign of having received their verses.
In this hopeless state the winter passed.
So again they set out for the bamboo-cutter 's house.
Will you refuse to do as I wish ?"
`` Oh , why ,"
`` I found you ,"
So I have always thought that you were more than mortal woman.
`` All you say is very reasonable ,"
What more can you demand ?"
This was to test them.
Princess person_1 wondered that the person_0 should have returned so soon.
She returned it at once and refused to see him.
He gave up now all hopes of ever winning the Princess.
But she remained silent and looked very sad.
Then the man did not scruple to make up a long story.
` Yes , this is Mount Horai ! '"
But on the way home they were overtaken by the disappointed man.
If it were the real thing it would not burn.
So the Third person_0 failed also.
Now the Fourth person_0 was no more enterprising than the rest.
The person_0 became desperate.
The Imperial messenger insisted , saying it was the Emperor 's order.
He found the bamboo-cutter 's house and dismounted.
Her only answer was to hide her face in her sleeves.
But the Princess stopped him.
Her figure faded from his sight while he looked.
These little songs always gave him pleasure.
The old bamboo-cutter went out to meet the Imperial messengers.
The men returned and told His Majesty all that had passed.
All were well trained archers , with bows and arrows.
The bamboo-cutter and his wife hid Princess person_1 in an inner room.
Even the Emperors men would be powerless.
`` The time has come ,"
We put the gold in the bamboos for you to find"
said the old man.
`` I pray you to look elsewhere"
Rest not here another moment ,"
The messenger led her forth and placed her in the chariot.
I must not forget my good friend the Emperor.
Princess person_1 's letter was carried to the Palace.
Because of his matchless skill as a hunter , he was called `` Yama-sachi-hiko"
or `` The person_2 of the Mountains"
or the `` Skillful Fisher of the Sea"
He baited his hook and then threw it into the sea clumsily.
`` What is the matter ? -- what have you done ?"
asked the elder brother impatiently.
`` I have lost your precious fishing hook --"
Look to it that you find it and return it to me quickly"
`` Though you make a million hooks ,"
I can not forgive you unless you bring me back my own hook"
asked the old man.
`` What are you doing alone in such a place ?"
`` Yes , I am he ,"
answered the unhappy young man.
But who are you ?"
I am sorry to hear what misfortune has befallen you.
You must indeed be anxious.
`` Then what can I do ?"
asked the distressed man.
I think that would be the best way"
`` Your idea is a splendid one ,"
`` Oh , there will be no difficulty about your getting there ,"
`` Thank you ,"
Large katsura trees overshadowed it.
He saw that in their hands they carried golden buckets.
`` No ordinary mortal would give away a jewel so freely.
Will you not honor us by telling us who you are ?"
said the elder damsel.
`` Certainly ,"
asked the damsel who had spoken first.
`` And ,"
said the person_2.
This kind old man also showed me how to come.
Now you know how it is I am here and why.
asked the person_2 anxiously.
should come down to the bottom of the sea"
`` Yes , indeed ,"
answered the Princess Tamayori , in her sweet voice.
said the person_2.
`` Condescend to enter , Mikoto -LRB- Augustness -RRB- ,"
Condescend to remember us forever !"
answered the person_2 , saluting his host most ceremoniously.
And he bowed again , and thanked the Sea person_0.
`` You need not thank me ,"
said Ryn Jin.
`` It is I who must thank you for coming.
`` Certainly ,"
They sat looking at each other and at the Dragon person_0.
`` Where is your proof ?"
asked the person_0.
You had better send for him at once !"
Will you send for him and inquire into the matter.
Then our innocence will be proved"
`` Yes ,"
Send for him at once !"
He led him before the person_0.
The TAI sat there looking frightened and ill.
.
`` Answer , O TAI !"
`` I have been ill since yesterday ,"
answered the TAI ; `` that is why I could not come"
`` Do n't say another word !"
cried out Ryn Jin angrily.
`` It is only too true !"
I had no intention of stealing the Mikoto 's hook.
So I hope you will pardon me"
You see the hook still sticks in the TAI 'S throat.
`` O please make haste and pull it out !"
`` All right , TAI SAN ,"
He then washed it and brought it to the person_0.
What had been done was done in heedlessness and not by intention.
So he begged the Sea person_0 to forgive his subject.
and was obliged to stay on for some time.
The years pass swiftly when any one is truly happy.
With your gracious permission , I will take my leave to-day.
I hope to make you another visit some day.
Please give up the idea of my staying longer now"
I hope you will not forget us.
These two gems are called the nanjiu and the kanjiu"
`` The nanjiu ,"
Never had he seen such a huge creature.
The Skillful Fisher stood amazed and terrified to see what was happening.
The Skillful Fisher promised and there was peace between the two brothers.
This is the congratulatory ending of the person_2 and the Skillful Fisher"
and not `` Hysken"
-- in fact , it is several centuries ago.
The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck carried on trade with Copenhagen.
and this must be understood by all who wish to comprehend this history.
The `` pepper gentleman"
Yes , that 's what they sing about the `` pepperer"
-LRB- Illustration : THE PEPPERER 'S BOOTH.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa In the old times the `` Housekin Street"
Behind the counters young men were seldom seen.
The old fellow was a subject for a painter.
The old clerks of the Haeuschen Street did not often come together.
It was certainly not an amusing life.
This he remembered very vividly.
He was the son of the merchant person_1 -- it was himself.
She was the burgomaster 's daughter person_0.
The two were playing with an apple.
They shook the apple , and heard the pips rattling in it.
`` Then you shall see ,"
she said , `` what will come out.
It will be something you do n't at all expect.
A whole apple tree will come out , but not directly"
said person_0.
`` That wo n't do at all.
I did it with my flowers ; but only twice.
`` Those are for me and person_0 ,"
said the boy.
`` That 's beautiful -- that 's marvellously beautiful !"
Soon a third leaf made its appearance.
In the neighborhood of Eisenach a row of stony mountains rises up.
It is called the Venus Mount.
-LRB- Illustration : IMPERTINENT MOLLY.
But person_1 did not dare.
_ I _ may kiss him !"
she would say proudly.
It could not well have produced less.
The tree had grown apace , and person_0 grew like the tree.
One came by a carrier , and a traveller brought the other.
He wished to come unexpectedly , and he came unexpectedly.
Yes , this was the kind of thing person_1 felt.
`` I am an honest girl ,"
said person_0 ; `` and I myself will tell you what it is.
Habit and will have no power over our hearts.
You must reconcile yourself to this.
Farewell , person_1 !"
And person_1 bade her farewell.
`` What matter !"
person_1 's father ceased to be the richest of merchants.
The father became a poor man.
Sorrow and suffering took away his strength.
person_1 went to Bremen.
`` God 's will is best !"
he would say then.
That was a mercy of Providence towards me.
Everything has happened for the best.
And years went by.
But person_1 was destined to see it again.
hewn out in stone.
The Venus Mount glimmered gray and naked over the valley.
`` That flourishes !"
he said.
`` The tree can grow !"
Nevertheless , one of the branches of the tree was broken.
`` Marry ! Ha , ha !"
he laughed bitterly to himself.
Winter had set in early ; it was freezing hard.
The time was very slow , and long , and dreary.
Tears he had none to shed , nor did he feel pain.
The thought of person_0 never came into his mind.
For a moment he felt a sensation of hunger -- of thirst.
Yes , he felt them both.
But nobody came to tend him -- nobody.
Her pious deeds shone bright upon his soul.
Yes , the roses seemed to unfold themselves in fragrance.
`` Now I shall sleep ,"
he whispered to himself.
`` Sleep is refreshing.
-LRB- Illustration : THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOUR LOOKS AFTER OLD ANTHONY.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa And he slept.
Do n't wish for such a cap for yourself.
`` Hallo ! how the nightcap burns !"
he cried out , and tore it from his head.
`` This must be gout ,"
said the burgomaster.
`` Something dazzles my eyes !"
But some one else may tell _ them _.
We have told the first.
This was done.
Once more the king endeavored to get a word from his wife.
One day `` Sister ,"
`` Brother ,"
After that she bade her retire , and shut the door.
' But Queen Gulnare soon put him out of his fears.
He is a religious , wise , and temperate king.
Besides , I have a child , the little Prince Beder.
This made us come empty handed.
' Many tears were shed on both sides upon their separation.
'"
There was once a sultan of India who had three sons.
Prince Houssain could not see this quarter without admiration.
Come with me , and I will pay you the money.
He who possesses it is master of a great treasure.
I will show you both the experiment whenever you please.
The opportunity now presents itself to show you its wonderful virtue.
The rich one was a goldsmith and evil-hearted.
and gave him a great deal of money for it.
and gave him what it was worth.
`` Now I can get on ,"
thought he , and went contentedly home.
I have a fancy to eat it all myself"
`` Two little morsels which fell out of the bird ,"
answered they.
`` That must have been the heart and the liver ,"
`` We are the poor broom-maker 's boys ,"
`` Come ,"
He did it , and thus accomplished his trial shot.
`` Now ,"
Said he , `` What , then , is your request ?"
Thereupon they ate and drank joyously together.
and loaded his gun , and looked about him.
and sprang instantly into the thicket , and brought two young ones.
You are crafty and deep"
The huntsman inquired if she was `` sick unto death ?"
`` No ,"
`` How is that ?"
asked the huntsman.
Said the huntsman , `` Why is the dragon not killed ?"
`` Ah ,"
The huntsman answered , `` I want to fight with thee"
and he breathed fire out of seven jaws.
Then she said , `` yes ,"
and both fell asleep.
`` I can not do that ,"
The King said to the maiden , `` Is what he says true ?"
`` Ah , yes ,"
The bear asked the wolf , `` Why didst thou not waken me ?"
and the wolf the fox , `` Why didst thou not waken me ?"
and the fox the hare , `` Why didst thou not waken me ?"
But the mountain lies two hundred hours journey from here"
`` Nay ,"
`` Alas !"
Then she said , `` Wilt thou get away ?"
and thought it was her dog.
and thought it was her dog.
Then she peeped down , and knew the hare by its collar.
The host said , `` I should indeed like to see that ,"
but he would make no more wagers.
I am to ask for some roast meat such as the King is eating"
`` Behold , sir host ,"
`` Behold , sir host ,"
`` Behold , sir host ,"
`` No ,"
said he , `` that is not right"
The lion said , `` Stop , let me taste the wine first ,"
and drew half a measure and drank it.
`` That is better , but still not right ,"
said he.
She answered , `` Go to meet him and you will do well"
and he unfolded the handkerchief , and there lay all seven inside it.
And she answered , `` Yes , it is true.
The host said , `` Yes , according to justice it is so"
Then she was in the greatest concern about him.
He looked round , but could perceived nothing.
Said he , `` Come down , and warm thyself if thou art cold"
But she said , `` No , thy animals will bite me"
and then he rode into the forest and his animals ran after him.
She answered , `` No , thy animals will bite me"
But he said , `` They will not hurt thee"
Come down , or I will fetch thee"
Said she , `` Shoot away , I do not fear thy bullets !"
cried he , `` and I have killed him for it ,"
and he bewailed him aloud.
Each of them looks exactly like the other , I can not tell"
Then he knew how true his brother had been"
`` Do not be anxious , I will come back soon ,"
said the man.
`` Yes.
said the wife , while the tears fell like rain from her eyes.
said the mother , as she made her way back to the house.
`` Yes , I will be very good ,"
`` Father is sure to bring you something that you want very much.
I know , for I asked him to bring you a doll.
Both the man and his wife rejoiced to find each other well.
`` Here ,"
he said to the little girl , `` is a present for you.
`` Thank you ,"
So you must lay great store by your mirror , and use it carefully"
But , alas ! in this world nothing lasts forever.
The good and gentle wife and mother was one day taken ill.
.
I am sure that nothing can save me now.
`` Oh , mother ,"
This I give you before I die.
With these words the dying woman handed the mirror to her daughter.
In spite of this the daughter 's life seemed to her desolate.
Suddenly she sat up.
`` It is certainly my mother 's soul that I see.
So crooked did the woman 's heart become.
`` Do you find it so disagreeable ,"
And the woman began to weep afresh.
`` I will tell you since you ask me.
Your daughter dislikes me as her step-mother.
The girl had for a long time past been very unhappy.
But she soon found that her efforts were in vain.
It was the only comfort that she had in these wretched days.
Her father found her occupied in this way.
The girl was frightened by her father 's severity.
Never had he spoken to her in such a tone.
Her confusion changed to apprehension , her color from scarlet to white.
She sat dumb and shamefaced , unable to reply.
But she saw that she must speak and clear herself somehow.
I am still your obedient child.
Indeed , I am.
He wished to clear up his doubts once for all.
`` This ,"
she said , `` is what you saw me looking at just now"
`` Why ,"
he said in great surprise"
`` What do you mean ?"
he asked.
`` It is indeed true ,"
and she placed the mirror before her.
She pointed to the reflection seriously : `` Do you doubt me still ?"
she asked earnestly , looking up into his face.
`` How stupid I am ! At last I understand.
How clever it was of her to tell you to do this.
And here the father wept.
`` I am ashamed ! I am ashamed !"
she exclaimed in broken tones.
`` I did not know what n filial child you were.
Her patience and goodness were rewarded at last"
Mrs.
The maid heard some one standing at the house-door , knocking.
`` No , thank you , miss ,"
said the fox , `` what is Mrs.
Fox doing ?"
Fox is dead"
`` Certainly , young sir"
`` Oh yes , my little cat ,"
she cried.
`` A wooer he stands at the door out there"
`` Tell me what he is like , my dear ?"
`` But has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr.
Fox ?"
`` Oh , no ,"
answered the cat , `` he has only one"
`` Then I will not have him"
Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away.
Fox.
Fox.
Fox outside"
But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized , old Mr.
Fox out of the house.
SECOND STORY When old Mr.
Fox , opened it for him.
The wolf greeted her , and said , `` Good day , Mrs.
`` No , thank you , Mrs.
Cat ,"
answered the wolf.
`` Is Mrs.
Fox not at home ?"
Fox is no more"
`` No ,"
answered the cat.
`` Then he wo n't do for me"
But one of the good points which old Mr.
At length came a young fox.
Then Mrs.
`` Yes ,"
said the cat , `` he has"
`` Then let him come upstairs ,"
said Mrs.
Fox , and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding-feast.
Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr.
`` What !"
`` I am Death ,"
answered the other.
`` No one resists me , and thou also must obey my commands"
But the giant refused , and began to struggle with Death.
`` What will be done now ,"
`` Dost thou know ,"
`` No ,"
answered the youth , `` I do not know thee"
`` I am Death ,"
said he.
`` Well ,"
`` Die , I shall not ,"
Then one day some one tapped him on the shoulder.
`` What ,"
`` Silence !"
answered Death.
`` I come from Rome ,"
said the Moon.
Peter 's.
She burst into tears.
`` I am looking for my brothers , the seven ravens ,"
she replied.
And they embraced and kissed each other , and went joyfully home"
`` I looked through the windows of an editor 's house ,"
said the Moon.
`` It was somewhere in Germany.
` This one has been sent to me , ' said he.
' We must be lenient towards the young man.
'"
'"
It was she , Mr.
Editor , who got together so many subscribers for your last translation.
'"
He has genius , certainly ; do n't you think so ? '"
The punctuation of the book , in particular , is very eccentric.
'"
'"
` But that would be unfair , ' objected the fourth.
'"
` Not so.
There are people enough to praise him.
Do n't let us quite turn his head.
'"
We recommend him to study the ancients , etc.
' `` I went away ,"
'"
Then he thanked her , and ascended again.
`` Why should we give ourselves a great deal of trouble to search ?"
`` Oh ,"
The toad answered , `` Just put one of my little toads into it"
The aged King agreed likewise to this.
A countryman was once going out to plough with a pair of oxen.
`` Thou dost indeed sit upon a treasure !"
said the peasant.
`` Yes , in truth ,"
`` The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me ,"
said the peasant.
`` It is thine ,"
The peasant agreed to the bargain.
`` Thou hast had the best of it for once ,"
said the Devil , `` but the next time that wo n't do.
`` I am willing ,"
`` That is the way to cheat the Devil ,"
said the peasant , and went and fetched away the treasure"
and with that he chased him into the open country.
`` Alas ,"
`` Without giving thee a chance ?"
asked the fox.
`` The chance was a bad one.
and he gave him plenty to eat until he died"
The cock replied , `` We are going to the house of Herr Korbes"
`` Take me with you ,"
said the cat.
Take great care not to dirty my little red wheels.
Herr Korbes must have been a very wicked man !"
SAID one , a princely husband I have got.
Down William came.
Wife Too much is this : -- such accusations grieve.
Husband Thou did ` st most clearly suffer his embrace.
Be that as ` twill , to-night from hence you go.
I must survive this calamity to find my death on some sea-coast"
For the last three days I have had nothing.
Fortune has sent you here.
Do not think that I am a beast of prey.
When you have become my deliverer I will never touch you.
Pray , kindly lift me up"
No ; that he will not do.
For my father 's prophecy never came untrue.
I must die on a sea coast , and not by a tiger"
True to his word , he did no harm to person_0.
Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me.
I chased him.
In the second lives a serpent half-famished with hunger.
In the same way the goldsmith also may ask you.
Goldsmiths are never to be trusted.
But never trust a goldsmith.
Thus advising , the hungry tiger went away without waiting for an answer.
But still his thirst was not quenched.
Release me now.
Oblige me : I am dying"
person_0 , calling again to mind the `` DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE"
of the prophecy lifted him up.
I chased him.
He fell into this well.
I am going away now to see my father.
Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me.
I will be there by your side to assist you by all possible means"
Whenever you are in any calamity just think of me.
I will come to you , and assist you.
Therefore , never assist him as you have done to us all.
And if you do , you will suffer for it.
I am hungry ; let me go for the present"
So thinking to himself , person_0 let down the vessel again.
The goldsmith caught hold of it , and demanded help.
Therefore he lifted the goldsmith up , who now began his story.
`` Stop for a while ,"
I am just now dying of hunger.
Permit me to go away.
My name is Manikkasari.
`` I have secured enough merit now by my religious observances.
Let me return home"
I have several jewels with me of little value.
Much more , therefore , must Manikkasari be faithful.
I do not want anything from him now.
It may also excite the curiosity of some robbers on the way.
I will go now to Ujjaini on my way.
Manikkasari requested me to see him without failure on my return journey.
He must do that kindness at least for me.
Thus thinking and thinking , he reached Ujjaini.
was the reply.
Such was the cellar into which person_0 was thrust.
We are all the children of fate.
We must obey her commands.
This is but the first day of my father 's prophecy.
So far his statement is true.
Before death comes let me think of my faithful brute friends"
Thus a passage was effected.
We would now do what we can for your release.
From that day these calamities have broken out in his dominions.
Every day people were carried away by tigers or bitten by serpents.
Thus passed months and years.
Thus passed full ten years , as prophesied in the horoscope.
Ten complete years rolled away in close imprisonment.
She breathed her last.
She was the only daughter of the king.
The king at once sent for all the snake-bite curers.
The king at once ordered the cell to be examined.
There was the man sitting in it.
Thus they discussed , while they brought person_0 to the king.
The king no sooner saw person_0 than he fell on the ground.
He was struck by the majesty and grandeur of his person.
were the only words that person_0 spoke.
The princess , too , was restored to life.
The joy of the king knew no bounds.
People began to take to their heels at the sight of tigers.
person_0 assured them of safety , and stopped them.
`` Care not for it ; it may be by magic.
That is not a great thing.
That he revived cartloads of corpses shows him to be surely person_0 ,"
said others.
I did it , and gave the crown to your honor.
The prince makes no inquiry , and at once imprisons your honor.
The gold-smith fled for his life.
All returned to their homes.
The king again pressed person_0 to accept the hand of his daughter.
They met and recognized each other , even at a distance.
They flew into each other 's arms.
Both remained still for a time almost unconscious with joy.
The pleasure of person_0 was so great that he died of joy.
The elder brother was a devout worshipper of Ganesa.
That was a Friday , a day very sacred to that god.
The god came , and asked him what he wanted.
Kindly keep it in your charge till I finish worshipping you.
But instead of that they devoured it.
The god was greatly enraged.
The elder brother was very angry.
Ganesa was much ashamed at the remark.
Thus was the second son of the Soothsayer restored to life.
The brothers had a long talk about each other 's adventures.
And so the horoscope was fully fulfilled"
By this time I 'm convinced her loving spouse.
I overcame that difficulty however , and got ashore.
It seemed to be a delicious garden.
We set sail towards the islands where pepper grows in great plenty.
All these objects served only to augment our grief.
Then a pleasing sleep fell upon me.
I got up as soon as I saw them and saluted them.
They spoke to me , but I did not understand their language.
I told them I was ready to do whatever they pleased.
We conjure you this in the rank of a brother.
Farewell.
His people have no need of them.
They understand and observe justice of themselves.
' The caliph was much pleased with my discourse.
I rose from the table , and went to him.
It is but just I should return his civility.
I have also made a vow never to go out of Bagdad.
After that you are at liberty to return.
Farewell.
God ordered it otherwise.
Some of the crew offered resistance , which cost them their lives.
, to trade with.
I confess to you that this furnished me with abundance of reflections.
I declare before Him that I give you your liberty.
I concealed from you what I am now going to tell you.
You have procured me incredible gain.
We stopped at some islands to take in fresh provisions.
`` Melancholy ! Why do you say that ?"
the Ephemera would then always reply.
`` But only one day , and then it 's all done !"
`` Done !"
repeated the Ephemera.
`` No ? then I do n't understand you.
Does all the beauty of this world cease when you die ?"
`` No ,"
`` Poor little Ephemera !"
said the Oak.
`` That was a terribly short life !"
Winter was approaching.
Already the storms were singing their `` good night , good night !"
Here fell a leaf , and there fell a leaf.
Sweet sleep to you , and pleasant dreams !"
According to human computation , it was now in its fourth century.
The hunting horn sounded , and the dogs barked.
-LRB- Illustration : THE LOVERS AT THE OLD OAK TREE.
The birch was the quickest of all.
`` But the little blue flower by the water-side , where is that ?"
said the Oak ; `` and the purple bell-flower and the daisy ?"
`` We are here -- we are here !"
was shouted and sung in reply.
`` We are here , we are here !"
replied voices still higher in the air.
It seemed as if they had flown on before.
`` Why , that is beautiful , indescribably beautiful !"
exclaimed the old Oak Tree , rejoicingly.
the reply sounded through the air.
`` That 's right , that 's better than all !"
said the tree.
He fell.
said the sailors.
`` It fell in the storm of last night.
Who can replace it ? No one can"
He slept thus till morning.
We were forced to see another of our comrades roasted.
But at last we revenged ourselves on the brutish giant thus.
We entered the port , and came to anchor.
' ` You believe him then to be dead ? ' said I.
` Certainly , ' answered he.
I saw another which had the shape and color of a camel.
I ate of it also , but very sparingly.
They presented me to their king , who was a good prince.
I observed one thing which to me appeared very extraordinary.
Nothing can save me ; every one must submit to this law.
The mountain was pretty long , and reached to the sea.
But thou hast drawn all this upon thyself by thy cursed avarice.
The inhabitants are so barbarous that they still eat human flesh.
He who is too well off is always longing for something new.
Then a snail came running up and killed two furious lions.
`` Ah ,"
`` Yes , my child ,"
`` Mother ,"
said the little daughter , `` is brother not to have one too ?"
Then she threw the apple into the chest , and shut it.
and she looked wickedly at him.
`` Mother ,"
`` Mother ,"
`` Go back to him ,"
and she wept and wept and could not be comforted.
`` Marlinchen ,"
Then the father again said , `` But where is my son ?"
`` Ah ,"
`` Ah ,"
He ought to have said good-bye to me"
It seems to me as if it were all mine"
`` No ,"
`` There ,"
`` Bird ,"
said he , `` how beautifully thou canst sing !"
`` Bird ,"
said the shoemaker , `` now sing me that song again"
`` Nay ,"
`` Wife ,"
Then the wife went and brought the shoes.
`` There , bird ,"
said the man , `` now sing me that piece again"
And when he had sung the whole he flew away.
Then one of them stopped working , `` My father he ate me"
Now eight only were hewing , `` Laid them beneath"
Now only five , `` The juniper-tree ,"
Then the last stopped also , and heard the last words.
`` Bird ,"
Sing that once more for me"
`` Nay ,"
said the bird , `` I will not sing twice for nothing.
Give me the millstone , and then I will sing it again"
`` Yes ,"
`` Yes ,"
said the others , `` if he sings again he shall have it"
`` Nay ,"
`` Nay ,"
`` Ah , mother ,"
`` My sister , little Marlinchen ,"
`` Oh , do n't go ,"
Then sang the bird once more , `` My mother she killed me"
`` My father he ate me ,"
Then the woman fell down again as if dead.
`` My sister , little Marlinchen ,"
`` Ah ,"
and she went out.
`` Gathered together all my bones , Tied them in a silken handkerchief ,"
Then he threw down the shoes to her.
`` Ah ,"
`` Well ,"
`` If the feather is so precious ,"
`` How can such a silly beast give wise advice ?"
thought the person_0 's son , and he pulled the trigger.
`` I should be a fool , indeed ,"
`` It is of no use ,"
`` You shall not repent it ,"
`` But ,"
But at the same moment the bird uttered a shrill cry.
`` Look you ,"
However , be of good courage.
`` I ought only to leave you to your ill-luck ,"
Then he sprang out and gave her a kiss.
If you do that you shall have my daughter as your reward"
`` You have certainly got what is best ,"
`` How shall I get it ?"
asked the youth.
`` That I will tell you ,"
`` What do you require for it ?"
asked the youth.
`` That would be fine gratitude ,"
said the person_0 's son.
`` I can not possibly do that for you"
Be careful about two things.
And then he ran into the wood.
He inquired whether they could not be set free.
`` If you will pay for them ,"
`` Here we bring you not only the Golden Bird ,"
But the youngest brother was not dead.
`` But yet I can not give it up so ,"
he said ; `` I will help you up again into daylight"
`` You are not out of all danger yet ,"
said the Fox.
The person_0 , astonished , asked , `` What does this mean ?"
And now nothing more was wanting to their happiness as long as they lived"
`` Come ,"
`` Husband ,"
said the woman , `` have you caught nothing to-day ?"
`` No ,"
`` Did you not wish for anything first ?"
said the woman.
`` No ,"
said the man ; `` what should I wish for ?"
`` Ah ,"
Go back and call him.
`` Ah ,"
said the man , `` why should I go there again ?"
`` Why ,"
Go at once"
`` Ah ,"
She does not like to live in a wretched hovel any longer.
She would like to have a cottage"
`` Go , then ,"
said the person_0 , `` she has it already"
`` Look ,"
said the wife , `` is not that nice !"
`` Yes ,"
`` We will think about that ,"
said the wife.
With that they ate something and went to bed.
`` Ah , wife ,"
`` What !"
`` No , wife ,"
`` Go ,"
The man 's heart grew heavy , and he would not go.
He said to himself , `` It is not right ,"
and yet he went.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
`` Go to it , then , she is standing before the door ,"
said the person_0.
`` Come ,"
said the woman , `` is n't that beautiful ?"
`` Yes , indeed ,"
`` We will consider about that ,"
said the woman , `` and sleep upon it ;"
thereupon they went to bed.
`` Ah , wife ,"
`` Well ,"
`` Ah , wife ,"
`` Why not ?"
`` It is not right ; it is not right ,"
thought he.
He did not wish to go , but yet he went.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said the man , `` she wants to be King"
`` Go to her ; she is King already"
`` Yes ,"
said the woman , `` now I am King"
`` Nay , husband ,"
`` Alas , wife , why do you wish to be Emperor ?"
`` Husband ,"
said she , `` go to the person_0.
I will be Emperor"
`` Alas , wife ,"
There is only one Emperor in the land.
`` What !"
I will be Emperor ; go instantly"
So he was forced to go.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas , person_0 ,"
said he , `` my wife wants to be Emperor"
`` Go to her ,"
said the person_0 ; `` she is Emperor already"
And before it stood a number of princes and dukes.
`` Yes ,"
said she , `` now I am Emperor"
`` Husband ,"
`` Alas , wife ,"
There is but one in Christendom.
He can not make you Pope"
`` Husband ,"
`` No , wife ,"
`` Husband ,"
Go to him directly.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said the man , `` she wants to be Pope"
`` Go to her then ,"
said the person_0 ; `` she is Pope already"
He pushed his way through the crowd.
`` Wife ,"
`` Yes ,"
said she , `` I am Pope"
`` I will consider about that ,"
said the woman.
`` Husband ,"
`` Husband ,"
`` Alas , wife ,"
Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said he , `` she wants to be like unto God"
And there they are living still at this very time"
`` Dearest child ,"
she answered , `` I may not tell thee"
`` These coffins ,"
She likewise showed him the twelve shirts which belonged to them.
`` No ,"
Said Benjamin , `` Do n't you know anything ?"
`` No ,"
they answered.
`` Tell us then ,"
they cried.
`` Yes ,"
they all cried , `` she shall have mercy , only do tell us"
Then said he , `` Our sister is here ,"
`` No ,"
She made no answer , but nodded a little with her head.
`` I shall win the princess !"
So cried both of them.
Therefore their old papa gave to each a handsome horse.
`` Hallo !"
And they told him all about it.
`` My word ! I 'll be in it too !"
`` Father dear ,"
said Jack , `` I must have a horse too.
`` Do n't talk nonsense ,"
replied the old gentleman.
`` You shall have no horse from me.
Your brothers are very different fellows from you"
`` Well ,"
And so said , so done.
`` Hei , houp ! that was a ride ! Here I come !"
But his brothers rode slowly on in advance of him.
`` Hallo !"
shouted Jack the Dullard.
`` Here am I ! Look what I have found on the high-road"
`` Dullard !"
exclaimed the brothers , `` what are you going to do with that ?"
`` Yes , do so ,"
said they ; and they laughed , and rode on.
And the brothers turned round to see what he could have found now.
`` Dullard !"
`` Most certainly I shall ,"
and there was Jack the Dullard again.
`` It is getting better and better ,"
he cried.
`` Hurrah ! it is quite famous"
`` Why , what have you found this time ?"
inquired the brothers.
`` Oh ,"
said Jack the Dullard , `` I can hardly tell you.
How glad the princess will be !"
`` Bah !"
said the brothers ; `` that is nothing but clay out of the ditch"
`` Yes , certainly it is ,"
said Jack the Dullard ; `` and clay of the finest sort.
See , it is so wet , it runs through one 's fingers"
And he filled his pocket with the clay.
`` It is dreadfully hot here !"
observed the first brother.
`` Yes ,"
replied the princess , `` my father is going to roast young pullets to-day"
`` Baa !"
there he stood like a baa-lamb.
`` Baa !"
`` He is of no use !"
said the princess.
`` Away with him"
And he was obliged to go accordingly.
And now the second brother came in.
`` It is terribly warm here !"
he observed.
`` Yes , we 're roasting pullets to-day ,"
replied the princess.
`` What -- what were you -- were you pleased to ob --"
`` He is of no use !"
said the princess.
`` Away with him !"
Now came the turn of Jack the Dullard.
He rode into the hall on his goat.
`` Well , it 's most abominably hot here"
`` Yes , because I 'm roasting young pullets ,"
replied the princess.
`` Ah , that 's lucky !"
`` With the greatest pleasure ,"
said the princess.
`` Certainly I have !"
said Jack.
`` Here 's a cooking utensil with a tin handle"
`` Well , that _ is _ a famous dish !"
said the princess.
`` But what shall we do for sauce ?"
`` Oh , I have that in my pocket ,"
and he poured some of the clay out of his pocket.
`` I like that !"
said the princess.
`` Oh , those are the gentlemen , are they ?"
`` That was very cleverly done ,"
observed the princess.
`` I could not have done that ; but I shall learn in time"
`` It 's so wonderfully cold that my whole body crackles !"
said the Snow Man.
He meant the sun , which was just about to set.
He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head instead of eyes.
`` There it comes again from the other side ,"
said the Snow Man.
He intended to say the sun is showing himself again.
`` Ah ! I have cured him of staring.
`` Away ! away !"
barked the old Yard Dog.
Away ! away ! -- and away they all go"
`` I do n't understand you , comrade ,"
said the Snow Man.
`` That thing up yonder is to teach me to run ?"
He meant the moon.
`` You know nothing at all ,"
retorted the Yard Dog.
`` But then you 've only just been patched up.
`` I do n't understand him ,"
I can feel that too"
`` Away ! away !"
The weather really changed.
A snowy radiance sprang from every twig.
It was wonderfully beautiful.
`` That is wonderfully beautiful ,"
`` Summer can not show a more beautiful sight ,"
said she ; and her eyes sparkled.
`` And we ca n't have such a fellow as this in summer-time ,"
replied the young man , and he pointed to the Snow Man.
`` He is capital"
`` Who were those two ?"
the Snow Man inquired of the Yard Dog.
`` You 've been longer in the yard than I.
Do you know them ?"
`` Of course I know them ,"
replied the Yard Dog.
I do n't bite those two"
`` But what are they ?"
asked the Snow Man.
`` Lovers !"
replied the Yard Dog.
Away ! away !"
-LRB- Illustration : THE SNOW MAN AND THE YARD DOG.
asked the Snow Man.
`` Why , they belong to the master ,"
retorted the Yard Dog.
`` People certainly know very little who were only born yesterday.
I can see that in you.
I have age , and information.
Away ! away !"
`` The cold is charming ,"
said the Snow Man.
`` Tell me , tell me.
`` Away ! away !"
barked the Yard Dog.
I was called ` Ami -- dear Ami -- sweet Ami.
So I came to live in the basement storey.
I received just as good food as ever , and even better.
Ah ! I still dream of that stove.
Away ! away !"
`` Does a stove look so beautiful ?"
asked the Snow Man.
`` Is it at all like me ?"
`` It 's just the reverse of you.
You can see it through the window from where you stand"
`` And why did you leave her ?"
`` How could you quit such a comfortable place ?"
`` I was obliged ,"
replied the Yard Dog.
` Bone for bone , ' I thought.
Away ! away ! that was the end of the affair"
But the Snow Man was no longer listening to him.
`` What a strange crackling within me !"
he said.
`` You will never get in there ,"
`` I am as good as gone ,"
replied the Snow Man.
`` I think I am breaking up"
The whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through the window.
`` I can endure it no longer ,"
said the Yard Dog.
Away ! away !"
he barked ; and he added , `` the weather is going to change"
And the weather did change ; it began to thaw.
The warmth increased , and the Snow Man decreased.
One morning he broke down.
It was the pole round which the boys had built him up.
said the Yard Dog.
Now he has got over that too.
Away ! away !"
And soon they had got over the winter.
`` Away ! away !"
And nobody thought any more of the Snow Man"
There was mourning in the house , sorrow in every heart.
It was a heavy trial.
The day of the funeral came.
It was necessary to do so"
`` When God is hard towards me , how should men be better ?"
she said , with sobs and groans.
The coffin was carried to the grave.
The disconsolate mother sat with her young daughters.
`` Thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child ,"
`` Down to my child !"
she repeated ; and a despairing supplication spoke out of her words.
`` Darest thou follow me ?"
asked the form.
`` I am Death"
And she bowed her head in acquiescence.
It was twilight.
She uttered a cry , but it was inaudible.
`` My sweet darling mother ,"
she heard her child say.
`` It is not so beautiful on earth.
-LRB- Illustration : THE MOTHER AT THE GRAVE.
`` Oh , stay ! stay !"
entreated the mother.
And she kissed and fondled the child.
What might this mean ? `` Hearest thou ?"
asked the child.
`` It is my father who calls thee"
`` They are my sisters ,"
said the child.
`` Mother , you surely have not forgotten them ?"
And then she remembered those she had left behind.
A great terror came upon her.
She seemed to recognize a few more of these.
said the child.
`` Mother , now the sun is going to rise"
And an overpowering light streamed in upon her.
The child had vanished , and she was borne upwards.
Everything was holy around her , and her heart was chastened.
THE key , which opes the chest of hoarded gold.
Unlocks the heart that favors would withhold.
Bur , said the wife , my husband made me vow.
Anselm My lord !.
Why put such questions ? -- strict is not my pen.
' Having spoken thus , they surrounded and fell upon us.
' At this discourse I changed color , and began to tremble.
' These words gave me some hope to mollify him.
I launched out in this posture , and advanced near the ship.
' At this command the officers could not forbear laughing.
' ` What do you say ? ' said the sultan.
By this science I know all enchanted persons at first sight.
This is all I have to say to you.
And so I became a hermit"
The day for the ceremony was appointed.
' These words of the person_0 of Persia greatly embarrassed person_0 Saleh.
He begged him to wait.
But these reasons were not sufficient to satisfy the person_0 of Persia.
Speak , and tell me frankly wherein I can serve you.
No king or prince in the world can dispute her with him.
Let us return to person_0 Saleh.
' Queen Gulnare yielded.
The queen consented to it with great willingness.
The greater part of the people were instantly drowned.
But she does not suffer them long to enjoy this happiness.
' This account exceedingly afflicted the young person_0 of Persia.
But person_0 Beder was little charmed.
But fear nothing.
Immediately rose a genie of gigantic form and stature.
She immediately embraced him with an excess of joy.
Do but tell me in what I can serve you.
There remains one more , which I desire you to think of.
The princess had remained where the person_0 of Persia had left her.
The officer soon perceived her , and brought her with her women.
It requires time to determine on what your majesty requires of me.
' Prince Camaralzaman 's answer extremely afflicted his father.
He communicated this new cause of discontent to his prime minister.
He therefore broke silence first.
' ' `` Sir ,"
' ` Hold thy tongue , cursed sprite , ' replied Maimoune.
` I tell thee once more that that can never be.
' This proposal of Caschcasch 's pleased equally both Maimoune and Danhasch.
She could not comprehend how this exchange could have been made.
Another time believe me when I assert anything.
I am glad I was aware of it.
Do this quickly , and bring me a speedy answer.
The king at length spoke of the lady to the prince.
I beseech you to rise.
You will think so yourself if you go and see her.
' Here the queen endeavored to calm the princess by soft words.
He was the finest and best made youth the sun ever saw.
I entreat you , do not refuse me.
The princess demanded what all these preparations were for.
Think then immediately of the recovery of your health.
' This discourse had a marvellous effect on the prince.
You see he scarcely ever leaves me.
This then is the means I have contrived to obtain your liberty.
' Next day Prince Camaralzarnan took his opportunity.
The prince demanded his reason for what he had done.
' Then he told the king how he did it.
' He then told him his history.
I HAVE made many books about well-behaved people.
Tod.
Nobody could call person_1.
Tod `` nice"
Benjamin Bouncer.
The houses were not always empty when person_1.
He was not nice in his habits.
And the bed which he went to bed in , was generally person_1.
Tod 's.
He was friendly with old person_1.
Bouncer ; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and person_1.
Tod ; they often talked over that painful subject.
Old person_1.
Bouncer was stricken in years.
Old person_1.
To tell the truth -- old person_1.
Bouncer had forgotten them.
Tod of poaching them.
I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail !"
said Tommy person_0.
It was not much of a joke , but it tickled old person_1.
Bouncer ; because Tommy person_0 was so fat and stumpy and grinning.
So old person_1.
Tommy person_0 squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.
Then old person_1.
Old person_1.
Bouncer coughed and laughed ; and Tommy person_0 puffed and grinned.
And person_1.
.
When Flopsy and Benjamin came back -- old person_1.
Bouncer woke up.
Tommy person_0 and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared ! person_1.
Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy person_0.
Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel.
A little stream crossed the way.
Tod 's stick house was before him and , for once , person_1.
Tod was at home.
Benjamin Bunny sat up , staring ; his whiskers twitched.
Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate , and said something.
Benjamin stamped his foot , and bolted.
Apparently Tommy person_0 had turned the same way.
Benjamin climbed over the wall , into a meadow.
It was getting late in the afternoon.
Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air.
-- `` Cousin Peter ! Peter Rabbit , Peter Rabbit !"
shouted Benjamin Bunny.
`` Tommy person_0 ? how many , Cousin Benjamin ?"
`` Yes , yes ; not ten minutes since.
`` Which way ? which way has he gone , Cousin Peter ?"
Let me use my mind , Cousin Benjamin ; tell me from the beginning"
Benjamin did so.
said Peter reflectively , `` but there are two hopeful circumstances.
He will probably go to sleep , and keep them for breakfast"
`` Which way ?"
`` Cousin Benjamin , compose yourself.
I know very well which way.
Because person_1.
Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to person_1.
Tod 's other house , at the top of Bull Banks.
What a nasty person !"
said Peter.
The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures.
Cottontail had seen Tommy person_0 passing in the distance.
said Benjamin Bunny.
`` They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbors.
Come on Cousin Benjamin !"
Tod had made one of his homes.
The rabbits crept up carefully , listening and peeping.
There was a strong door , which was shut and locked.
Benjamin sighed with relief.
But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder.
No person was to be seen , and no young rabbits.
The kitchen was empty and silent ; the clock had run down.
The rabbits shivered in their shoes.
sighed Benjamin.
They crept up to the bedroom window.
It was closed and bolted like the kitchen.
Tod 's bed , curled up under the blanket.
-- `` He has gone to bed in his boots ,"
whispered Peter.
Tommy person_0 's snores continued , grunty and regular from person_1.
Tod 's bed.
Nothing could be seen of the young family.
It was a shocking place , and very dark.
They sat side by side outside the window , whispering and listening.
In half an hour the moon rose over the wood.
Tod 's bed.
But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery.
After much whispering , Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel.
They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank.
They dug and dug for hours.
Benjamin was on his back , scratching upwards.
Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill.
They did the most foolish thing that they could have done.
Tod 's kitchen floor.
person_1.
First he had been upset by breaking the plate.
Then the midges had been very bad.
person_1.
Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.
person_1.
Tod likes nobody 's leavings but his own.
No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as Tommy person_0.
person_1.
He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.
Once when it flew screaming over his head -- person_1.
Tod snapped at it , and barked.
He approached his house very carefully , with a large rusty key.
He sniffed and his whiskers bristled.
The house was locked up , but person_1.
Tod had his doubts whether it was empty.
person_1.
Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.
The sight that met person_1.
Tod 's eyes in person_1.
Tod 's kitchen made person_1.
Tod furious.
There was person_1.
Tod 's chair , and person_1.
But what absorbed person_1.
He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door.
Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry.
His whiskers bristled and his coat-collar stood on end with rage.
For the next twenty minutes person_1.
By degrees he ventured further in -- right into the bedroom.
person_1.
Tod came in and out of the bedroom.
But he thought better of it , and took them away.
Tod ; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.
person_1.
Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line.
They were very loud indeed , but seemed quite natural.
person_1.
Tod turned his back towards the bed , and undid the window.
It creaked ; he turned round with a jump.
Tommy person_0 , who had opened one eye -- shut it hastily.
The snores continued.
person_1.
Tommy person_0 snored conscientiously.
person_1.
There was a noise outside the window.
Tommy person_0 shut his eyes in a hurry.
person_1.
On the way , he stumbled over the rabbit burrow.
Tommy person_0 watched him with one eye , through the window.
He was puzzled.
person_1.
Tommy person_0 snored industriously , with rather a snort.
person_1.
person_1.
Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead.
His legs were dangerously near to Tommy person_0 's teeth.
-LRB- person_1.
So was the counterpane.
Tommy person_0 was covered with a blanket only.
-RRB- person_1.
person_1.
He very nearly overbalanced himself.
The snores became more and more apoplectic.
person_1.
Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident.
Surely there never was such a sleeper ! person_1.
Tod got up and down , down and up on the chair.
The pail got fuller and fuller , and swung like a pendulum.
At last person_1.
Tod 's preparations were complete.
said person_1.
Tod.
person_1.
He went out of the house , shutting the front door.
The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.
said person_1.
Tod.
When person_1.
He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth.
He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes.
But no screams.
person_1.
Tod was mystified ; he sat quite still , and listened attentively.
Then he peeped in at the window.
person_1.
Tod watched it for half an hour ; his eyes glistened.
I will bring my bedding out , and dry it in the sun ,"
said person_1.
Tod.
I must have a disinfecting.
Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur"
He opened the door.
Tommy person_0 was sitting at person_1.
Tod 's kitchen table , pouring out tea from person_1.
Tod 's tea-pot into person_1.
Tod 's tea-cup.
Tod.
Then person_1.
Tod rushed upon Tommy person_0 , and Tommy person_0 grappled with person_1.
Inside the house the racket was fearful.
Everything was upset except the kitchen table.
And everything was broken , except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender.
The crockery was smashed to atoms.
Tod 's sandy whiskers.
Tommy person_0 put his foot in a jar of raspberry Jam.
Tod.
Tod over and over like a log , out at the door.
There will never be any love lost between Tommy person_0 and person_1.
Tod.
`` No they are not"
`` Yes they are !"
Decidedly there were lively doings in person_1.
After quarrelling at supper , Flopsy and old person_1.
Bouncer had passed a sleepless night , and quarrelled again at breakfast.
Old person_1.
The day passed heavily.
Old person_1.
Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco.
She had just finished.
Old person_1.
In person_1.
He lifted it out carefully , and rejoined Peter Rabbit.
They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit hole.
Great was old person_1.
They soon recovered.
Bouncer.
He was rather upon his dignity ; but he accepted.
Old person_1.
Bouncer was forgiven , and they all had dinner.
Tod.
The End"
He walked down with his arrow in his hand.
It is in your power to avail yourself of this favourable opportunity.
Night draws near , and it will be time for supper.
I readily consent.
Go and pursue your journey.
And this is the cause of the melancholy which you perceived.
He ordered her to follow him to them.
' This advice all the other favorites unanimously applauded.
But they are all genies.
I know not what reason you had thus to treat a father.
I therefore will make a trial this day.
I have married the fairy you speak of.
I love her , and am persuaded she loves me.
Go , only ask her.
' Prince Ahmed could not long withstand the fairy.
The sultan has imposed upon me the disagreeable task of worrying you.
How he has been informed of it I can not tell.
Pari Banou burst out laughing.
He took the tent and admired its smallness.
For this reason I dare not promise to bring the water.
It shall be as you please.
But let not that frighten you.
I will give you means to pass by them without any danger.
He therefore put his sword again into its scabbard.
It is enough for me that he is your husband.
I will tell you something.
Open the window , that the lies may fly out"
`` I looked down upon Tyrol ,"
I looked at the pictures of St.
St.
I looked upon a prison.
And their prayer was answered.
Do n't forget this.
I die with the hope that you will grow up a model woman"
On this momentous occasion she played well.
This poisoned wine she put into a bottle.
Into another similar bottle she poured some good wine.
`` You are both so good and happy"
And she filled two cups from the different bottles.
But this was of no avail.
At last the day came and her poem was finished.
It was written on a leaflet of paper heavily flecked with gold-dust.
Strange indeed it seemed to all those standing round.
After this the Emperor soon recovered his health.
That one was her stepmother.
Her envy and jealousy burned in her heart like fire.
Katoda , her vassal , was bound to obey his mistress.
He was nearly ill with anxiety.
The cottage was wide open and she was sitting facing the view.
`` Hase-Hime !"
he cried , `` it is you.
my Hase-Hime !"
The Prince 's astonishment and indignation knew no bounds.
She was a wonderful woman , and an able ruler.
The rebel 's name was person_0.
He was twenty-six feet high.
He was a wizard and a very terrible character indeed.
Do you dare to stop me ?"
`` Yes ,"
answered Eiko.
`` I ought to lead the army.
It is you who should follow me"
`` Dare you answer me thus ? Take that ,"
and he lunged at him with his lance.
-LRB- He little thought how hard he would find the fight.
The wizard saw that both his enemies remained unscathed.
They cried to him to help them.
So they presented themselves before the Empress Jokwa.
Now Shikuyu , the Fire King , lived at the South Pole.
`` Surely ,"
thought the Empress , `` Shikuyu can conquer person_0"
Eiko was surprised at learning this.
His reply was very reassuring : `` Do not have any anxiety.
I will certainly kill person_0"
They were well matched in a hand-to-hand combat.
I will not hurt such a good man"
And he pretended to retreat , turning away the head of his horse.
He now broke from the fray and tried to escape in earnest.
The wizard found that the battle was against him.
She showered all manner of gifts and honors upon Shikuyu.
Having ascertained this , she set to work at repairs.
Now all was ready.
Neither the sun shone by day nor the moon by night.
But Jokwa had recourse to magic.
`` You need have no anxiety about the broken pillar ,"
said the two ambassadors.
`` Yes , it 's all very well for you to sing ,"
And now the Bottle-neck told its story , which was sufficiently remarkable.
A ticket was placed on it , marked `` first quality ;"
`` Ah , how beautiful is life !"
The bottle-neck looked out from the folds of the white napkin.
The father took the full bottle and the corkscrew in his hand.
`` Health to the betrothed pair !"
`` Happiness and blessing !"
`` Safe return , and a wedding this day next year !"
And so saying he hurled it high into the air.
`` I gave them wine , and they gave me marsh-water ,"
he said ; `` but it was all meant for the best"
-LRB- Illustration : THE BOTTLE IS PRESENT ON A JOYOUS OCCASION.
It was black night.
The ship sank , and the crew sank with her.
The bottle was fished out and examined on all sides.
`` If I had been down in the room ,"
thought the Bottle , `` I might have learned it"
It was now washed and rinsed , and indeed this was requisite.
It was corked , and well wrapped up.
`` What trouble they have taken over yonder with that bottle !"
it heard people say ; `` and yet it is most likely broken"
But it was not broken.
Out in the garden there was a great festival.
or the `` down ;"
`` This is a wonderful passage , up into the air !"
`` That would do capitally for a bird-glass ,"
`` Yes , it 's very well for you to sing ,"
said the old maid.
There were tears in the eyes of the old maid.
ONCE upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes.
Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.
The eight little pigs had very fine appetites.
said Aunt Pettitoes , looking at her family with pride.
Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.
`` Tchut , tut , tut ! whichever is this ?"
grunted Aunt Pettitoes.
I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.
Cross-patch tried to bite me.
Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and person_0"
`` Yus , yus !"
sighed Aunt Pettitoes.
Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether"
`` Yus , yus , yus ,"
said Aunt Pettitoes , `` there will be more to eat without them"
Take your brother Alexander by the hand.
Mind your Sunday clothes , and remember to blow your nose"
Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other -- `` Now son Alexander take the hand"
-- `` Wee , wee , wee !"
Mind --"
`` Wee , wee , wee !"
interrupted Alexander again.
`` You put me out ,"
said Aunt Pettitoes.
`` Observe sign-posts and milestones ; do not gobble herring bones --"
`` And remember ,"
Alexander , you are not attending.
Attend , Alexander.
I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman"
person_0 listened gravely ; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.
Then they started.
person_0 and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles.
`` Give me one of yours , please , person_0"
`` But I wish to preserve them for emergencies ,"
said person_0 doubtfully.
Alexander went into squeals of laughter.
person_0 reproved Alexander.
said the policeman.
They had nearly run against him round a corner.
conversation sweeties at three farthings"
-- `` What 's this ? This ai n't a licence"
Alexander 's nose lengthened visibly , he had lost it.
`` I had one , indeed I had , Mr.
Policeman !"
`` It 's not likely they let you start without.
I am passing the farm.
You may walk with me"
`` Can I come back too ?"
inquired person_0.
`` I see no reason , young sir ; your paper is all right"
`` Over the Hills , 4 miles ,"
`` To Pettitoes Farm , 3 miles"
said person_0.
said person_0 , wet and cold and quite tired out.
`` Bacon and eggs , bacon and eggs !"
clucked a hen on a perch.
`` Trap , trap , trap ! cackle , cackle , cackle !"
scolded the disturbed cockerel.
`` To market , to market ! jiggetty jig !"
clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him.
person_0 , much alarmed , determined to leave at daybreak.
In the meantime , he and the hens fell asleep.
In less than an hour they were all awakened.
The owner , Mr.
He made a singular remark -- `` Hallo , here 's another !"
`` This one 's come of himself , whatever ,"
said Mr.
Piperson , turning person_0 's pockets inside out.
Mr.
There was a smothered noise -- `` Shut up !"
said Mr.
Piperson.
person_0 warmed his hands , and eyed him.
Mr.
said Mr.
Piperson.
person_0 sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.
Mr.
Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge.
Mr.
person_0 ate his supper discreetly.
After supper Mr.
Besides , the hens had seen this pig.
`` You may sleep on the rug ,"
said Mr.
Peter Thomas Piperson.
person_0 slept like a top.
In the morning Mr.
Piperson made more porridge ; the weather was warmer.
said he to person_0.
Before person_0 could reply , a neighbor , who was giving Mr.
Piperson and the hens a lift , whistled from the gate.
Mr.
said Mr.
Piperson.
But he distrusted Peter Thomas.
He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen.
` Over the hills and far away ! '"
person_0 put down a plate which he was wiping , and listened.
There was nobody there.
It was quite quiet.
After another long pause , person_0 pushed a peppermint under the door.
It was sucked in immediately.
When Mr.
Mr.
He did lock the cupboard door ; but without properly shutting it.
person_0 sat by the fire , eating his supper.
Make me more porridge , please !"
person_0 jumped , and looked round.
A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.
`` How did you come here ?"
asked person_0.
`` Stolen ,"
replied Pig-wig , with her mouth full.
person_0 helped himself to meal without scruple.
`` What for ?"
`` Bacon , hams ,"
replied Pig-wig cheerfully.
`` Why on earth do n't you run away ?"
exclaimed the horrified person_0.
`` I shall after supper ,"
said Pig - wig decidedly.
person_0 made more porridge and watched her shyly.
`` You ca n't go in the dark ,"
said person_0.
Pig-wig looked anxious.
`` Do you know your way by daylight ?"
Which way are YOU going , Mr.
Pig ?"
`` To market -- I have two pig papers.
I might take you to the bridge ; if you have no objection ,"
said person_0 much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool.
He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep.
She became quiet , and there was a smell of peppermint.
`` I thought you had eaten them ,"
said person_0 , waking suddenly.
`` Only the corners ,"
said the alarmed person_0.
Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket ; `` Sing something ,"
she demanded.
`` I am sorry.
I have tooth - ache ,"
said person_0 much dismayed.
`` Then I will sing ,"
replied Pig-wig.
person_0 , on tip-toe , covered her up with an antimacassar.
Piperson overhead.
She was excited and half - frightened.
`` But it 's dark ! How can we find our way ?"
Piperson"
Pig-wig sat down again , and commenced to cry.
Come ! I can hear them clucking !"
He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them.
There was no garden ; the neighborhood of Mr.
Piperson 's was all scratched up by fowls.
`` That 's Westmorland ,"
said Pig-wig.
`` Why do you want to go to market , person_0 ?"
inquired Pig-wig presently.
`` I do n't want ; I want to grow potatoes"
`` Have a peppermint ?"
said Pig-wig.
person_0 refused quite crossly.
`` Does your poor toothy hurt ?"
inquired Pig-wig.
person_0 grunted.
`` Pig-wig ! keep under the wall , there 's a man ploughing"
Pig-wig crossed over , they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.
Suddenly person_0 stopped ; he heard wheels.
Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman 's cart.
Do n't say one word.
Leave it to me.
And in sight of the bridge !"
said poor person_0 , nearly crying.
He began to walk frightfully lame , holding Pig-wig 's arm.
He pulled the cart crossways , and held down his whip.
`` Hallo ! Where are YOU going to ?"
-- person_0 stared at him vacantly.
`` Are you deaf ? Are you going to market ?"
person_0 nodded slowly.
`` I thought as much.
It was yesterday.
Show me your licence ?"
The grocer flicked his whip -- `` Papers ? Pig licence ?"
person_0 fumbled in all his pockets , and handed up the papers.
The grocer read them , but still seemed dissatisfied.
`` This here pig is a young lady ; is her name Alexander ?"
Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again ; person_0 coughed asthmatically.
reward"
He looked suspiciously at Pig-wig.
`` You wait here while I drive on and speak to him ,"
said the grocer , gathering up the reins.
`` Now , Pig-wig , NOW !"
said person_0.
`` Who knows ?"
replied the black dwarf.
`` Perhaps , I can help thee"
`` Do not trouble thyself ,"
said the dwarf.
The merchant thought , `` What can that be but my dog ?"
The black man has no power over me"
`` No ,"
said the black dwarf , `` I will not give up my rights"
But when he entered it , he found that it was bewitched.
`` How can I do that ?"
he inquired.
Then said he , `` I will gladly set thee free"
but he suffered her to have no rest until she consented.
`` Yes ,"
And he laid his head on her lap , and fell asleep.
`` Home to thy parents thou canst not return ,"
`` Oh , no ,"
said he , `` I will not do that"
So they gave him the boots as well.
He placed himself behind her , and no one saw him.
Have I deserved this from thee ?"
and would say nothing else.
Her father used to get quite vexed with her.
`` Who is this person_0 ? who ever heard of this person_0 ?"
he would say.
`` He is the man I am to marry ,"
said Laili.
`` Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but person_0"
And she was half mad.
The prince heard her , and turned round.
`` Who is calling me ?"
he asked.
`` Very well , you shall have him for your husband ,"
said Munsuk Raja.
`` We will ask him to-morrow"
Laili consented to wait , although she was very impatient.
and so she wandered about for twelve years.
`` I think you will never get there ,"
But Laili said she did not care ; she must see Prince person_0.
`` Well ,"
There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish.
All the time she kept saying , `` person_0 , person_0"
`` Oh , Mr.
Crow ,"
`` Very well ,"
`` You have a Rakshas in your stomach ,"
said the crow , and he flew away.
There he stopped.
And a jackal came down to the river to drink.
`` Oh , jackal ,"
said the Rohu `` do tell me what I have inside me"
`` How can I tell ?"
said the jackal.
`` I can not see unless I go inside you"
So off he ran.
After the jackal came an enormous snake.
`` Oh ,"
'"
`` If you do that , I shall die ,"
said the Rohu.
`` Oh , no ,"
She was now very old.
and they asked her what she wanted.
`` I want King person_0 ,"
she said.
`` I can not leave this place ,"
said he ; `` send her in here"
They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted.
`` I want to marry you ,"
she answered.
Prince person_0 said , `` Very good"
`` Pray to Khuda ,"
`` No , no ,"
But Prince person_0 laughed , and went into the jungle.
King Dantal wished his son to marry again.
said Prince person_0.
`` How can you marry Laili ? Laili is dead.
She will never come back to you ,"
said the father.
`` Then I 'll not have any wife at all ,"
said Prince person_0.
`` Well ,"
`` Now ,"
`` Oh , look , look !"
`` It is a Rakshas , a Rakshas !"
`` What nonsense ,"
said his father.
However , Prince person_0 would not walk in the garden any more.
and he was in great terror.
`` An old woman ! an old woman ! always an old woman !"
said his father.
`` You do nothing but think of old women.
How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened ?"
How can I marry such an old woman as you are ?"
I have loved you all these long , long years.
`` Well ,"
Laili said , `` Oh , that is quite easy.
Khuda will make me a young girl again.
`` Oh !"
`` No ,"
King Dantal answered , `` It is because you are so beautiful.
You are far , far more beautiful than you ever were.
But he will be very happy directly"
`` Oh !"
They came to another kingdom , to a beautiful garden.
`` We must go into that garden and see it ,"
said person_0.
`` No , no ,"
`` What nonsense ,"
said person_0.
`` I believe he is a very good Raja.
Anyhow , I am so near to him that I could not get away"
`` Well ,"
`` Because I want to take you ,"
he answered.
`` You can not ,"
said Laili.
`` Yes , I can ,"
said the Raja.
`` Take me , then ,"
`` What 's that ?"
said person_0.
`` Who killed him ?"
asked person_0.
`` I did ,"
answered Laili , `` and it was I who brought you to life"
said person_0.
`` No ,"
`` What will you do ,"
said person_0 , `` if I leave you ? I can not leave you"
`` I will take care of myself ,"
`` How lucky for you that you have such a wife ,"
he said.
And he made so much of Laili.
He loved her dearly ; he could not do enough for her.
The sons , therefore , did this , in turn.
`` Come home , then ,"
`` Well ,"
`` Oh ,"
`` What do I hear ?"
`` Come home , then ,"
`` Well ,"
`` Oh ,"
`` The godless wretch !"
cried the tailor , `` to let such a good animal hunger ,"
`` Come home , then ,"
`` Well ,"
`` She has eaten so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch"
`` Oh , the brood of liars !"
The old tailor was now alone with his goat.
`` There thou mayest for once eat to thy heart 's content ,"
said he to her , and let her browse till evening.
Then he asked , `` Goat , art thou satisfied ?"
`` Come home , then ,"
`` Wait , thou ungrateful creature ,"
and then everything appeared that his heart desired.
`` No ,"
`` Fall to , dear friends ,"
`` Well , my dear son , what hast thou learned ?"
said he to him.
`` Father , I have become a joiner"
`` A good trade ,"
`` But it is a table which furnishes itself ,"
replied the son.
`` To what use is he put , then ?"
asked the young apprentice.
`` He lets gold drop from his mouth ,"
answered the miller.
`` That is a fine thing ,"
When he had need of gold , he had only to say `` Bricklebrit"
After dinner the guest asked what he owed.
`` Wait an instant , sir host ,"
said he , `` I will go and fetch some money ;"
but he took the table-cloth with him.
`` Eh , my word ,"
`` What hast thou made of thyself , my son ?"
asked the old man.
`` A miller ,"
dear father , he answered.
`` What hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels ?"
`` Nothing else but an ass"
`` There are asses enough here ,"
said the father , `` I would rather have had a good goat"
`` Yes ,"
Just summon all our relations hither , and I will make them rich folks"
`` That suits me well ,"
and ran out himself and called the relations together.
`` Now watch ,"
said he , and cried , `` Bricklebrit ,"
`` I can put on the sack ,"
`` I will tell thee why ,"
`` Yes ,"
`` Oh , no ,"
So he cried , `` Into the sack , Cudgel !"
and let him have rest.
`` Dear father ,"
said he , `` I have become a turner"
`` A skilled trade ,"
said the father.
`` What hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels ?"
`` A precious thing , dear father ,"
replied the son , `` a cudgel in the sack"
`` What !"
`` But not one like this , dear father.
The miller said , `` Bricklebrit ,"
And scarcely had the carpenter said , `` Table , cover thyself ,"
than it was spread and amply covered with the most exquisite dishes.
`` Ah ,"
`` We will soon drive him out ,"
`` It is all very well for thee to talk ,"
-RRB-"
`` I want to be something !"
said the eldest of five brothers.
`` I want to do something in the world.
`` But that _ something _ will not be enough !"
quoth the second brother.
Yes , and if all goes well , I will keep journeymen.
`` That 's nothing at all !"
said the third.
I know something better than that.
`` But I do n't care at all for _ that _ something ,"
said the fourth"
`` But supposing the climate and the material are bad ,"
Listen , it is a capital story.
You see that is what comes of bricks.
The poor woman put together the house for herself.
And he carried his idea into effect.
The people always said he had a good head of his own.
said the critic.
`` Pray who are you , my good woman ?"
he asked.
`` Do you want to get in here too ?"
Peter himself talking to her.
`` I 'm a poor old woman of a very humble family ,"
she replied.
`` I 'm old Margaret that lived in the house on the sea wall"
`` In what manner did you leave the world ?"
`` Why , I really do n't know how I left it.
The sea was covered with ice as far as one could look.
.
I knew it , and a shuddering came upon me.
But I managed to open the window.
There were all kinds of merriment going on.
I succeeded in lighting up a beacon for them.
Not one remained behind.
`` Look , this is what the poor woman brought ,"
said the angel to the critic.
Thou shalt not be turned away.
`` I could have said that in better words !"
The son took the money and departed.
`` Please do not kill the dog ,"
He next met with some people fighting about a cat.
Some of them wanted to kill it , but others not.
`` Oh ! please do not kill it ,"
said he ; `` I will give you one hundred rupees for it"
Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money.
Some of them wished to kill it , but others did not.
`` Please do not kill the snake ,"
said he ; `` I will give you one hundred rupees"
Of course the people agreed , and were highly delighted.
`` You fool ! You scamp !"
`` Go and live in the stables and repent of your folly.
You shall never again enter my house"
So the young man went and lived in the stables.
said the young man.
`` Well said !"
continued the snake.
`` O master !"
`` What shall we do ? Where shall we go ?"
`` Wait for me here ,"
he replied.
`` I am not going far.
I shall not be long away"
`` Now what shall we do ?"
said the dog to the cat.
`` We must remain here ,"
replied the cat , `` as our master ordered.
Do not be anxious about food.
His highness commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him.
He then returned.
The beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived.
`` Rise up.
Be glad.
Mourn no more ,"
she said to him.
`` The woman for whom you yearn will appear at your summons.
See , here is the charm , whereby you may bring her before you"
He sat down and determined to put an end to himself.
Presently the cat and dog came up.
`` O master !"
they said , `` stay your hand.
Your trial is great , but it can be remedied.
`` Go ,"
said he , `` and may the great God aid your efforts.
Bring back my wife , and I shall live"
`` We may have some difficulty here ,"
said the cat.
You stay here.
I will go to the house and try to see her"
she asked.
`` Yes ,"
`` The ring is in the stomach of the ogress ,"
she said.
`` All right ,"
said the cat , `` I will recover it.
If we once get it , everything is ours"
`` Oh ! let me go , let me go ,"
cried the terrified rat.
`` Oh ! let him go ,"
squealed all the company.
`` It is his wedding day"
`` No , no ,"
replied the cat.
`` Not unless you do some thing for me.
Listen.
If you do not , then your prince dies under my feet"
`` Very well , we agree ,"
said they all.
This was rather a bold offer.
However , they accomplished the thing.
All seemed safe now.
`` How glad master will be !"
they thought , and ran as fast as their legs could carry them.
Now , on the way they had to cross a stream.
The dog swam , and the cat sat on its back.
`` Oh ! what shall I do ? what shall I do ?"
said the dog.
`` What is done is done ,"
replied the cat.
I have a plan.
You go and kill a small lamb , and bring it here to me"
`` All right ,"
said the dog , and at once ran off.
`` Come along now ; I have got the ring ,"
said the cat to the dog.
`` No , I will not ,"
said the dog , `` unless you let me have the ring.
I can carry it as well as you.
Let me have it or I will kill you"
So the cat was obliged to give up the ring.
The careless dog very soon dropped it again.
This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite.
the cat exclaimed.
`` Oh ! oh ! what have I done ?"
cried the dog.
`` You foolish thing , I knew it would be so ,"
said the cat.
`` Come along ,"
it said to the dog when it reached the ground.
`` We must make haste now.
We have been delayed.
Our master will die from grief and suspense.
Come on"
In a moment his sorrow was turned into joy.
Alfred the sculptor was there.
`` I should like to see Rome ,"
she said.
Now , do give us a description of Rome.
How does the city look when you come in by the gate ?"
`` I can not very well describe it ,"
replied the sculptor.
`` An organist !"
`` Has the Pope a large family ?"
asked the lady.
`` That 's not what I mean ,"
the widow persisted.
`` I mean , has he a wife and children ?"
`` The Pope is not allowed to marry ,"
said the gentleman.
`` I do n't like that ,"
was the lady 's comment.
sighed a few of the guests.
`` Oh , to travel !"
sighed others.
`` Charming , charming !"
chorused they all.
`` Yes , if I win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery ,"
said the head tax-collector 's lady , `` then we will travel.
I and my daughter , and you , Mr.
Alfred ; you must be our guide.
We 'll all three travel together , and one or two good friends more"
And the daughter sighed very quietly.
The house of the head tax-collector 's widow was the one which Mr.
They called her person_0.
`` She has been always accustomed to that ,"
her mother said.
`` She 's a beauty , and they always are easily tired.
She sleeps rather late , but that makes her eyes so clear"
It was a pleasure to hear Alfred describe anything.
`` Good heavens !"
she exclaimed.
`` Whole cities have been destroyed ,"
he answered ; `` for instance , Pompeii and Herculaneum"
`` For you are a continuation of Thorwaldsen ,"
she said to Alfred.
Alfred undertook to take a bust of person_0 and of his mother-in-law.
`` I suppose it 's only on our account ,"
`` It is highly necessary that I should mould the clay myself ,"
he replied.
`` Ah , yes , you are so very polite ,"
`` Pygmalion received his Galatea ,"
so one of the songs said.
-LRB- Illustration : KALA 'S BUST.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Ah , that 's your mythologies ,"
said mamma-in-law.
Mamma-in-law accompanied them , `` to take care of the commonplace ,"
as she said , meaning the domestic economy.
The magic of form had enchanted him.
Sophy was not pretty.
`` Thank Heaven that we are in our own four walls again ,"
`` There 's no pleasure in traveling ,"
said mamma-in-law.
`` And what bad living you get !"
said person_0.
`` Yes ,"
replied mamma , `` no such thing as an honest meat soup.
It 's miserable trash , their cookery"
And all _ was _ over with the case -- person_0 died.
`` She was beautiful ,"
A beauty ought to be perfect , and person_0 was a perfect beauty"
Alfred wept , and mamma wept , and both of them wore mourning.
`` He 's gone to the very extreme ,"
Men have no endurance.
My husband was of a different stamp , and he died before me"
`` Pygmalion received his Galatea ,"
The chief thing remains the chief.
Poor person_0 ! ours was but wayfarers ' life.
`` That was not lovingly spoken ,"
said Sophy , `` not spoken like a Christian.
`` If the key does but fit it !"
thought he ; `` no doubt there are precious things in that little box"
He searched , but no keyhole was there.
He tried it , and the key fitted it exactly.

`` That ca n't be right ,"
We will buy him"
He shall be well treated with us"
`` No ,"
`` Where wilt thou sit ?"
they said to him.
`` Good evening , gentlemen , just go home without me ,"
he cried to them , and mocked them.
`` It is so dangerous to walk on the ground in the dark ,"
said he ; `` how easily a neck or a leg is broken !"
Fortunately he knocked against an empty snail-shell.
`` Thank God !"
said he.
`` In that I can pass the night in safety ,"
and got into it.
`` I could tell thee that ,"
cried Thumbling , interrupting them.
`` What was that ?"
said one of the thieves in fright , `` I heard some one speaking"
`` But where art thou ?"
he replied.
There the thieves at length found him , and lifted him up.
`` Thou little imp , how wilt thou help us ?"
they said.
`` A great deal ,"
`` Come then ,"
they said , `` and we will see what thou canst do"
But he had other things to go through.
`` Ah , heavens !"
cried he , `` how have I got into the fulling mill ?"
but he soon discovered where he was.
`` In this little room the windows are forgotten ,"
`` Thou art mad ,"
Thumbling did not lose courage.
`` Perhaps ,"
`` Where is it to be had ?"
said the wolf.
and he described to him exactly his father 's house.
`` Wilt thou be quiet ,"
said the wolf , `` thou wilt waken up the people !"
`` Eh , what ,"
and began once more to scream with all his strength.
`` Stay behind ,"
said the man , when they entered the room.
`` Ah ,"
said the father , `` what sorrow we have gone through for thy sake"
`` Yes father , I have gone about the world a great deal.
Thank heaven , I breathe fresh air again !"
`` Where hast thou been , then ?"
said his parents , and they embraced and kissed their dear Thumbling.
`` Stop ,"
said he , `` I shall not be content with this.
`` Yes ,"
`` Oh , come with me ,"
`` Good gracious ! what are you doing up there ?"
`` Oh , come with me ,"
said the man.
`` I am a runner ,"
`` Oh , go with me.
If we five are together , we shall carry the whole world before us"
`` I must not wear it otherwise ,"
`` Oh , come with me ,"
said the master.
emptied his pitcher , and ran on.
`` Behold !"
`` He shall not succeed , however ,"
said the one with the cap.
`` Oh , yes , Lord King ,"
`` Bring more ,"
cried he , `` these few crumbs do n't fill it"
`` I will examine it no longer ,"
`` What say you ?"
They have the best of it"
The emperor 's favorite horse was shod with gold.
It had a golden shoe on each of its feet.
And a beetle came creeping forth.
`` First the great ones ,"
And so saying , he stretched out his thin legs.
`` And pray what do you want ?"
asked the smith.
`` Golden shoes , to be sure ,"
replied the beetle.
`` Why , you must be out of your senses ,"
cried the smith.
`` Do you want to have golden shoes too ?"
`` Golden shoes ? certainly ,"
replied the beetle.
asked the smith.
cried the beetle.
`` Go along !"
said the smith.
`` You 're a rude fellow !"
`` Is it not beautiful here ?"
`` How sweet it is here -- how beautiful it is !"
`` I 'm accustomed to better things ,"
said the beetle.
`` How beautiful the world is !"
`` How conceited you are !"
exclaimed the stag-beetle.
To have wings to fly ! why , we can fly now ;"
and he spread his wings and flew away.
he said , as he flew off.
Soon afterwards he fell down upon a great lawn.
Suddenly a heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds.
He therefore remained lying where he was.
It was linen that had been placed there to bleach.
On the linen two frogs were sitting.
Their bright eyes absolutely gleamed with pleasure.
`` Wonderful weather this !"
one of them cried.
My hind legs seem to quiver as if I were going to swim"
`` I should like to know ,"
Whoever does not rejoice in this , certainly does not love his fatherland"
`` Have you been in the emperor 's stable ?"
asked the beetle : `` there the dampness is warm and refreshing.
But the frogs either did not or would not understand him.
`` I never ask a question twice !"
`` Our son has engaged himself ,"
said one mother.
What joy for a mother !"
`` Our son ,"
Beetle ?"
for she knew the stranger by his horny coat.
`` You are both quite right ,"
`` Now , you also see _ my _ little earwig ,"
`` Yes , they are always busy about something , the little rogues !"
answered an earwig.
`` But I shall try to get so far ,"
`` Here we live ,"
they said.
`` We are very comfortable here.
`` Certainly ,"
replied the beetle.
It is really quite refreshing to be among one 's companions once more"
`` Perhaps you come from some muck-heap ?"
observed the oldest of them.
`` Indeed , I come from a much higher place ,"
replied the beetle.
I am traveling on a secret embassy.
With this the beetle stepped down into the rich mud.
`` Not one of them is engaged yet ,"
`` I have never seen greater beauties in the royal stables ,"
exclaimed the beetle , who was now resting himself.
`` Do n't spoil my girls ,"
`` Hurrah !"
cried all the other beetles together ; and our friend was engaged.
`` I have allowed myself to be taken in ,"
said our beetle to himself.
So said , so done.
`` Oh ,"
-LRB- Illustration : THE SCHOLARS FIND THE BEETLE.
said the mother.
`` Fie on the villain who forsook her !"
In the morning two persons came to the ditch.
Is not that written in the Koran ?"
`` Very comfortable it is here ,"
said he.
That was all very charming.
`` This is an incomparable plenty of plants ,"
cried the beetle.
I 'm proud , certainly , and I 'm proud of being so"
Now he was a sailor , and had to sail away.
The little ship sailed away.
Then a fly came and paid him a visit.
`` What beautiful weather !"
said the fly.
`` I 'll rest here , and sun myself.
You have an agreeable time of it"
`` You speak without knowing the facts ,"
replied the beetle.
`` Do n't you see that I 'm a prisoner ?"
`` Ah ! but I 'm not a prisoner ,"
observed the fly ; and he flew away accordingly.
`` Well , now I know the world ,"
said the beetle to himself.
`` It is an abominable world.
I 'm the only honest person in it.
That is what annoys me more than all.
It is all over !"
But all was not over yet.
`` Look , yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along ,"
said one of the girls.
`` There 's a little creature bound fast to it ,"
said another.
`` Creep , creep -- fly , fly -- if thou canst ,"
she said.
`` Liberty is a splendid thing"
he cried.
`` But what was I saying ? Yes , now I remember.
That 's a good thought , and quite correct.
Now I 'm quite clear about the answer.
They were given to the horse on _ my _ account"
And now the beetle was in a good temper again.
`` Travelling expands the mind rarely ,"
said he.
`` The world is not so bad , upon the whole ,"
The roof reached almost down to the ground.
The little maiden was to be my sister.
I often heard of the strange good custom.
So now the little girl was my sister.
One day there came three Frankish men.
Their dress was different from ours.
They were Albanians , brave men , my mother told me.
They only stayed a short time.
They wrapped tobacco in strips of paper and smoked it.
But they had to make a choice.
They went , and my father went with them.
Soon afterwards we heard the sound of firing.
I cried and cried till I fell asleep.
In the middle of the floor stood a coffin filled with roses.
said my mother ; and the priest announced , `` Christ is risen !"
and thus it was that for the first time I met person_0.
The summer came.
and the lower orders kiss the ground on which he has stepped.
`` How much you know !"
I exclaimed ; `` what wonders you can tell of !"
`` But you have told me the finest thing , after all ,"
he replied.
Anastasia blushed like a young rose , and my mother kissed person_0.
No Greek girl had more beautiful ornaments than she.
Her countenance glowed , and her eyes were like two stars.
`` Yes ,"
we replied.
My secret is his , my happiness is his.
Self-sacrifice , patience -- everything in me belongs to him as to me ?"
And we again answered , `` Yes"
`` And whom do you love ?"
asked person_0 , and his face and neck grew red as fire.
`` I love Anastasia ,"
`` And she shall be thine !"
I also love her ; but to-morrow I depart.
Thou must , thou shalt take it"
And we wandered home silently across the mountains.
She gazed at person_0 with a beautifully mournful gaze.
`` To-morrow you are going from us ,"
she said : `` I am very sorry for it"
`` Sorry !"
Anastasia trembled and burst into tears.
He had given all his money to my mother for us.
Anastasia was my betrothed , and a few days afterwards she became my wife"
`` I must go and see where the voices come from !"
So Raja person_0 was comforted , and began to make ready for fortune.
person_0 had started off to play chaupur with King Sarkap.
And immediately the headless corpse arose and sat beside Raja person_0.
Otherwise he will always win"
Nevertheless , he kept the hair and went on his way.
`` Fair sisters !"
quoth person_0 gaily , `` give me my task and I will perform it"
Then person_0 said , `` Separate the millet seed from the sand"
`` Is that all ?"
But the food was poisoned.
I am his sworn enemy , and I eat not of his salt !"
Take thy right hand , and place it as I said"
Time enough to take them away when you have won my head !"
So person_0 won , and took back his arms.
It has been written , and even printed.
`` The cockchafer is reading ,"
Inge would say.
`` See how he turns the leaf round and round !"
`` Your headstrong will requires something strong to break it !"
her own mother often said.
And that is what she really did.
She looked well , and her presumption increased.
And that 's the story.
`` That 's a girl who has ability !"
She 'll make a capital statue to stand in my grandson 's antechamber"
That was a never-ending antechamber.
she said to herself.
`` Just look how they 're all staring at me !"
`` It must be a great pleasure to look at me !"
thought Inge , `` and indeed I have a pretty face and fine clothes"
That was very disconcerting.
`` But all the rest of them down here look horrible ,"
she observed to herself , and derived consolation from the thought.
The worst of all was the terrible hunger that tormented her.
`` If this lasts much longer ,"
she said , `` I shall not be able to bear it"
But she had to bear it , and it lasted on and on.
That was thy ruin , Inge.
Thou hast sorely grieved thy mother"
`` Greatly hast thou grieved thy mother , Inge ,"
`` Oh that I never had been born !"
thought Inge ; `` it would have been far better.
But what use is my mother 's weeping now ?"
`` They should have punished me ,"
`` That I should have to bear so much evil for this !"
Yes , then there would be plenty of punishing to do.
Ah , how I 'm being tortured !"
And her heart became harder than her outward form.
`` Here in this company one ca n't even become better ,"
And her heart was full of anger and malice against all men.
`` Now they 've something to talk about at last up yonder.
Ah , how I 'm being tortured !"
Thus , even the children 's mouths spoke hard words of her.
`` But will Inge never come up here again ?"
asked the little girl.
And the reply was , `` She will never come up again"
was the reply.
`` I should be so glad if she would ,"
said the little girl ; and she was quite inconsolable.
It 's too dreadful -- poor Inge !"
It was the first time any one had said , `` Poor Inge ,"
It was the last sigh of her dying mother.
And again time went on -- a long , bitter time.
They were two gentle eyes closing upon earth.
It was a hard winter.
`` Yonder is a sea-swallow , flying away across the water ,"
said the children when they saw the white bird.
The Lord answered , `` I only ask for a night 's lodging"
Go somewhere else for a lodging ,"
`` Pass the night with me , it is already dark ,"
said he ; `` you can not go any further to-night"
This pleased the Lord , and he went in.
`` With all my heart ,"
he answered , `` I will go and offer it to him ;"
`` Oh , yes ,"
Run over and see how that has come to pass"
`` Quick !"
said his wife , `` get on your horse.
`` Yes ,"
He patted its neck , and said , `` Gently , Lisa ,"
but the horse only began new tricks.
And thus was his first wish fulfilled.
`` I have still two wishes left ,"
said he , and comforted himself with that thought.
Then he really did feel warm.
kissed all three , and set out.
`` Aha , you come just at the right moment !"
`` He who tries to steal my singing , soaring lark ,"
he cried , `` will I devour"
On her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle.
and went thither , accompanied by the lions.
`` No ,"
`` No ,"
`` No ,"
and opened the casket that the sun had given her.
A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself.
answered she , `` but for flesh and blood"
The bride said , `` Yes ,"
intending to cheat her as on the former evening.
The prince said , `` Pour out the draught by the bed-side"
May Heaven pity us.
For some time they were alone like this in the wilderness.
`` Oh ,"
and he begged so much that at last she agreed.
`` But ,"
Then the King said , `` To-morrow we will hunt once more"
I will not let you out"
`` Then you will have me die of grief ,"
`` Yes , indeed ,"
`` Only be quiet ,"
Then she went quite silently out of the door again.
She answered , `` Yes , I am your dear wife ,"
`` What can that be but my apple-tree ?"
thought the miller , and said , `` Yes ,"
and gave a written promise to the stranger.
and then he went.
`` Ah , husband ,"
The miller was afraid , and did so.
The father became alarmed , and promised to obey him.
Help me in my need , and forgive me the harm I do thee"
Then she knelt down , called on God the Lord , and prayed.
When the spirit had eaten the pear , it went back again"
All three seated themselves beneath the tree and watched.
Then she gave birth to a fine boy.
and conducted her inside.
and she showed the tokens , the tongue and eyes.
and asked him from whence he came.
The child picked it up , and put it over his face again.
I am Mother Holle.
`` You shall have that because you have been so industrious ,"
and on she went.
and so went on.
`` That is the reward for your service ,"
said Mother Holle , and shut the door.
and he left the little man standing and went on.
And this was the little gray man 's doing.
and he left the little man standing and went on.
Then Dummling said , `` Father , do let me go and cut wood"
Then the little man took leave of him.
But she did not understand why she was to keep away.
`` The others are there ,"
she thought , `` I may as well be there too ,"
So they had to spend the night with the goose.
They all three traveled away together , and came to an ant-hill.
by Brothers Grimm A girl from Brakel once went to St.
One was blind , the other lame , and the third stark-naked.
They all three got into the one with no bottom to it.
`` How truly happy is that one Who can from holy water run !"
Coaches and horses seemed frosted with sugar.
Towards evening it grew calm.
`` Piep !"
I 'm dissatisfied , and I 've a right to be so"
People have made a mistake in reckoning the time !"
`` That they have !"
`` But when will spring come ?"
the others inquired.
`` It will come when the stork comes back.
`` Yes , that may be all very well ,"
And away they flew.
The sharp winds swept across the snow-covered fields.
The horses ran till they smoked again.
`` Very long ,"
sounded from the next snow-covered hill , far over the field.
`` Who is that old man yonder ?"
asked the sparrows.
`` I know who he is ,"
`` I know who the old man is.
It is Winter , the old man of last year.
Yes , Winter bears sway here.
`` Yes.
Did I not tell the truth ?"
And one week passed away , and two passed away.
`` Kee-wit ! kee-wit ! Is spring coming now ?"
`` Spring !"
`` That 's what I call spring ,"
cried each of the sparrows.
And the little maiden strewed flowers all around.
That was beautiful to behold.
Every breath of air was hushed , every bird was mute.
And days went by , and weeks went by.
`` What wealth !"
Now they are already ploughing again in the field.
The people want to gain more and more.
`` Do you wish to see the golden fruit ?"
said the man : `` then rejoice"
`` It blows cold ,"
she said , `` and night brings damp mists.
I long for the land of my childhood"
She looked up at the nests , which stood empty.
I wish him a pleasant journey !"
And then the church bells rang for the Christmas time.
`` The bells ring for the new-born ,"
said the Ruler of the Year.
said the Ruler of the Year.
`` But the might is still thine ,"
said the Angel of Christmas ; `` the might and not the rest.
Let the snow lie warmly upon the young seed.
Learn to bear being forgotten while thou art yet alive.
The hour of thy release will come when spring appears"
`` And when will spring come ?"
asked Winter.
`` It will come when the stork returns"
`` When will spring come ?"
asked the sparrows.
`` Then we shall have good times , and a better rule.
The old one was worth nothing"
`` When will spring come ?"
asked the sparrows.
`` The spring !"
sounded like an echo from the hills on which the snow lay.
And the story of the year was done.
`` That is all very well ,"
but they never had one.
She climbed up the narrow winding-staircase , and reached a little door.
`` Good day , old dame ,"
said the King 's daughter ; `` what are you doing there ?"
`` I am spinning ,"
said the old woman , and nodded her head.
`` What sort of thing is that , that rattles round so merrily ?"
But the story of the beautiful sleeping `` Briar-rose ,"
`` Ah ,"
`` How canst thou dare ,"
`` Ah ,"
Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun.
Immediately the hair fell down and the King 's son climbed up.
and she said yes , and laid her hand in his.
`` Ah ! thou wicked child ,"
she let the hair down.
`` Aha !"
Rapunzel is lost to thee ; thou wilt never see her more"
In former days every sound still had its meaning and application.
and then answered quickly , `` The miller ! the miller !"
`` What , what , what is going to be done ?"
and told her what they had on hand.
and that all would pass off peaceably.
The little birds were , however , soon left behind.
They could go no farther , and fell back to the ground.
and began to let himself down again.
The birds beneath him at once cried to him.
`` Except me ,"
`` Thou , our King ?"
cried the birds angrily.
`` Thou hast compassed it by trick and cunning !"
So they made another condition.
He should be King who could go down lowest in the ground.
`` Thou our King !"
cried the birds still more angrily.
`` Dost thou think thy cunning shall prevail ?"
The little fellow soon observed that , and slipped away.
She informed her father how it had turned out.
`` Good heavens !"
`` Wilt thou contradict me again ?"
She wished them good day , and knocked modestly at the door.
They cried , `` Come in ,"
The elves said , `` Give us , too , some of it"
`` Willingly ,"
`` Ah ,"
`` Now look at her arrogance ,"
cried the step-sister , `` to throw about gold in that way !"
`` Give us some of it ,"
`` Humph ! Sweep for yourselves ,"
she answered , `` I am not your servant"
The first said , `` I grant that she may grow uglier every day"
The third said , `` I grant that she may die a miserable death"
`` I am a poor girl , and I am rinsing yarn"
`` Ah , yes , with all my heart ,"
The scullion said , `` They are sleeping soundly , too"
Then it asked again , `` What does little baby mine ?"
He answered , `` Sleepeth in her cradle fine"
`` The wretch deserves nothing better ,"
`` Then ,"
said the King , `` Thou hast pronounced thine own sentence ;"
`` Now , God bless the jam to my use ,"
cried the little tailor , `` and give me health and strength ;"
`` This wo n't taste bitter ,"
`` Hola ! who invited you ?"
said the little tailor , and drove the unbidden guests away.
struck it mercilessly on them.
`` Art thou a fellow of that sort ?"
said he , and could not help admiring his own bravery.
`` The whole town shall know of this !"
`` What , the town !"
he continued , `` The whole world shall hear of it !"
and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb 's tail.
It had to go into his pocket with the cheese.
Hast thou any inclination to go with me ?"
`` Oh , indeed ?"
The giant read , `` Seven at one stroke ,"
`` Do that likewise ,"
said the giant , `` if thou hast strength ?"
`` Is that all ?"
said the tailor , `` that is child 's play with us !"
`` Faith ,"
said he , `` that was a little better , was n't it ?"
Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high"
He looked at her , said nothing , and rode on.
Before long , it had entirely vanished from her sight.
`` What do I see ?"
he cried ; `` the spindle certainly wants to show me the way !"
turned his horse about , and rode back with the golden thread.
Immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.
`` Thou art the poorest and also the richest ,"
said he to her.
`` Come with me , thou shalt be my bride"
She did not speak , but she gave him her hand.
Jimmy dodged behind a tree.
And Fatty saw Jimmy 's brother peep from behind another.
`` Hello !"
Fatty called.
`` I 'm glad to see you"
And he told the truth , too.
Jimmy and his brother hopped out from behind their trees.
`` Hello !"
said Jimmy.
`` We were just looking for you"
Probably he meant to say , `` We were just looking AT you"
`` Oh , ho ! You were , were you ?"
Fatty answered.
He began to slide down the tree he had been climbing.
Jimmy Rabbit and his brother edged a little further away.
`` Better not come too near us !"
he said.
Fatty paused and looked at the brothers.
Sure enough ! their eyes were as pink as anything.
`` Does it hurt much ?"
Fatty asked.
`` Well -- it does and it does n't ,"
Jimmy replied.
`` How long does it last ?"
Fatty inquired.
`` Probably we 'll never get over it ,"
Jimmy Rabbit said cheerfully.
Fatty Coon was just the least bit alarmed.
He really thought that there was something the matter with their eyes.
`` Well , it 's too bad ,"
he told Jimmy.
`` I 'm sorry.
I wanted to play with you"
`` Oh , that 's all right !"
Jimmy said.
`` We can play , just the same.
I 'll tell you what we 'll play.
We 'll play --"
`` Not barber-shop !"
Fatty interrupted.
`` I wo n't play barber-shop , I never liked that game"
Jimmy Rabbit started to smile.
But he turned his smile into a sneeze.
And he said -- `` We 'll play robber.
You 'll like that , I know.
And you can be the robber.
You look like one , anyhow"
That remark made Fatty Coon angry.
And he wished that Jimmy had n't the pink-eye.
`` What do you mean ?"
he shouted.
`` Robber nothing ! I 'm just as good as you are !"
`` Of course , of course !"
Jimmy said hastily.
That 's why we want you to be the robber"
It was just as Jimmy said.
`` Come on !"
said Jimmy.
`` We ca n't play the game without you"
`` Well -- all right !"
said Fatty.
He began to feel proud of his mask.
`` What shall I do ?"
`` You wait right here ,"
Jimmy ordered.
`` Hide behind that tree.
We 'll go into the woods.
You understand ?"
`` Of course !"
said Fatty.
`` But hurry up ! Do n't be gone long"
`` Leave that to us ,"
said Jimmy Rabbit.
He winked at his brother ; and they started off together.
Fatty Coon did not see that wink.
They never came back at all.
after him.
he always laughed so loudly and so long.
His hoarse screech echoed through the woods.
And the worst of it was , everybody knew what he was laughing at"
The Jackal thought this reasonable , and let person_0 pass.
The Vulture thought this reasonable , and let person_0 pass.
`` I 'll tell you what you must do ,"
And Mr.
Tum-pa , tum-too !"
`` How very annoying !"
Tum-pa , tum too ; Tum-pa , tum-too ; Tum-pa , tum-too !"
Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up person_0"
And when the child was born , the Queen died.
After a year had passed the King took to himself another wife.
But more beautiful still is Snow-white , as I ween"
Then the Queen was shocked , and turned yellow and green with envy.
Kill her , and bring me back her heart as a token"
`` The wild beasts will soon have devoured you ,"
.
The first said , `` Who has been sitting on my chair ?"
The second , `` Who has been eating off my plate ?"
The third , `` Who has been taking some of my bread ?"
The fourth , `` Who has been eating my vegetables ?"
The fifth , `` Who has been using my fork ?"
The sixth , `` Who has been cutting with my knife ?"
The seventh , `` Who has been drinking out of my mug ?"
`` Oh , heavens ! oh , heavens !"
cried they , `` what a lovely child !"
But they were friendly and asked her what her name was.
`` My name is Snow-white ,"
she answered.
`` How have you come to our house ?"
said the dwarfs.
`` Yes ,"
said Snow-white , `` with all my heart ,"
and she stayed with them.
`` Good things , pretty things ,"
she answered ; `` stay-laces of all colors ,"
and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-coloured silk.
`` I may let the worthy old woman in ,"
thought Snow-white , and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.
`` Child ,"
`` Now I am the most beautiful ,"
said the Queen to herself , and ran away.
`` But now ,"
Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman.
`` I suppose you can look ,"
`` You paragon of beauty ,"
said the wicked woman , `` you are done for now ,"
and she went away.
When she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage.
`` Snow-white shall die ,"
she cried , `` even if it costs me my life !"
She knocked at the door.
`` It is all the same to me ,"
answered the woman , `` I shall soon get rid of my apples.
There , I will give you one"
`` No ,"
said Snow-white , `` I dare not take anything"
`` Are you afraid of poison ?"
The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned.
They said , `` We could not bury her in the dark ground ,"
I will honor and prize her as my dearest possession"
`` Oh , heavens , where am I ?"
she cried.
But Snow-white 's wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast.
she said.
Another was too tall , `` Long and thin has little in"
The third was too short , `` Short and thick is never quick"
The fourth was too pale , `` As pale as death"
The fifth too red , `` A fighting-cock"
`` Well ,"
and from that time he got the name of King Thrushbeard.
When the King heard him he said , `` Let him come up"
`` It does not please me ,"
She had to stoop in order to go in at the low door.
`` Where are the servants ?"
said the King 's daughter.
`` What servants ?"
You weave baskets"
He went out , cut some willows , and brought them home.
`` I see that this will not do ,"
`` See ,"
`` Alas ,"
`` Alas ! what will happen to me ?"
cried she ; `` what will my husband say to this ?"
She ran home and told him of the misfortune.
`` Who would seat herself at a corner of the market-place with crockery ?"
I wish you and I had been there too"
ONCE upon a time there was a frog called person_0.
But person_0.
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton.
The Alderman , however , eats salad"
MR.
It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.
MR.
`` I know a good place for minnows ,"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.

Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle.
He had the dearest little red float.

SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat , AND person_0.
Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.
Once upon a time , a tiger was caught in a trap.
By chance a poor person_0 came by.
`` Let me out of this cage , oh pious one !"
cried the tiger.

replied the person_0 mildly , `` you would probably eat me if I did"
`` Not at all !"
`` My dear sir ,"
person_0 ? You look as miserable as a fish out of water !"
The person_0 told him all that had occurred.
`` How very confusing !"
`` It 's very odd ,"
`` You 've been away a long time !"
growled the savage beast , `` but now let us begin our dinner"
_ Our _ dinner !"
`` Give me five minutes , my lord !"
`` Oh , my poor brain ! oh , my poor brain !"
cried the jackal , wringing its paws.
`` Pooh !"
`` Of course !"
`` Yes , you shall !"
`` Yes , my lord !"
`` And that is the person_0 --"
`` Yes , my lord !"
`` And that is the cage --"
`` Yes , my lord !"
`` And I was in the cage -- do you understand ?"
`` Yes -- no -- Please , my lord --"
`` Well ?"
cried the tiger impatiently.
`` Please , my lord ! -- how did you get in ?"
`` How ! -- why in the usual way , of course !"
`` Perfectly !"

I now look up to the Yard Cock on the partition.
said the Cucumber.
In the night the weather became very bad.
Hens , chickens , and even the Cock himself sought shelter.
He had been `` born old ,"
`` Moreover , they are tedious things to converse with ,"
said the Weathercock.
`` They are tedious , and all is tedious ,"
he said.
`` The world is worth nothing ,"
he cried.
`` The whole thing is a stupidity"
The Weathercock was what is called `` used up ;"

the Yard Cock inquired of his hens and chickens.
`` It was a little rough -- the elegance was wanting"
`` Garden plant !"
`` Cock-a-doodle-doo !"
he crowed.
No one can stand the sight of a basilisk.
`` It 's all stupid stuff !"
said a voice within the Weathercock.

The French call this floweret `` Marguerite ,"
and so on.
Every one asks in his own language.
`` Darling Marguerite daisy !"
But Marguerite did not answer him.
She was angry that he had called her a `` woman ,"
when she was yet a girl ; and there is a great difference.
`` They are very pretty ,"
thought the person_0.
Like all young lads , he looked out for the elder girls.
Then he flew of to the anemones.
`` Who is that ?"
he asked.
`` That is my sister ,"
replied the Pease Blossom.
`` Oh , indeed ; and you will get to look like her !"
he said.
And away he flew , for he felt quite shocked.
No , he did not like her.
`` I shall take her ,"
said the person_0.
And he made an offer for her.
But the mint stood silent and stiff , listening to him.
And thus it happened that the person_0 had no wife at all.
So the person_0 became what we call an old bachelor.
It was late in autumn , with rain and cloudy weather.
One must have freedom , sunshine , and a little flower"
`` Now I am perched on a stalk , like the flowers ,"
said the person_0.
`` It certainly is not very pleasant.
It must be something like being married , for one is stuck fast"
And he consoled himself in some measure with the thought.
`` That 's very poor comfort ,"
said the potted Plants in the room.
`` But ,"
thought the person_0 , `` one can not well trust these potted Plants.
They 've had too much to do with mankind"
`` I have no money ,"
`` I know already what thou art in need of ,"
`` A soldier and fear -- how can those two things go together ?"
he answered ; `` thou canst put me to the proof"
`` Very well , then ,"
answered the man , `` look behind thee"
`` Oho !"
`` I see quite well ,"
`` If it does not endanger my salvation ,"
replied the soldier , who knew very well who was standing by him.
`` If it does , I 'll have nothing to do with it"
`` Thou wilt look to that for thyself ,"
After this the Devil vanished.
`` If that is your only trouble ,"
said Bearskin , `` I have plenty of money"
`` Come with me ,"
This pleased Bearskin well , and he went.
If it were nothing but ugliness , I might get used to that"
But pray to God to preserve my life"
Nothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters.
`` Take care ,"
`` Beware !"
said the second.
`` Thou must always do as he likes ,"
began the elder again , `` or else he will growl"
The bride was silent , and did not let them vex her.
`` We have not got so far as that yet ,"
answered Bearskin , `` thou must first make me clean"
When the Devil had gone away , Bearskin was quite lighthearted.
He landed with his party near the park.
And these in two divided ere 'twas dark.

`` That was a remarkably fine dinner yesterday ,"
Nothing was left but the pegs at the ends of the sausages.
`` That was not at all bad ,"
said the other person_1 ; `` but how does one prepare this soup ?"
In foreign parts one ca n't get cheese-rinds and bacon every day.
Only four mice announced themselves ready to depart.

I went to sea at once.
I went in a ship that steered towards the north.
There were great lakes there too.
I kept with my own kind.

And now came the real great party of elves.
I was quite touched.
` Why , you have just seen it.
I fancy you hardly knew your sausage-peg again ? '"
` You only mean that as a joke ,"
I replied.
But before the little person_1 said what this `` something more"
asked the person_1.
`` Why ,"
Therefore it yet remains to provide for hearing and taste ! '"
`` That was a heavy soup !"
said the person_1.
`` Shall we not soon hear about the preparation ?"
`` That was all ,"
said the little person_1 , with a bow.
said the person_1.
_ What the second little person_1 had to tell.
_ `` I was born in the palace library ,"
said the second person_1.
' She asked me if I were a poet.
`` Understanding is the most important thing in every affair.

They were divided into the clean and the dirty ants.

I could not be mistaken , and I ate her up.
She uttered a piercing cry when she saw me so near.
said the little person_1.
I said so to myself , and told the others also.
`` Let us hear what the third has to say ,"
was now the person_1 's command.
`` Peep ! peep !"
She toppled the sausage-peg with the crape covering over in a moment.
And let us hear what she said.
_ `` I betook myself immediately to the largest town ,"
' `` Now , this gave me an interest in the prisoner ,"
I really got to love him , for these things are reciprocal.
_ I _ stayed , but _ he _ did not stay.
I do n't know his history"
`` It was dark , and night was coming on.
'"
` Nothing ! '"
I exclaimed.
`` I was quite struck.
He is capable of making me queen , for the sake of truth"
`` Your truth is a falsehood ,"
said the person_1 who had not yet spoken.
`` I can prepare the soup , and I mean to prepare it"
_ How it was prepared.
_ `` I did not travel ,"
the third person_1 said.
I stayed at home.
I have what I know through my own reflections.
`` Can not any one else do that ?"
asked the person_1.
`` No ;"
replied the mouse.
`` The power is contained only in the tail of the person_1"
`` Of course -- certainly you are my queen ,"
he said.

Then the eldest of the brothers dreamt a splendid dream.
But the sister dreamt nothing about going out into the wide world.
It never entered her mind.
Her world was her father 's house.
`` I shall ride forth into the wide world ,"
said the eldest brother.
Much shall change for the better when I am there"
In the case of the eldest this pre-eminent sense was Sight.
This was to do him especial service.
He followed them.
It was the same thing everywhere.
`` I see I must attack these things vigorously ,"
he said ; and attacked them with vigor accordingly.
`` Over !"
said the wild swan , who flew across the sea towards the east.
`` Over !"
`` I fancy the _ Seer _ must have fared badly ,"
His hearing was _ too _ fine.

It was unbearable.

said the third brother.
`` I have a sharp _ nose _ !"
`` I can smell fire !"
`` Every fragrant spot in the realm of the beautiful has its frequenters ,"
he said.
Thus he spake.
`` I will give my seal to the flower ,"
`` Thus it always fares with the beautiful in this world !"
`` They should have strewed incense for me ,"
said the fourth brother.
`` That was no delicacy ,"
he said.
`` I shall start on my travels.
But what conveyance shall I choose ? Are air balloons invented yet ?"
`` Good : then I shall choose an air balloon ,"
he said ; `` my father knows how they are made and guided.
And he obtained what he wanted , and flew away.
Now he was out in the wide world.
Then he sat on the church steeple.
All the chimneys in the town were smoking merrily.
`` Those are altars erected to thy honor !"
said the Wind , who wished to say something agreeable to him.
he said.
I 'll sit here so long as the wind blows.
I 'll enjoy a slight rest.

`` Even to my father 's house ,"
she repeated.

The tree no longer shook.
And Fatty felt better at once.
But they had no such idea at all.
`` Which way are you going to fell her ?"
the hired man asked.
He said HER , meaning the TREE , of course.
`` That way !"
said Farmer Green , pointing toward the woods.
`` But will she clear the trees on the edge of the woods ?"
The hired man appeared somewhat doubtful.
`` Oh , to be sure -- to be sure !"
answered Farmer Green.
And with that they set to work again.
Yes ! it began to lean toward the woods.
Slowly , slowly it tipped.
And Fatty was scared half out of his mind.
And there he waited.
There was nothing else he could do.
What was going to happen to him then ? Fatty wondered.
And Fatty felt the tree falling , falling.
He could hear Johnnie Green shouting.
And he shut his eyes and held fast to his branch.
Then came the crash.
But to his great surprise he was still far above the ground.
You see , Farmer Green had been mistaken.
It was no wonder that Johnnie Green shouted.
Fatty was going straight into the woods.
It was no wonder that Johnnie Green shouted.
For he had lost his pet coon.
He had lost him before he ever had him.
And he was sadly disappointed.
and used violence and beat him until he was near death.
and thereupon he died.
`` What dost thou mean by that ?"
He answered , `` I must not tell thee"
And thus , after all , the bright sun did bring it to light"
They had finished their evening meal at Farmer Green 's house.
`` We 'll go coon-hunting again to-night ,"
he said to Johnnie and the hired man.
`` The corn has brought the coons up from the swamp.
We 'll start as soon as it grows a little darker"
Well -- after a while they set out for the cornfield.
And sure enough ! old Spot soon began to bark.
`` He 's treed !"
said Farmer Green , pretty soon.
In the moonlight they could see the coon quite plainly.
`` Another little feller !"
cried Farmer Green.
This one 's no bigger than the one we saw last night"
But there were no trees near enough the big chestnut for that.
He was n't afraid.
He felt perfectly safe in his big tree.
He 'd make a fine pet"
`` A pet !"
exclaimed Farmer Green.
`` You remember that pet fox you had , that stole my chickens ?"
`` Oh , I 'd be careful ,"
Johnnie promised.
Farmer Green smiled.
`` All right !"
he said at last.
`` I 'll give you one more chance , Johnnie.
Johnnie promised that nothing of the sort should happen.
He , too , shivered and shook.
Come in and rest.
I only ask of you at present to be your friend.

You will have nothing to do to-day : I leave you here.
' The gardener put on his best clothes , and went out.
They killed the murderer with their beaks.
Camaralzaman took an axe , and began his work.
' Prince Camaralzaman would not be outdone in generosity by the gardener.
They had a long dispute about it.
I will only take leave of the gardener , and follow you.
Great was her astonishment when she found the olives mingled with gold-dust.
I went there to call him.
They were so diligent , that he set sail the same day.
He sat down and asked where the king was.
And that seemed best to the others also.
`` There is no need for that ,"
`` They will not ,"
replied the man , `` I have no claim on you"
The first was to answer , `` All three of us ,"
to every question ; the second was to say , `` For money ,"
and the third , `` And quite right too !"
`` Yes ,"
said the host , `` that is what I mean"
The second said , `` For money"
`` Of course ,"
said the host.
The third said , `` And quite right too !"
`` Certainly it is right ,"
said the host.
the second said , `` For money ,"
and the third , `` and quite right too !"
`` Indeed it is right ,"
They , however , paid still more than he had asked.
`` Yes , indeed they are ,"
said the host , `` they are not very wise"
`` For money ,"
and `` And quite right too !"
But they saw and knew all that was going on.
The host did as he was asked.
`` All three of us ,"
said the first , `` For money ,"
`` There now , you hear ,"
said the host , `` they confess it themselves"
They were taken to prison , therefore , and were to be tried.
`` All three of us"
`` Why did you kill the merchant ?"
`` For money"
`` You wicked wretches , you have no horror of your sins ?"
`` And quite right too !"
`` They have confessed , and are still stubborn ,"
said the judge , `` lead them to death instantly"
Then said the headsman , `` It is a pardon coming ,"
and `` Pardon ! pardon !"

and he pointed to the innkeeper.
`` If you will serve me for seven years ,"
`` We have no choice and are compelled to accept ,"
they replied.
`` I will , however , then set you a riddle ,"
`` Who knows ?"
said she.
`` Confide your trouble to me"
`` What riddle is that ?"
she inquired.
`` I will tell you.
`` Hast thou paid particular attention to everything ?"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` I know enough , and will contrive to save myself"
And asked the second , `` But what will your spoon be ?"
`` The rib of a whale , that is to be our silver spoon"
`` An old horse 's hoof is to be our wineglass"
cried they , `` thou art not our mother.
The miller thought to himself , `` The wolf wants to deceive someone ,"
Then the miller was afraid , and made his paws white for him.
Truly men are like that.
Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest.
She sought her children , but they were nowhere to be found.
Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.
`` Ah , heavens ,"
and danced for joy round about the well with their mother"
`` Thunder and lightning ,"
cried the tailor , `` what is that ?"
`` What dost thou want here , thou tiny fly 's leg ?"
`` If that is what thou art after ,"

Does that suit thee ?"
`` All right ,"

`` What ! the well and the spring too ,"
Be on thy guard , old Hans , this is no serving-man for thee"
asked the little tailor , and went to cut the wood.

`` What !"
Time brings counsel.
`` Have you no children ,"
asked the stranger , `` who could help you with your work ?"
`` No ,"
`` But tell me ,"
Trees must be trained while they are young"
`` That is how it was with your son ,"
`` Truly it is a long time since he went away ,"
replied the old man , `` he must have changed"
`` Would you know him again if he were to come to you ?"
asked the stranger.
`` Hardly by his face ,"
`` Good God !"
cried the old man , `` Thou art really my son !"
and love for his child stirred in his heart.
`` But ,"
`` Ah , father ,"
`` Alas , my son ,"
I will go to him myself this very day"
`` Lord count ,"
Mark what I am saying , for thy life depends on it"
It was already dark when he arrived.
`` What hast thou got in thy little cask , old lady ?"
asked one.
`` A good mouthful of wine ,"
she answered.
`` Let us have it here , then ,"
`` Hallo , comrades ,"
The old woman carried her cask into the stable.
`` Good morning , Sir Count ,"
`` Now ,"
thought the thief , `` the favourable moment has come ,"
`` Dear wife ,"
The countess gave him the sheet.
`` I tell you what ,"
`` Art thou a wizard ?"
`` You did not bury me ,"
said the thief , `` but the poor sinner on the gallows ,"
`` But thou hast not reached the end yet ,"
The master smiled and returned no answer.

Then he bolted the door upon them , and went away.

`` You must help me open it"
And they both sat down before the box and opened it.

`` You silly old man ,"
We might have had twice as much silver and gold as this.
You are certainly an old fool !"
She would not listen to one word he said.
`` How could she ,"
They had not long to wait.
She hastened to the door and knocked loudly.
I only hope this may be a lesson to you in the future !"
The mayor stood at the open window.
`` Hark ` ee , youngster !"
he cried.
`` You 're a good boy ,"
said Mr.
Mayor.
`` You 're a civil boy.
How much have you got in it ?"
`` Half a quartern ,"
stammered the boy , in a frightened voice.
`` And this morning she had just as much ,"
the mayor continued.
`` No ,"
replied the boy , `` it was yesterday"
`` Two halves make a whole.
Poor child -- there , go !"
Accordingly the boy went on his way.
`` I was very nearly sailing away ,"
she said.
For six hours I 've been standing in the water.
Have you brought anything for me ?"
`` Ah , how that revives one !"
And you , my boy ! you look quite pale.

`` I work and toil as much as ever I can ,"
As she spoke , a somewhat older woman came towards them.
This was a friend of the laundress.
She was called among the neighbors , `` Lame person_0 with the curl"
cried the visitor.

`` Ah , so he spoke to you , my child ?"
said the washerwoman ; and her lips trembled as she spoke.
Still , I have had much misfortune from that house"
and person_0 smiled.
`` The mayor has a great dinner party to-day.
The footman told me about it.
`` Died !"
repeated the laundress -- and she became pale as death.
`` Yes , certainly ,"
said person_0.
And the tears rolled down her cheeks.
I feel quite ill"
And she leaned against the plank.
`` Good heavens , you are ill indeed !"
exclaimed the other woman.
`` Come , come , it will pass over presently.
But no , you really look seriously ill.
.
The best thing will be for me to lead you home"
`` But my linen yonder --"
`` I will take care of that.
Come , give me your arm.
The laundress 's limbs shook under her.
`` I have stood too long in the cold water ,"
The fever is in my bones.
O kind Heaven , help me to get home ! My poor child !"
and she burst into tears.
The two women could make only slow progress.
The mayor and his guests came to the window.
`` That 's the washerwoman !"
he said.
`` She has taken a glass too much.
She is good for nothing.
It 's a pity for the pretty son she has.
Soon the patient felt a little better.
`` Thanks , you kind soul ,"
she said to person_0.
`` I will tell you all when the boy is asleep.

You have not been educated as he has.
You are not equals in mind , and there is the misfortune.
He is a widower without children , and is well to do.
Think it over.
It was a heavy night that I had to pass through.
And now there was no longer a doubt in my mind.
I went home to my mistress.
Then my mistress put her arms round me and kissed me.
`` Oh , you were a dear , good mistress ,"
cried person_0.
`` Never shall I forget how kind you and your husband were !"
We had not any children yet.

He was here at his mother 's funeral.
I saw him stand by the grave.

`` We had five hundred dollars ,"
We went back more and more , and fell into debt.
All that we had was sold , and my husband died.

`` There was some fuss between my brother and her ,"
said the mayor.

They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor.
But there was nothing to be seen.
They returned to the kitchen.
`` Here 's one of your kittens at least ,"

She seemed to be in a terrible fright.

answered the rabbit.
`` What an unlucky fellow you are !"
said the rabbit.
The badger thanked him and begged him to apply it at once.
He rolled over and over and howled loudly.
This was just what the rabbit wanted , so he agreed.
They both got into their boats and set out.
He cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him.
Thus at last he kept his promise to the old farmer.
The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes.
THE shinansha , OR THE SOUTH POINTING CARRIAGE.
Kotei was the son of the Emperor Yuhi.
Soon after this her son Kotei came into the world.
His early reign was greatly troubled by the rebel Shiyu.
Kotei again declared war against Shiyu.
The battle began in earnest.
Here he sat down on the bank and was lost in thought.
It was autumn.
He set to work and persevered till he invented the first boat.
As it came nearer Kotei saw that it was a great Dragon.
The Dragon approached and bowed down its head before the Emperor.
This is a messenger from Heaven.
My time here is finished !"
He then mounted the Dragon , which began to ascend towards the sky.
They were recognized as having belonged to the Emperor Kotei.
His head was placed on the nine and ninetieth post.
Then he seized his gun and went out hunting.
The raven hung his head and thought it over for a longtime.
At length he croaked , `` I have it"
He swallowed him , and went down to the bottom of the lake.
Every one can imagine what a state of mind he was in.
`` Thou knowest how to find all kinds of hiding-places ,"
`` That 's a hard task ,"
answered the fox , looking very thoughtful.
At length he cried , `` I have it !"
And now the time arrived when she was to search for him.
The youth went straight to the palace.
The cow-herd answered , `` It is still standing out there eating.
It would not stop and come with us"
The cow-herd said , `` It must have run away"
The peasant , however , said , `` Do n't tell me that ,"
, and gave him a slice of bread with cheese on it.
The woman said , `` Oh , heavens ! It is my husband !"
`` Ah ,"
The woman said , `` But I have nothing but bread and cheese"
`` I am contented with anything ,"
The peasant answered , `` I have a soothsayer inside it"
`` Can he foretell anything to me ?"
said the miller.
`` Why not ?"
The miller said , `` What did he say ?"
`` Bless me !"
cried the miller , and went there and found the wine.
`` Now go on ,"
said he.
`` Upon my word !"
cried the miller , and went thither , and found the roast meat.
`` That would be a fine thing !"
cried the miller , and went there and found the salad.
`` That would be a fine thing !"
cried the miller , and looked there , and found the cakes.
The miller asked , `` What did he say ?"
The miller said , `` The Devil must go out ,"
The Mayor , however , said , `` But my servant must go first"
Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water.
and they rolled the barrel down into the water.
`` Yes , truly ,"
Said the peasants , `` Are there any more there ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said he , `` more than I could do anything with"
`` Be easy ,"
`` What else can that be ,"
thought the miller , `` but a young puppy or kitten ?"
and he promised her what she desired.
`` Of what use to me are riches and prosperity ?"
In the meantime prosperity again returned to the miller 's house.
He never let the boy himself go near the water.
`` Beware ,"
The poor woman did not leave the pond.
Presently a dream took possession of her.
`` Thou must have met with a misfortune ,"
she said , `` since thou hast sought out my lonely cottage"
With tears , the woman related what had befallen her.
`` Be comforted ,"
said the old woman , `` I will help thee.
Here is a golden comb for thee.
The wife did as the old woman told her.
`` Alas , what does it profit me ?"
High mountains and deep valleys lay between them.
When he had finished he saw that the shepherdess was weeping bitterly.
`` Why art thou weeping ?"
he asked.
`` Alas ,"
If you desert me like this , I will tell the Princess Labam"
Then the parrots all flew back to their person_0 , chattering.
But the parrots would not tell him where she lived.
`` You can never get to the Princess Labam 's country"
That is all they would say.
.
`` I must go ,"
he said ; `` I must see what she is like.
Tell me where her country is"
`` We do not know where it is ,"
answered his father and mother.
`` Then I must go and look for it ,"
said the prince.
`` No , no ,"
they said , `` you must not leave us.
You are our only son.
Stay with us.
You will never find the Princess Labam"
`` I must try and find her ,"
said the prince.
`` Perhaps God will show me the way.
Still I must go"
he said , `` I may want them"
His father , too , gave him plenty of rupees.
`` My child ,"
`` Now ,"
He opened his handkerchief , and took out a sweetmeat.
He found an ant in it.
He took out another.
There was an ant in that one too.
`` Never mind ,"
`` Why do you roar like that ?"
said the young person_0.
`` What is the matter with you ?"
`` I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years ,"
`` Well ,"
`` Oh , no ,"
said the tiger , `` I wo n't eat you.
Do make me well"
`` What man hurt you that you roared so loud ?"
said the wife.
`` No one hurt me ,"
`` Where is he ? Show him to me ,"
said his wife.
`` If you promise not to kill him , I will call him ,"
said the tiger.
`` I wo n't kill him ; only let me see him ,"
answered his wife.
and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up.
The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things.
One said , `` I want this ;"
and so on.
I will shoot four arrows in four different directions.
To this they agreed , and the prince shot off his first arrow.
Away raced the fakirs to get it.
`` The Princess Labam 's country ,"
they answered.
`` Who are you ?"
she said.
`` Where do you come from ?"
`` I come from a far country ,"
he said ; `` do let me stay with you to - night"
`` No ,"
You can not stay in my house"
`` You are my aunty ,"
`` Well ,"
he said , `` I will give you food"
The old woman and the person_0 's son then dined together.
`` Do n't go ,"
said the prince.
`` You shall have plenty of water directly"
and then it filled with water.
and the bowl stopped filling.
`` See , aunty ,"
By this time night had come.
`` Aunty ,"
`` There is no need ,"
she said.
When it was quite black night the princess got up.
He said to himself , `` How lovely she is !"
`` Bed ,"
and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf.
`` Where did you get all that betel-leaf ?"
asked the princess.
`` We found it near your bed ,"
answered the servants.
In the morning the old woman came to the person_0 's son.
`` Now it is morning ,"
`` I am ill to-day , dear aunty ,"
said the prince ; `` do let me stay till to-morrow morning"
`` Good ,"
said the old woman.
`` See , mother ,"
Her mother was very glad too.
`` Yes , my child ,"
she said ; `` Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl"
`` Aunty ,"
he answered , `` I am not well enough yet.
Let me stay a few days longer.
So the old woman let him stay.
At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep.
The bag gave him a glorious ring.
`` Who are you ?"
she said to the prince.
`` Do not be afraid , princess ,"
he said ; `` I am no thief.
I am a great person_0 's son.
`` Well ,"
Her mother told this to the king.
`` Good ,"
If he fails I will kill him.
If he can not do this he shall die"
`` Oh ,"
You will be killed too , if you try.
Do go away"
But the prince would not listen to anything she said.
`` Whoever wishes to marry my daughter ,"
If he can not , then I have him killed.
The prince was very sorry when he heard this.
`` Why do you look so sad ?"
said the Ant-person_0.
`` Be happy ,"
The prince was very glad when he saw the oil.
The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king.
When he heard of the demons the person_0 's son was very sad.
`` What can I do ?"
he said to himself.
`` How can I fight with these two demons ?"
How can I do this ?"
`` Do not be frightened ,"
said the tiger.
`` Be happy.
I and my wife will fight with them for you"
Then the person_0 's son took out of his bag two splendid coats.
`` Yes ,"
`` Then call your demons ,"
said the person_0 's son , `` and these tigers will fight them"
`` That is good ,"
said the king.
Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum.
You must go and beat it.
If you can not do this , I will kill you"
`` Little bed ,"
he said , `` up in the sky is the king 's kettle-drum.
I want to go to it"
`` You have ,"
`` If I can , I will ,"
said the person_0 's son.
It was a very , very thick trunk.
The person_0 's son went back to the old woman 's house.
`` I had his oil crushed out by the ants ,"
he said to himself.
`` I had his demons killed by the tigers.
My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum.
At night he went on his bed to see the princess.
`` To-morrow ,"
he said to her , `` your father will kill me"
`` Why ?"
asked the princess.
How can I ever do that ?"
said the person_0 's son.
`` Do not be afraid ,"
`` To-morrow ,"
' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet 's blade"
The king said , `` Now you can marry my daughter"
Then the wedding took place.
`` Yes ,"
said Hans , `` I will do all that"
`` Dear friend ,"
`` Were you indeed at the wedding ?"
`` Yes , indeed I was there , and in full dress.
and broke in two"
`` How in the world can I get some ?"
thought he ? At last he hit upon a plan.
`` What do you want , Mr.
Crow ? You and I do n't feed alike"
The Pigeon agreed , and they went on in company.
Let 's be going home before it is too late"
And so they did.
says he.
`` Nonsense ! Crows never have indigestion ,"
said the Pigeon.
`` Why do you say that , master ? I have indigestion"
`` Well , be careful ,"
said the Pigeon , and flew away.
`` Now 's my time !"
thought Mr.
Crow , and alighted on a dish containing some dainty food.
Click ! The cook heard it , and looked round.
said he , and threw him into his basket.
And the Crow lay there groaning till he died"
Fatty Coon was very fond of squirrels.
But at night -- ah ! that was a very different matter.
Fatty thought it great sport to hunt squirrels at night.
Whenever he tried it he usually managed to get a good meal.
He rather thought that some squirrels lived inside that hole.
Fatty Coon 's eyes turned green.
He reached a paw inside the hole and felt all around.
Something had given him a cruel dig.
And in a jiffy Fatty saw what that `` something"
was.
the ragged stranger cried.
`` Please , sir , I never knew it was you ,"
Fatty stammered.
`` Never knew it was me ! Who did you think it was ?"
`` A -- a squirrel !"
Fatty said faintly.
And he whimpered a little , because his paw hurt him.
The tramp coon laughed heartily.
`` You go home ,"
he said to Fatty.
`` And do n't you let me catch you around here again.
You hear ?"
`` Yes , sir !"
Fatty said.
And home he went.
He never went near it again"
`` Oh ! I must n't go near Farmer Green 's house !"
he said.
`` My mother told me to keep away from there.
What time did you say the turkeys go to roost ?"
`` Oh ! they go to roost every night at sundown ,"
Jasper Jay explained.
They 're fast asleep.
And with a hoarse , sneering laugh Jasper Jay flew away.
That was enough for Fatty.
And he wanted a turkey to eat , too.
He said nothing to his mother about Jasper 's news.
Fatty did not intend to make any noise.
And Fatty reached out and seized the nearest one.
But Fatty was not quite quick enough.
Then the next turkey on the limb woke up.
Fatty Coon did not wait to hear anything more.
Farmer Green 's dog Spot was barking now.
And Fatty wanted to climb one of the trees by the roadside.
So he never stopped until he reached the woods.
Then he went nimbly up into the trees.
He never said anything to his mother about Farmer Green 's turkeys.
`` Ha ! ha !"
Jasper Jay only laughed.
Jasper Jay did not like Fatty Coon.
`` Wait till I catch you !"
Fatty said.
But Jasper Jay only laughed harder than ever when Fatty said that.
He seemed to think it was a great joke.
He was most annoying"
Long , long ago there lived , an old man and.
.
`` How delicious that peach must be !"
she said to herself.
`` I must certainly get it and take it home to my old man"
The old woman was delighted.
`` What is the matter ? Why are you so impatient ?"
asked the old man , wondering at her unusual eagerness.
`` Has anything happened while I have been away ?"
`` Oh , no !"
`` That is good ,"
said the old man.
It felt even heavier than before.
`` I did not buy it ,"
answered the old woman.
`` I found it in the river where I was washing"
And she told him the whole story.
`` I am very glad that you have found it.
Let us eat it now , for I am hungry ,"
said the O Fii San.
and out stepped a beautiful little child.
The child spoke again : `` Do n't be afraid.
I am no demon or fairy.
I will tell you the truth.
Heaven has had compassion on you.
On hearing this the old man and his wife were very happy.
I do not know how to thank you enough"
`` Why ,"
and the old man looked bothered.
`` I hope you will be patient with me ,"
`` Then let me go away at once !"
`` Where are you going ?"
`` You must think it strange that I want to go away ,"
said person_0 , `` because I have not yet told you my reason.
This island is the stronghold of a band of devils.
These devils are very hateful beings.
He thought it best to let the boy go.
`` All you say is very interesting , person_0 ,"
said the old man.
`` I will not hinder you in your determination.
You may go if you wish.
`` Thank you , for all your kindness ,"
said person_0 , who began to get ready to go that very day.
He was full of courage and did not know what fear was.
Parting is always sad.
So it was now.
We expect you back victorious !"
But he said `` Good-by !"
quite bravely.
`` I am going now.
Take good care of yourselves while I am away.
Good - by !"
And he stepped quickly out of the house.
In silence the eyes of person_0 and his parents met in farewell.
person_0 now hurried on his way till it was midday.
The dog 's manner at once changed.
said person_0.
`` Thank you !"
said the dog.
`` By the way , I am very very hungry.
Will you give me one of the cakes you are carrying ?"
`` This is the best kind of cake there is in Japan ,"
said person_0.
`` Thank you very much ,"
said the dog , taking the piece thrown to him.
Then person_0 got up and the dog followed.
Will you allow me to go with you ?"
`` Now , do n't quarrel !"
said person_0 , putting himself between them.
`` Wait a moment , dog !"
said the dog.
`` What do you know about it ?"
`` I am a monkey living in these hills ,"
replied the monkey"
Nothing will please me more than to follow you !"
`` Yes , sir ,"
replied the monkey.
`` I admire your courage ,"
said person_0.
`` Here is a piece of one of my fine rice-cakes.
Come along !"
So the monkey joined person_0.
The dog and the monkey did not get on well together.
By and by they came to a large field.
It was the most beautiful bird person_0 had ever seen.
It would certainly make a good fighter.
Surrender at once , and I will take you with me.
I am a miserable bird called a pheasant.
Please allow me to follow you behind the dog and the monkey !"
`` I congratulate you on surrendering so soon ,"
said person_0 , smiling.
`` Come and join us in our raid on the devils"
`` Are you going to take this bird with you also ?"
asked the dog , interrupting.
`` Humph !"
said the dog.
The first thing necessary in an army is harmony.
The one who first begins a quarrel will be discharged on the spot !"
All the three promised not to quarrel.
It will be far better for me to go alone.
I discharge you all at once !"
`` Please , person_0 !"
said the dog.
`` We have come thus far !"
said the monkey.
`` It is inhuman to leave us here !"
said the pheasant.
`` We are not at all afraid of the sea ,"
said the monkey again.
`` Please do take us with you ,"
said the pheasant.
`` Do please ,"
said the dog.
person_0 now got a small ship , and they all got on board.
His three followers watched him , waiting for orders.
said person_0 to the bird , `` for you have good wings.
Fly at once to the castle and engage the demons to fight.
We will follow you"
The pheasant at once obeyed.
Wait till you get a blow from one of our iron bars !"
Very angry , indeed , were the devils.
In the meantime , person_0 had brought his ship to land.
They soon came upon two beautiful damsels washing clothes in a stream.
`` We are captives of the Demon King.
And their tears burst out afresh at this horrible thought.
`` I will rescue you ,"
said person_0.
The chief of the devils at last was the only one left.
`` I am afraid of you ,"
he said meekly.
`` I can not stand against you.
person_0 laughed.
So he decided to take a wife.
All the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned them.
Life seemed to them both like a long summer 's day.
asked the Dragon person_0.
`` It is just as you say !"
said the doctor.
`` Tell me what it is you want for the Queen ?"
demanded Rin Jin.
`` I want the liver of a live monkey !"
answered the doctor.
said the person_0.
said the doctor.
But where are we most likely to find a monkey ?"
asked the person_0.
`` If only you could capture one of these monkeys ?"
said the doctor.
`` How can any of my people capture a monkey ?"
said the Dragon person_0 , greatly puzzled.
`` That has been my difficulty too ,"
said the doctor.
`` Something must be done ,"
Let us send him to the Island of Monkeys to catch one"
`` Well ,"
The only way is to play a trick on one !"
said the perplexed jelly fish.
`` This is what you must do ,"
said the wily chief steward.
said the reluctant jelly fish.
`` You must carry him on your back.
What is the use of your shell if you ca n't do that !"
said the chief steward.
`` Wo n't he be very heavy ?"
queried kurage again.
replied the chief steward.
`` I will do my best then ,"
`` I 'm in luck !"
thought the jelly fish.
So the jelly fish slowly walked towards the pine-tree.
Monkey ? Is n't it a lovely day ?"
`` A very fine day ,"
answered the monkey from the tree.
Where have you come from and what is your name ?"
`` My name is kurage or jelly fish.
I am one of the servants of the Dragon person_0.
answered the jelly fish.
`` I am very glad to see you ,"
said the monkey.
`` By the bye ,"
answered the monkey.
`` Then you ought most surely to come.
said the jelly fish.
`` Is it so beautiful as all that ?"
asked the monkey in astonishment.
`` I have got him at last !"
thought the jelly fish , but aloud he said : `` Mr.
Monkey.
I must now go back.
`` I should love to go ,"
`` There is no difficulty about that.
I can carry you on my back"
`` That will be troubling you too much ,"
said the monkey.
`` I can do it quite easily.
I am stronger than I look , so you need n't hesitate ,"
`` Keep very still , Mr.
monkey ,"
said the jelly fish.
said the monkey.
`` That is the most important thing of all ,"
`` Why is my liver so important to you ?"
asked the monkey.
`` Oh ! you will learn the reason later ,"
said the jelly fish.
said the silly jelly fish.
thought the monkey.
answered the jelly fish.
`` You are quite mistaken ,"
said the monkey.
If I had only guessed of what you were in need.
I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked.
I have several livers.
`` Have you left your liver behind you ?"
asked the jelly fish.
`` Yes ,"
The monkey was of no good without a liver.
Finally the jelly fish stopped and told the monkey so.
`` Well ,"
said the monkey , `` that is soon remedied.
`` But remember your promise !"
pleaded the jelly fish , now very discouraged.
`` That promise was false , and anyhow it is now broken !"
answered the monkey.
added the monkey mockingly from the tree.
Now the day of reckoning had come for the jelly fish.
He quaked all over as he told his story.
The punishment was a horrible one.
But the Dragon person_0 's order had to be obeyed.
`` Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
It sounds up from the `` bell-deep ,"
in the Odense-Au.
and there dwells the old water spirit , the `` Au-mann"
Alban 's.
`` Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
`` Ding-dong ! ding-dong ! Now I 'll retire to rest !"
But the bell got neither rest nor sleep.
-LRB- Illustration : THE AU-MANN LISTENING TO THE BELL.
Alban , the monk mounted up into the tower.
He was young and handsome , but thoughtful exceedingly.
Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
Yes , this was the story the bell told.
Yonder it is cold and wet.
The violent band surrounded the church ; I heard tell of it.
Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
`` Be cautious , cautious , and take good heed to thyself ,"
they both say.
The air knows everything.
`` A funny kind of slip that ,"
said the plants.
And neither thistle nor stinging-nettle would recognize the stranger.
`` That must be a kind of garden plant ,"
said they.
`` Where are you coming ?"
cried the lofty thistles , whose leaves are all armed with thorns.
`` You give yourself a good deal of space.
That 's all nonsense -- we are not here to support you !"
they grumbled.
`` That must be some subordinate species ,"
he said.
`` I do n't know it.
It 's not included in any system"
`` Not included in any system !"
repeated the thistles and the nettles.
There came through the forest a poor innocent girl.
Her heart was pure , and her understanding was enlarged by faith.
But the wonderful plant still bloomed without in the forest.
`` That 's giving itself foreign airs now ,"
said the thistles and the burdocks ; `` we never behave like that here"
And the black snails actually spat at the flower.
Then came the swineherd.
The wonderful plant was placed bodily in his bundle.
`` It shall be made useful ,"
he said ; and so said , so done.
-LRB- Illustration : THE POOR GIRL 'S TREASURE.
He was busy and industrious , but that did him no good.
Its appearance is thus and thus.
It can not be mistaken"
said the swineherd ; `` but I did not know any better"
`` You did n't know any better ! Ignorance of ignorances !"
`` Here is where the plant stood ,"
he said ; `` it is a sacred place"
The botanical professor wrote a long treatise upon the heavenly plant.
And indeed that was the most agreeable part of the whole story.
There was a certain Brahman in a certain village , named Harisarman.
-- and asked him to tell him who had taken away their horse.
And he was sad because he had pretended to have knowledge.
But whatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me"
Secret crimes manifest themselves by means of fear"
Thus thinking , he passed the night happily in the chamber.
It will be much better to test him by some new artifice"
So Harisarman prospered in the world"
The following story is one of the strangest that ever was heard.
At the sight of this I was transported with wonder.
Hear me , O Lord , and grant my request.
`` Dear prince ,"
Nor will I pretend to have any power over your actions.
They did the same to the prince , who was drowned.
.
I sat up and asked her who she was.
' I was forced to promise that I would obey her order.
For many months I whipped them every night , though with regret.
It was in the month of May.
It was charming to behold.
`` Poor despised herbs !"
said the apple branch.
or `` dog-flower"
`` Poor despised plants !"
said the apple branch.
`` A difference ?"
What is the despised plant that you especially pity ?"
`` The dandelion ,"
replied the apple branch.
`` Do you see ?"
said the sunbeam.
`` Yes , over children ,"
replied the apple branch.
`` But beauty is a higher thing !"
said the apple tree branch.
`` Yes , yes , that is your opinion ,"
the apple branch persisted.
`` Look , with what singular beauty Providence has invested it ,"
she said.
`` Alas !"
`` What will you give me ,"
said the manikin , `` if I do it for you ?"
`` My necklace ,"
said the girl.
`` The ring on my finger ,"
answered the girl.
`` Even if she be a miller 's daughter ,"
`` I have nothing left that I could give ,"
answered the girl.
`` Then promise me , if you should become Queen , your first child"
`` Who knows whether that will ever happen ?"
`` I will give you three days ' time ,"
`` Perhaps your name is Shortribs , or Sheepshanks , or Laceleg ?"
but he always answered , `` That is not my name"
Ha ! glad am I that no one knew That Rumpelstiltskin I am styled"
at first she said , `` Is your name Conrad ?"
`` No"
`` Is your name Harry ?"
`` No"
`` Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin ?"
In this way life is endurable"
I have already had several injuries of that kind"
I have no fancy for killing myself with work"
I lay down by them and slept too.
The eleventh said , `` I gave up my place yesterday.
There was no end of it all day long.
Some one had come by , who had carried all off.
I left it standing , and stretched myself on the straw again.
`` Now , dear John ,"
`` No , master ,"
`` Then what hast thou looked for , John ?"
`` Something better , and that luckily I have found"
`` What is that , John ?"
`` Three blackbirds ,"
answered the boy.
`` And where are they ?"
asked the master.
answered the wise boy.
`` How can you dispute about an old cap ?"
said the youth.
`` Give me the cap ,"
But how shocked he was when he saw her.
cried he.
`` Ah ,"
Ah ,"
`` Nothing can keep me from doing it ,"
said he , `` but tell me what I must do"
`` Thou shalt know everything ,"
With this canst thou likewise give back to thy brothers their human form"
There belonged to this king an island named Cassel.
I acquainted him with the whole story.
My family and I received one another with transports of sincere friendship.
`` Why have you come here ?"
he asked.
`` No , no ,"
said the woman.
There is not a grain of rice left in the house"
`` O Bhagawant !"
exclaimed the Brahman.
`` Here , take this ,"
You will see that he will give you a lac of rupees for it"
Thus saying he dismissed her , and the woman left.
The poor Brahmani was very thankful.
He thought his father would applaud the act.
But it was not so.
The prince accepted the invitation , and was treated like a prince.
`` Ah !"
I will not sleep to-night"
But he rose up and spoke.
`` Do not slay me ,"
he said.
`` What man ? What dog ?"
he asked.
`` I will tell you ,"
said the prince , `` if you will give me that sword"
There was hardly ten rupees ' worth left in the place.
The merchant himself nearly went mad.
Nothing was missing.
There was everything just as the thieves had taken them.
`` The merchant was very glad.
Thus there will be an end of my debt.
' `` No dog , no loan.
The merchant picked it up and read it.
The prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law.
So he sent to him.
Then the king took his wife and brought her to the jogi.
But he knew that the second bit of advice was true.
`` O fool ,"
`` Do not bother me ,"
said the potter.
`` What does it matter to you ?"
`` Pardon me ,"
said the prince , `` but I should like to know the reason"
`` The reason is this , then ,"
said the potter.
What can we do ?"
`` Truly a matter for laughing and weeping.
But weep no more ,"
said the prince.
Only give me suitable garments , and prepare me for the occasion"
At night he was conducted to the apartment of the princess.
`` Dread hour !"
`` Surely ,"
`` Where do you come from ? Who are you ?"
asked the king , entering the room.
`` O king !"
`` Let him come in ,"
He tried everything he could think of.
But it was all of no use.
He thought that he must die of fright.
The more he looked , the greater was his astonishment.
All had horns growing on their foreheads.
So he picked himself up and crept back into the tree.
`` What are these creatures doing ?"
said the old man to himself.
`` I will look out , it sounds very amusing"
It made the old man laugh to see their strange antics.
`` How amusing this is !"
I am tired of watching it.
said the old fellow to himself.
`` How strange !"
exclaimed the horned chief.
`` I never saw such a skillful dancer before ! He dances admirably !"
Now give us the pleasure of drinking a cup of wine with us ,"
and with these words he handed him his largest wine-cup.
I fear I have only disturbed your pleasant party by my unskillful dancing"
`` No , no ,"
answered the big demon.
`` You must come often and dance for us.
Your skill has given us much pleasure"
The old man thanked him again and promised to do so.
`` Then will you come again to-morrow , old man ?"
asked the demon.
`` Certainly , I will ,"
answered the old man.
`` Then you must leave some pledge of your word with us ,"
said the demon.
`` Whatever you like ,"
said the old man.
asked the demon , looking round.
I see the old man has a wen on his right cheek.
Now mortal men consider such a wen very fortunate.
`` You are very clever ,"
said the demon chief , giving his horns an approving nod.
The old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened.
He hardly knew for some time where he was.
Here he hid himself and waited for the twilight.
Why does n't he come ?"
`` Ah , you are the old man of yesterday ,"
said the demon chief.
`` Thank you for coming , you must dance for us soon"
We do n't wish to see any more of such dancing.
We will give you back the pledge you left with us.
You must go away at once"
-- `` Yes , Blessed One ,"
he replied.
And he told a story of long ago.
`` Who shall be my teacher ?"
the lad asked.
Take this , and give it him for a fee"
And they tried to stop him.
When he reached mid-forest the Demon showed himself.
`` Where are you going ?"
he shouted.
`` Stop ! You 'll make a meal for me !"
Said the Bodhisatta : `` Demon , I came here trusting in myself.
I advise you to be careful how you come near me.
The arrow stuck fast in the Demon 's hair.
`` You , Demon !"
This day will I pound you and grind you to powder !"
and his head stuck fast like the rest.
Now , why is it that he does not fear ?"
`` Why should I fear , Demon ?"
replied he.
`` In one life a man can die but once.
That is why I fear nothing"
I 'll let him go !"
Go back to the company of your friends and relations !"
_"
`` What strange thing is this ?"
said the King.
`` Ah , no !"
said the farmer , `` no luck-child am I.
The other agreed to this , and accompanied him without suspicion.
At last he said , `` Who calls me ?"
and was about to get into the sack.
`` Halt !"
said the other , `` that wo n't do ,"
Keep perfectly quiet until thou becomest wiser"
In hopes the wily spark to trap that night.
Remember , cried the wife , to make them like.
Leave that to me , said he , I 'll justly strike.
`` It was in a little provincial town ,"
I saw it quite plainly.
I saw it all ,"
said the Moon.
It was a charming sight to behold.
' And then the bear leader came running up"
`` I knew an old maid ,"
said the Moon.
Our family vault is six miles from here.
' Last night a van stopped at the house.
They placed straw round the coffin , and the van drove away.
On the high-road the pace was quicker yet.
Long , long ago there lived in Kyoto a brave soldier named Kintoki.
Now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her.
She called him person_0 or the Golden Boy.
and his mother the `` Old Nurse of the Mountains ,"
for they did not know her high rank.
Great was the fun they all had together.
person_0 said , `` Here is a place for a good game.
What do you all say to a wrestling match ?"
said she.
`` All right ,"
I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round"
`` What fun ! we shall all try to get the prize ,"
said the bear.
Now , Mr.
Deer , you are to be umpire !"
`` He , he !"
answered the deer.
`` I will be umpire.
Now , Mr.
Monkey and Mr.
`` Are you ready ?"
`` Red-back ! Red-back ! stand your ground !"
called out the deer.
grunted the bear.
The hare at last gained on the monkey.
for he felt that he had not been fairly beaten.
My foot slipped and I tumbled.
Then person_0 consenting , the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again.
This he soon managed to do.
The bear came forward as umpire.
Now , we will all go home.
Come along !"
So saying , person_0 led the way while the animals followed.
Bridge there was none.
The river rushed `` don , don"
on its way.
person_0 , however , said : `` Wait a moment.
I will make a good bridge for you all in a few minutes"
`` There ,"
and he stepped across first.
The four animals followed.
He watched with great surprise person_0 and his animal companions.
He hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them.
`` O , Kimbo !"
`` How late you are to-day.
I feared that something had happened to you.
Where have you been all the time ?"
`` Now tell me who is the strongest of all ?"
asked his mother , pretending not to know.
`` Oh , mother ,"
`` But next to you then , who is the strongest ?"
`` The bear comes next to me in strength ,"
answered person_0.
`` And after the bear ?"
asked his mother again.
said person_0.
Suddenly person_0 and his mother were startled by a voice from outside.
He would like to join the sport too !"
It was the old woodcutter who had followed person_0 from the river.
He slipped off his clogs and entered the cottage.
Yama-uba and her son were both taken by surprise.
`` Who are you ?"
they both exclaimed.
At last the old man desisted , declaring it a drawn game.
`` You are , indeed , a very strong child.
said the woodcutter.
Hardly able to believe what I saw I followed you home.
It is a pity that you are hidden away in these wild mountains"
`` You are very kind to take so much interest in my son"
`` You need not trouble yourself about that.
By good fortune , I have thus unexpectedly come across your son.
What do you say to this ?"
Long , long ago.
Now the hare wanted very much to cross over to Inaba.
`` This is very lucky !"
thought the hare.
`` Now I shall be able to get my wish.
I will ask the crocodile to carry me across the sea !"
But he was doubtful whether the crocodile would consent to do what wanted.
Crocodile , is n't it a lovely day ?"
Hare ? You must be very lonely all by yourself !"
`` Oh , no , I am not at all lonely ,"
Wo n't you stop and play with me a little while ?"
Then the hare said : `` Mr.
`` Of course , there are more crocodiles than hares ,"
answered the crocodile.
The crocodile was very conceited.
`` Then do try ,"
The crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time.
The hare , meanwhile , waited patiently on the shore.
`` Look , Mr.
Hare !"
Did you ever see so many crocodiles ?"
One , two , three , four , five , six.
seven , eight , nine --"
Thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of Inaba.
And he was just about to run away as fast as he could.
So some of them ran after the hare and caught him.
Now one of these young men had a bad and spiteful disposition.
Then all the young men passed on.
Who can have treated you so cruelly ?"
`` I know ,"
`` Then I will tell you of a good remedy ,"
said the man.
Please tell me who you are ?"
`` I am no King 's son as you think me.
I am a fairy , and my name is Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto ,"
`` Oh , I did not know that you were Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto.
He found them just entering the Princess 's gate.
and so they were married.
This is the end of the story.
But what became of the crocodiles nobody knows"
So the messengers came home as they went.
Allerleirauh lived there for a long time in great wretchedness.
Then he ordered the cook to appear before him.
The King said , `` Go and bid it come up here"
When Allerleirauh came , the King said , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am a poor girl who no longer has any father or mother"
He asked further , `` Of what use art thou in my palace ?"
She answered , `` I know nothing about the ring"
The King clutched the mantle and tore it off.
Thereupon the marriage was solemnized , and they lived happily until their death"
He exclaimed with joy : `` Oh.
surely that is some cottage where I can get a night 's lodging !"
`` I am very sorry for you.
`` Oh , that does not matter ,"
And in this way he pressed the old woman to let him stay.
The pilgrim was only too glad to do as he was told.
He took off his sandals and entered the hut.
`` You must be hungry after your long tramp ,"
said the old woman.
`` I will go and cook some supper for you"
She then went to the kitchen to cook some rice.
`` I see you are cold ,"
You must stay and take care of the house while I am gone"
`` No , no ,"
Then she left him and went out.
Now mind what I tell you !"
said the priest , rather bewildered.
aroused his curiosity and his fear.
He got up and began to move slowly towards the back room.
He must find out.
I will just have a peep before she comes back ,"
said the man to himself.
With trembling hands he pushed back the sliding door and looked in.
What he saw froze the blood in his veins.
The sickening smell made him faint.
`` How horrible !"
he cried out.
He ran on , redoubling his speed , pretending not to hear.
Now in a certain place there lived a Brahman named Haridatta.
That 's why my farming is in vain.
I will at once go and pay my respects to it"
And he laid the milk down and went to his house.
From this time forward friendship between us is impossible.
So speaking , it gave the Brahman a costly pearl and disappeared.
But before it went away it said : `` Come back no more"
.
Just hear what the wind can tell.
says the person_0.
The tapestries were gorgeous , the furniture was expensive and artistically carved.
Black fiery horses neighed in the stables.
`` Huh -- sh ! roar along !"
said the person_0.
the person_0 continued.
`` I lay quite quiet ,"
They rode that summer through all the villages round about.
But in the night , when I rose again ,"
`` Waldemar Daa stood for a space silent and thoughtful.
said the person_0.
Crows and ravens croaked aloud as if in scorn.
Therefore the tree with the black stork 's nest was left standing.
The tree was not worth speaking of.
`` I heard all that ,"
said the person_0.
Certainly I did my part towards teaching it seamanship.
`` Her sister was bright and slender as a lily.
They were handsome women.
That was no secret , and many opinions were expressed concerning it.
In his chimney there was fire even in summer time.
Yes , I was there too ,"
said the person_0.
`` Empty grew the barns and store-rooms , the cellars and magazines.
The servants decreased in number , and the mice multiplied.
said the person_0"
`` I blew through the courtyard-gate like a watchman blowing his horn ,"
the person_0 went on , `` but no watchman was there.
The lordly life had changed to a life of penury.
I was the only one who rejoiced aloud in that castle ,"
said the person_0.
It was a biting frost.
` After winter comes spring , ' he said.
` Thou cunning little weaver , thou dost teach me perseverance.
' `` It was the morning of Easter-day.
The lamp was burnt out , but he did not notice it.
Owe Rainel did not like staying there.
I listened to hear what occurred.
-LRB- Illustration : LEAVING THE OLD HOME.
And forth they went to the far-off land.
`` Daa and his daughters could not help hearing it.
She lived longer than the rest ; she knew all.
said the person_0.
She remembered all that right well , did Anna Dorothea"
` Oh ! oh ! '"
Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant.
`` I took pity on the fairest of the sisters ,"
said the person_0.
said the person_0.
`` There was no window , only a hole in the wall.
`` The stork covered her hut till her death.
I sang at her grave !"
said the person_0.
Tell it better , any of you , if you know how ,"
said the person_0 , and turned away -- and he was gone"
Mrs.
So Mrs.
Coon decided to take him with her.
The hunting was not very good.
person_0 wished that it was summertime.
That was enough for person_0.
He scrambled up the nearest tree.
For he knew that his mother had discovered danger of some sort.
Mrs.
Coon followed close behind person_0.
And they had.
And as Mrs.
`` What 's the matter ?"
he asked , as soon as Johnnie Green was out of sight.
`` His cap !"
Mrs.
Coon exclaimed.
`` He is wearing a coon-skin cap !"
she warned person_0.
`` No , indeed , Mother !"
We shall see how well person_0 remembered.
That very afternoon person_0 Coon heard some very pleasant news.
It was Jasper Jay who told him.
He was a very noisy fellow.
said Jasper Jay"
The false step-mother thought , `` This is a good opportunity ,"
Then said he , `` Be easy , I will not kill thee ,"
She had about seven thousand cages of rare birds in the castle.
`` Take care ,"
said Joringel , `` that you do not go too near the castle"
The sun was still half above the mountain and half set.
He was horror-stricken and filled with deadly fear.
Joringel looked for Jorinda.
The sun had now set.
Then Joringel was freed.
Day and night he journeyed with this flower to the castle.
At last he heard it.
`` Just go , Frederick ,"
answered Kate , `` just go , I will have all ready for you"
Well thought of"
`` What 's gone is gone !"
As soon as Kate was on the steps she saw the mischance.
`` Good gracious !"
she cried.
`` What shall I do now to stop Frederick knowing it !"
`` Yes ,"
`` It is all right ,"
and she strewed the meal over the whole cellar.
`` Ah , Freddy ,"
`` Yellow counters , why not ? But just let us see them"
I am not allowed to go there"
The rogues went thither , dug and found pure gold.
`` Ah , wife ,"
`` Indeed , Frederick ,"
`` Come , then ,"
`` Yes , Frederick , I will take them"
`` It is to my advantage ,"
`` There one can see ,"
So she took another cheese and rolled it down.
But the fourth did no better than the third.
`` Now just let us have what you have brought with you ,"
said he.
She gave him the dry bread.
`` Where have you the butter and the cheeses ?"
asked the man.
`` Ah , Freddy ,"
`` Really , Frederick , you should have told me"
`` No , Frederick , you should have told me to do it before"
I will wait here for you"
`` Oh , heavens ,"
Frederick got down on the other side and collected some stones together.
`` No , Catherine , not now ,"
he replied , `` they might betray us"
`` Do it , then , and be hanged !"
`` No , Catherine , you must not , it might betray us"
`` Then do it and be hanged !"
So she emptied out the vinegar , and it besprinkled the robbers.
They said amongst themselves , `` The dew is already falling"
and said , `` Frederick , I must throw the door down"
`` No , not now , Catherine , it might discover us"
`` Oh , but , Frederick , I must.
It weighs me down far too much"
`` Oh , no , Catherine , do hold it fast"
`` Ah , Frederick , I am letting it fall !"
`` Let it go , then , in the devil 's name"
and they ran away and left everything behind them.
`` What is the matter ?"
`` I should very much like to know if Catherine is in ?"
`` Yes , yes ,"
replied Frederick , `` she must be in and asleep"
Said she ,"
` Tis well , then I am certainly at home already ,"
and ran away.
Outside Catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal.
and wished themselves once more rid of Catherine.
Go there and pull up some turnips for us"
Pastor , the devil is in your turnip-ground , rooting up turnips"
`` Ah , heavens ,"
Said the man , `` Then I will carry you on my back ,"
and he carried him out on his back.
`` Ah , the devil !"
Seven Swabians were once together.
`` Hark ! hark !"
cried he to his comrades , `` Good heavens ! I hear a drum"
`` Oh dear ! Oh dear !"
screamed Master Schulz.
`` Take me prisoner ; I surrender ! I surrender !"
Then they journeyed onwards.
Boldly ventured , is half won ,"
Hereupon they all together set on the dragon.
in the greatest anguish.
This awakened the hare , which in great alarm darted swiftly away.
in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves.
It costs them scarcely any thing , we find.
But when four months had passed , the fair-one showed.
Sorely vexed She was , and he still more perplexed.
Bread butterless , a sanded floor , It seemed no better.
And thus it came about.
`` What 's the use ;"
`` If you will please me ,"
This is not strange.
A flea is in her ear , ` tis said.
The morning broke.
Of fleas and heat Kitty complained.
she said ,"
Ready consent The simple mother gave , and went To seek her spouse.
`` Wife ,"
`` She must remain.
No doubt to-night `` Will fresher be.
`` Is she more delicate than me ?"
`` Our Kate `` To me seems greatly changed of late.
`` You are unkind ,"
she said to him , `` To thwart her simple , girlish whim.
`` Pray cease ,"
the husband cried , `` to scold `` And take your whim.
`` Her belly-full our Kate may get `` Of nightingale or of linnet"
The thing was settled.
To understand there 's but one way -- Experience.
`` I 'll see the influence ,"
he said , `` Of nightingale and change of bed"
Excessive heat had made all clothes Unbearable.
The mother almost wept for glee.
`` A nightingale , oh ! let me see.
Despite his grief the good man smiled.
`` Much more than you expect you 'll see.
Who was surprised ? It was the dame.
`` For their good offices I wait `` To set this nasty matter straight"
`` All will go well ,"
They left the happy couple there.
Adam dug up the land , and Eve span.
Then she brought in her children , but only the beautiful ones.
Adam opened the door respectfully , and the Heavenly Father entered.

It was a bug , or a huge fly.
So he lost no time.
He put it into his mouth , when the strangest thing happened.
Fatty felt himself pulled right over into the water.
And all the time Fatty was being dragged along through the water.
He began to be frightened.
At least , that was what Fatty Coon thought.
And he swam quickly to the bank and scampered into the bushes.
Now , this was what really happened.
Farmer Green had come up the brook to catch trout.
But Fatty Coon did n't laugh at all.
His mouth was too sore ; and he was too frightened.
But he was very , very glad that the strange bug had flown away"
It is more than a hundred years ago.
`` Everything in its place ,"
he cried ; `` into the puddle with you !"
`` Everything in its right place ,"
for my lord the baron , and my lord 's whole family.
`` Everything in its right place !"
`` The open high-road is my right place ,"
he said ; `` I did not feel at all happy there"
But from that hour no more card-playing was permitted there.
`` That is bad reading ,"
It was a good thing now to be in the old mansion.
Where rectitude enters in , prosperity is sure to follow.
`` That is our genealogical tree ,"
And a hundred years rolled by.
It was in our own time.
A field-path led close by the old tree.
All things here corresponded with each other.
The motto was still `` Everything in its right place ;"
`` But they did not properly belong to our family ,"
said one of the little barons.
`` He was a dealer , and she had kept the geese.
They were not like papa and mamma"
The son of the neighbouring clergyman was tutor in the great house.
and the flowers formed a pretty whole.
The party came to a halt at the old willow tree.
Accordingly the tutor broke off a branch.
`` Oh , do n't do that !"
cried the young baroness ; but it was done already.
`` That is our famous old tree ,"
she continued , `` and I love it dearly.
There is a story attached to this tree"
`` They would not be ennobled , the good old folks !"
she said.
`` They were charming , sensible people ,"
In the higher classes many beautiful and kindly traits are found.
This was the speech of the clergyman 's son.
At the castle there was a great company.
Many guests came from the neighborhood and from the capital.
That should command , and should have the place of honor !"
`` No indeed ,"
`` Everything in its right place"
`` Everything in its right place"

To-night I can draw no picture of the memories of thy visit.
Then the soldier said , `` I am hungry , but have no money"
Then he told him what he had to do.
The soldier said , `` Good , I will take care"
`` Aha , old bird !"
And he fetched the bellows and made hell-fire blaze right under him.
`` Yes ,"
`` I should never have expected that ,"
said he , and was well pleased , and entered the town.
He called to him and asked , `` Whence comest thou ?"
`` From hell"
`` Who art thou ?"
`` The Devil 's sooty brother , and my King as well"
`` What are you doing there ?"
asked the father.
`` I am making a little trough ,"
The mother was afraid when she heard that , and wept no more.
`` Yes ,"

In , fact it was the MOON that looked in upon me.
This promise he has faithfully kept.

ONE morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.
A gig was coming along the road ; it was driven by person_0.
McGregor , and beside him sat person_0s.
McGregor in her best bonnet.
McGregor 's garden.
Old person_0s.
LITTLE Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.
PETER was sitting by himself.
He looked poorly , and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.
`` Peter ,"
PETER replied -- `` The scarecrow in person_0.
McGregor 's garden ,"
Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin , and assured him that person_0.
McGregor had gone out in a gig , and person_0s.
PETER said he hoped that it would rain.
At this point , old person_0s.
From here they looked down into person_0.
McGregor 's garden.
McGregor 's.
IT had been sown with lettuces.
They took them off the scarecrow.
-LRB- The name of little Benjamin 's papa was old person_0.
Benjamin Bunny.
-RRB- The lettuces certainly were very fine.
Presently he dropped half the onions.
He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden.
PRESENTLY Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.
SHE sat there for FIVE HOURS.
The cat looked up and saw old person_0.
He was looking for his son.
OLD person_0.
Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.
The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
WHEN old person_0.
Then he took out his nephew Peter.
When person_0.
Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket - handkerchief , and old person_0s.
The End"
replied prudent Timothy.
EVERY day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts.
said Goody.
`` I shall be much thinner before spring-time , my love ,"
said person_0 , peeping into the hole.
The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail.
He began to dig , and he could not remember.
There were several sorts of little birds , twittering different songs.
THE squirrels followed and listened.
The hole was much too small for person_0 ' figure.
`` We will leave him here till he confesses ,"
He lay quite stunned and still.
GOODY TIPTOES picked up the nut bags and went home.
Goody person_1 passed a lonely and unhappy night.
IN the meantime person_0 came to his senses.
person_0 coughed and groaned , because his ribs hurted him.
It laughed and chuckled when it heard person_0 's story.
said the Chipmunk.
What is the explanation of these showers of nuts ?"
said Mrs.
`` I know where Chippy is ; a little bird told me ,"
said Mrs.
Chippy Hackee.
`` You could squeeze in , through that little round hole ,"
said Goody person_1.
`` Yes , I could ,"
said the Chipmunk , `` but my husband , Chippy Hackee , bites !"
Then person_0 came out , and went home with an umbrella.
AT last a large bear came walking through the wood.
But nobody ever answers ! The End"
`` NOW , my dears ,"
said old Mrs.
McGregor"
`` NOW run along , and do n't get into mischief.
I am going out"
THEN old Mrs.
Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella , to the baker 's.
She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
McGregor ! MR.
It was a blue jacket with brass buttons , quite new.
MR.
AND rushed into the toolshed , and jumped into a can.
MR.
He began to turn them over carefully , looking under each.
Presently Peter sneezed -- `` Kertyschoo !"
Mr.
The window was too small for Mr.
McGregor , and he was tired of running after Peter.
He went back to his work.
Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.
She only shook her head at him.
Peter began to cry.
Presently , he came to a pond where Mr.
McGregor filled his water-cans.
Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.
The first thing he saw was Mr.
McGregor hoeing onions.

The End"
Tom Thumb was a mouse.
THE doll 's house stood at the other side of the fireplace.
Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearth-rug.
They pushed the front door -- it was not fast.
It was a beautiful shiny yellow , streaked with red.
`` It is not boiled enough ; it is hard.
You have a try , Hunca Munca"
`` It 's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger 's ,"
said Hunca Munca.
`` Let it alone ,"
said Tom Thumb ; `` give me some fish , Hunca Munca !"
Then Tom Thumb lost his temper.
She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser , labeled `` Rice ,"
`` Coffee"
`` Sago"
But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind.
The bookcase and the bird-cage refused to go into the mouse-hole.
BUT the nurse said : `` I will set a mouse-trap !"
SO that is the story of the two Bad Mice.
For many many weeks there would now be a long night.
-- others only containing room enough to hold two or four men.
Before long some one knocked.
replied a smooth voice.
`` Honest indeed ,"
Thou wilt not get into heaven.
The Lord hath forbidden me to let any one in while he is out"
`` Come , do be merciful ,"
cried the tailor.
Then he asked if he had let anyone come in.
`` I know of no one who has been here ,"
`` Oh , thou knave ,"
Then go where thou wilt.
No one shall give punishment here , but I alone , the Lord"

` Those are glorious trees ! ' said the first.
The stage coach went rattling past.
All the passengers were asleep at this beautiful spot.
It sounds well here.
Then two young fellows came gallopping up on horseback.
A carriage rolled by.
Six people were sitting in it.
' `` Now came a painter.
He spoke not a word , but his eyes sparkled.
He began to whistle.
At this the nightingales sang louder than ever.
` That will make a beautiful picture , ' he said.
And last of all came a poor girl.
My rays followed her till the morning dawn kissed her brow"
The air was clear again.
Again he gave me an outline for a sketch.
Listen to what he told me.
The blooming lychnis exhaled sweet odours.
The crown-shaped Northern Light burned fiercely in the sky.
`` And now a Court of Judgment was opened.
`` THERE 'S one of my pocket-handkins !"
cried person_0 -- `` and there 's my pinny !"
Mrs.
`` Oh that IS lovely !"
said person_0.
`` AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves ?"
said Mrs.
Tiggy - winkle.
`` There 's another one of mine ,"
said person_0.
`` WHAT are those funny little white things ?"
`` There 's my last pocket - handkin !"
said person_0.
`` AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch ?"
said Mrs.
Tiggy-winkle.
`` WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things ?"
said person_0.
`` Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl"
`` Will their jackets take off ?"
asked Lucy.
They 're ALWAYS marked at washing !"
said Mrs.
Tiggy - winkle.
Mrs.
THEN away down the hill trotted person_0 and Mrs.
Tiggy-winkle.
and to thank the washer-woman -- But what a VERY odd thing ! Mrs.
Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG.

IT is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is `` soporific"
SOMETIMES Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.

MR.
McGREGOR 'S rubbish heap was a mixture.
into flower.
THE Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces.
Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children.
THE little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun.
-RRB- SHE rustled across the paper bag , and awakened Benjamin Bunny.
The mouse apologized profusely , and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.
The mouse hid in a jam pot.

Mcperson_0 looked down after emptying his sack.
He stared at them for some time.
PRESENTLY a fly settled on one of them and it moved.
person_1.
said he as he dropped them into his sack.
MR.
McGREGOR tied up the sack and left it on the wall.
He went to put away the mowing machine.
WHILE he was gone , person_1s.
But person_1s.
Tittlemouse was a resourceful person.
She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.
THE little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.
THEN they all hid under a bush and watched for person_1.
Mcperson_0.
MR.
He carried it hanging down , as if it were rather heavy.
The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.
THEY watched him go into his house.
And then they crept up to the window to listen.
MR.
said person_1.
Mcperson_0.
`` EH ? What 's that ? What have they been spoiling now ?"
enquired person_1s.
Mcperson_0.
repeated person_1.
Mcperson_0 , counting on his fingers -- `` one , two , three --"

Mcperson_0.
-LRB- The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.
-RRB- MRS.
McGREGOR took hold of the sack and felt it.
`` Line your old cloak ?"
shouted person_1.
Mcperson_0 -- `` I shall sell them and buy myself baccy !"
`` Rabbit tobacco ! I shall skin them and cut off their heads"
MRS.
McGREGOR untied the sack and put her hand inside.
When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry.
She said that person_1.
Mcperson_0 had `` done it a purpose"
AND person_1.
Mcperson_0 was very angry too.
It was rather hurt.
THEN Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.
SO person_1.
Mcperson_0 did not get his tobacco , and person_1s.
Mcperson_0 did not get her rabbit skins.
The End"
There is nothing else to be done"
I have often heard tell of his wisdom.
I will go and try"
There was no time to lose.
`` Good Mr.
Boar , I have heard of your excellent wisdom.
I am in great trouble , you alone can help me.
The boar was pleased at the flattery and determined to help the monkey.
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the monkey , `` he has one infant son"
`` What then ?"
said the monkey.
The monkey thanked the boar many times and then went home.
His life depended on whether the boar 's plan succeeded or not.
Then all happened as the boar had planned.
`` There !"
said the wife.
`` You are right , wife , for once ,"
said the man as he carried the child into the house.
St.
It was an old state carriage.
`` Humph ! humph !"
`` The beautiful has departed ,"
it sighed -- or at least it might have done so.
We came back in autumn.
The coach was there still , but the pigs were gone.
They were playing the grand lords out in the woods.
-LRB- Illustration : THE PIGS AT HOME IN THE OLD STATE COACH.
and the majority is always right.
They found the place so inexpressibly lovely ! `` Oui ! oui !"
they all exclaimed.
The old ones put their heads together.
`` Umph !"
`` Oui ! oui !"
chimed in all the rest.
she said.
`` Good ! good !"
`` Gone ! gone !"
sighed the rose king.
`` All the beautiful is gone !"
`` There is always somebody who has a soul for the beautiful !"
she said"
The weather was still mild and warm.
But they were not talking about this.
It was , in fact , an old gravestone.
`` Yes ,"
-LRB- Illustration : PREBEN SCHWANE AND HIS WIFE MARTHA.
They were an honest old couple.
I can remember them from the days of my boyhood.
Every one knew them , and every one esteemed them.
They were the oldest pair here in the town.
Time passes away , and all things change.
No one thinks of them any more"
And the old man who had told all this shook his head scornfully.
`` Forgotten ! Everything will be forgotten !"
he said.
`` Forgotten ! Everything will be forgotten !"
was repeated in the room.
Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say , `` Mr.
Burgomaster ,"
should be put to death on the gallows.
Then he was caught up , and was instantly in East India.
She said she was happy , for now she had conquered.
`` Now I am in the house of God ,"
she said , `` and in that house we are happy"
Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister.
In this way she will be delayed.
Then after a while the water began slowly to rise.
The instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it.
Of the latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated.
He said , `` No.
.
But from to-day , you and I are one"
So they began lovingly to hold converse with each other.
And that was all the revenge she took"
He was astounded , and knew not what to say to it.
The man said , `` I shall be very glad to do it ;"
Then they danced and skipped and leapt over chairs and benches.
At last they danced out of doors.
At last she set out on her way home.
The woman did everything that her neighbor bade her.
And he began to laugh at it.
`` I saw a little girl weeping ,"
She had received a most beautiful doll as a present.
' And she looked up at the doll.
`` For heaven 's sake just go in peace ,"
answered the woman , `` I will manage that"
`` You , indeed ,"
said the man.
And having said that , the man went on his way.
I will take the beasts away with me at once"
`` True ,"
`` Where is the money ?"
asked the peasant.
`` Oh , I have not got the money ,"
`` What kind of security ?"
asked the man.
`` What do you want , my friend ?"
`` I have fallen down from heaven ,"
`` No ,"
You must have seen him ?"
`` Who would have thought it ?"
You will be so kind as to take it with you"
`` That wo n't do very well ,"
`` Then hark you ,"
`` If you ca n't manage it any other way ,"
said the peasant , `` I will do you that favor"
`` Just sit still where you are ,"
The son was full of astonishment.
`` Mother ,"
He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed.
`` Have you seen the man who has fallen down from Heaven ?"
cried the youth to him.
`` Yes ,"
`` Alas ,"
`` Aha !"
`` Why should I not do you this favor ?"
`` Thou hast done well ,"
So thought the peasant , but you no doubt prefer the simple folks"
it ceased to cook.
`` Oh , yes ,"
Do not go in"
`` Why not ?"
asked the King 's son.
`` Good evening ,"
growled she , and pretended to be quite friendly.
`` Take a seat and rest yourselves"
They slept quietly until early morning.
`` Take that to your master ,"
said she.
`` Who knows whether we shall find anything better to-day ?"
By nightfall they found an inn and entered it.
Then he went to her and laid his riddle before her.
`` What is this ?"
said he , `` One slew none , and yet slew twelve"
Then she asked , `` One slew none , what is that ?"
She inquired further , `` And yet slew twelve , what is that ?"
The judges said , `` Bring us a proof of this"
`` Well ,"
`` What ,"
and threw all the money into the water to them.
and besides that , did not throw the money out again.
after him till he went home quite angry.
The dog , however , answered nothing but `` wow , wow"
`` Wow , wow , wow ,"
said the dog.
and was quite delighted.
But no one would come and pay it.
`` There is no trusting any one now ,"
Then the butcher grew angry , snatched a broomstick and drove him out.
`` Wait a while ,"
said the peasant , `` there is still some justice in the world !"
and went to the royal palace and begged for an audience.
`` Alas !"
and he related at full length all that had happened.
Thou mayst thank God for thy good fortune !"
`` Oh ,"
Then the King grew angry , and said , `` Thou art a boor"
`` Ah , Lord King ,"
`` Stop ,"
answered the King , `` thou shalt have another reward.
`` Yes , that is what I think ,"
answered the peasant ; `` five hundred are to be counted out to me"
`` Hark thee ,"
said the soldier , `` give me some of it.
What canst thou do with all that money ?"
`` As it is thou ,"
`` Jew ,"
`` Pull his coat off ,"
said the latter , `` and he shall have his five hundred"
`` Ah !"
Afterwards he went to an inn and counted out his money.
`` Good heavens !"
`` I know what 's right better than that ,"
answered the peasant , `` I shall have a new coat made first.
What will people not do for love !"
`` Ah ,"
`` What is that ?"
shrieked the Jew.
`` Ah , ha , just in time !"
said the barber.
`` Well done !"
said the old man.
`` Now you shall see what I can do , father ,"
`` You are a fine fellow , and as clever as your brother ,"
`` Yesterday ,"
began the Moon , `` I looked down upon the turmoil of Paris.
My eye penetrated into an apartment of the Louvre.
I think she was actually weeping"
Died ! ' mournfully repeated the old woman.
The people stormed the Tuileries.
Even women and children were to be found among the combatants.
They penetrated into the apartments and halls of the palace.
Mortally wounded with several bayonet thrusts , he sank down.
This happened in the throne-room.
It was more than a fortnight since the Moon had shone.
Hear what the Moon told me.
`` From a town in Fezzan I followed a caravan.
`` For many nights I followed the train.
At home the beautiful wife prayed for her husband and her father.
Now the desert lies behind them.
He raises his head , and --"
I heard nothing more from him this evening"
`` It is indeed a heavy burden ,"
How can one have any rest , or peace of one 's life ?"
`` I know what I will do ,"
The parents did not reflect long.
`` Birds of a feather , flock together ,"
they thought , and consented.
But fat Trina was no less idle.
`` Dear Harry ,"
`` Thou hast spoken like a sensible woman ,"
replied Harry.
The neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats.
Lazy Harry did not like to leave his bed before noon.
`` He who rises early ,"
said he , `` wastes his substance"
`` But ,"
`` Dost thou think ,"
`` Oh ,"
Look , Harry ,"
`` There lie the goose and the young gosling ,"
said Harry , `` and want no looking after.
We have all reason to be satisfied with our lot"
`` Yes ,"
'"
`` I am already aged ,"
`` Look !"
answered he.
`` A ridiculously small price for such a precious creature !"
they cried unanimously , and willingly gave him what he had asked.
Mew !"
and took this answer to the King.
`` Then ,"
said the councillors , `` she shall yield to force"
Cannon were brought out , and the palace was soon in flames.
This pleased the husband right well.
`` It is true ,"
I shall be glad ,"
`` The milk is not for thee ,"
`` Certainly ,"
`` Who has taught thee to manage cows ?"
`` Wife ,"
`` What !"
And wish for death , since all round went wrong.
`` That is the moon ,"
He receives a thaler a week from us for doing it"
`` I 'll tell you what we 'll do ,"
The people here may buy themselves another"
`` I 'm a good climber ,"
said the third , `` I will bring it down"
The light of the moon decreased , but still not visibly.
`` I am going to bury my little hen"
`` May I drive with thee ?"
Then the procession went onwards , and they reached the stream.
`` How are we to get over ?"
said the little cock.
she spoke to him in a friendly way.
`` Good-day , dear Mr.
`` I understand but one ,"
replied the cat , modestly.
`` What art is that ?"
asked the fox.
`` Is that all ?"
said the fox.
Just then came a hunter with four dogs.
`` Open your sack , Mr.
Fox , open your sack ,"
`` Ah , Mr.
Fox ,"
cried the cat.

`` I was gliding over the Lueneburg Heath ,"
the Moon said.
`` The morning dawn came glimmering red.
Thou must sell thyself , thy wife , and thy children.
But your griefs shall not last long.
Fare away , fare away , over the heaving billows.
The women carried hymn books , and walked into the church.
`` I will now give you a picture from Frankfort ,"
said the Moon.
`` I especially noticed one building there.
It stood near the old Jews ' Street.
It was Rothschild 's house.
`` I looked through the open door.
She was his mother.
That was her firm belief"
But I thought of the old woman in the narrow despised street.
So said Ole the tower-keeper.
`` I will give you another picture of Sweden ,"
said the Moon.
How quietly they sleep ! I can remember them quite plainly.
And Fatty wanted them all.
To his delight , there were goodies almost without end.
He was thirsty , then.
And Fatty crept close to the edge of the hole and drank.
He did not care to stir about just then.
At last Fatty Coon rose to his feet.
He felt very queer.
There was a strange , tight feeling about his stomach.
And his sides were no longer thin.
He wondered what he had been eating.
`` I know you already ,"
Yet two others ventured in , but they fared no better.
All praised his courage , though many feared for his life.
George , who slew the dragon.
in a harsh voice.
`` Strike home ! strike home !"
screamed the crowd outside to the valiant hero.
`` Any one who was standing where I am standing ,"
answered he , `` would not cry , strike home !"
`` The monster ,"
`` My opinion ,"
Thus no one will have to endanger his life.
All agreed with him.
AND then person_0 asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.
person_0 ran on , and on.
THE path ended under a big rock.
LUCIE , knocked -- once -- twice , and interrupted the song.
A little frightened voice called out `` Who 's that ?"
said person_0.
`` Have you seen my pocket-handkins ?"
`` WHAT 'S that thing ?"
said person_0 -- `` that 's not my pocket-handkin ?"
said person_0.
said Mrs.
Tiggy - winkle"
`` Kimbo ,"
said his mother , `` mind and be a good boy"
`` Mr.
Kintaro ,"
said the faithful animals , `` we wish you good health on your travels"
Lord Raiko 's army was famous for its band called `` The Four Braves"
He was by far the strongest of them all.
Lord Raiko ordered Kintaro to the rescue.
Is not this the story of a great hero ?"
This and that He vaunted with assertion pat.
With this I shall buy a couple of goats.
Then , with the goats , I shall buy cows.
As soon as they have calved , I shall sell the calves.
With that gold I shall get a house with four wings.
She will have a son , and I shall call him Somasarman.
Then I get up , and give her such a kick with my foot"
All the rice fell over him , and made him quite white.
and every one believed it.
`` What a wonderful horn !"
`` Yes ,"
replied the hen , `` come , we will have some pleasure together"
`` I like that !"
and ran with open beak at the cock.
They cried , `` Stop ! stop !"
And now they had themselves well served , and feasted and rioted.
`` This morning everything attacks my head ,"
-- `` What 's that I hear ? Refection bell !"
` Tis time to part.
Adieu ! -- Farewell ! -- `` How 's this ?"
exclaimed the abbess , `` why `` The last at table ?"
-- `` Madam , I `` Have had my dress-maker"
So the ears were left as they now grow"
`` Let it be wanting ,"
I am in a hurry"
Shall I take him to the blacksmith ?"
`` Let it still be wanting ,"
I am in haste"
He rode forth , but before long the horse began to limp.
And there he did not arrive until quite late at night.
`` And that unlucky nail ,"
said he to himself , `` has caused all this disaster"
Hasten slowly"
and carried them off with her.
The boy said , `` What are the three questions ?"
But no one was able to do it.
The youngest are content if they are told `` Kribble-krabble , plurre-murre"
That history is very well known.
It is certainly rightly called the `` wild moor ;"
He sank and went down to the `` marsh king ,"
as they called him , who ruled below in the great moorland empire.
They also called him `` gungel king ;"
but we like the name `` marsh king"
`` I 've something very terrible to tell you ,"
he said to the stork-mamma.
`` Let that be ,"
she replied.
`` You must know it ,"
he continued.
She has come here , and she is gone !"
`` You are much too long-winded !"
exclaimed the stork-mamma , `` and the eggs might catch cold.
I ca n't bear being kept in such suspense !"
`` I have kept watch ,"
`` Yes , certainly ,"
she replied ; `` but tell me about the princess.
I 'm sick of hearing of the swan 's feathers"
continued stork-papa.
-LRB- person_0 : THE PRINCESS LEFT IN THE MARSH.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Why , that is terrible !"
said stork-mamma.
`` I ca n't bear to hear any more of it.
But now tell me what happened next"
`` The princess wept and lamented aloud.
Your heart would have burst , mother , if you had seen it"
said stork-mamma ; `` the eggs might suffer by it.
said stork-papa.
And he was as good as his word.
`` But she can not possibly be left lying there ,"
But stay , I have a thought.
I shall fly with the child to the Viking 's wife.
What rejoicing there will be yonder !"
`` So you see ,"
she said.
A good wind for one is a contrary wind for another.
`` All males here , and ready ,"
they cried ; `` and the wives and children too"
`` How light we feel !"
Ah , how charming it is , traveling to foreign lands !"
`` Mind you keep close to us during your flight ,"
said papa and mamma.
`` Do n't use your beaks too much , for that tires the chest"
And the storks flew away.
-LRB- person_0 : THE VIKING 'S FEAST.
`` Birds feather-less ,"
`` Is there anything more to be seen ?"
they asked.
`` Are we to go much farther into the country ?"
`` There 's nothing further to be seen ,"
answered stork-mamma.
I shall stay here , and you shall stay too"
And there they remained.
`` She is dead !"
But we had our revenge.
Never will she return to the land of Egypt"
And then the two wept.
-LRB- person_0 : THE KING OF EGYPT DECEIVED BY THE PRINCESSES.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Treachery and lies !"
he cried.
`` I should like to run my beak deep into their chests"
`` And perhaps break it off ,"
interposed the stork-mamma ; `` and then you would look well.
`` That is a beautiful thought !"
stork-papa said immediately.
`` I do n't quite understand it ,"
But one thing stork-papa understood.
`` But where do you intend to hide them ?"
asked stork-mamma.
`` Up in our nest in the moor ,"
answered he.
In those northern countries no one can have too many wraps"
`` No one will thank you for it ,"
quoth stork-mamma ; `` but you 're the master.
Except at breeding-time , I have nothing to say"
`` Self-achieved is well-achieved ,"
she said.
-LRB- person_0 : THE TRANSFORMED PRINCESS.
Her eyes then assumed a very melancholy expression.
`` And our good nest would be destroyed too ,"
Helga does n't know in the least what she does.
`` You are much better than your words ,"
said stork-papa.
`` I know you better than you know yourself"
said stork-mamma to herself ; `` but I wo n't tell him so"
For the first time a man was to be sacrificed here.
as she said.
`` Thy hard time will come ,"
The wrinkled frog crouched in the corner alone.
It seemed as if a strong hidden will gave her strength.
-LRB- person_0 : THE FLIGHT.
Then she trembled.
Helga was again the beautiful maiden with the wicked , demoniac spirit.
The child 's short garment reached only to her knee.
`` Let me get at thee !"
She pressed in upon him.
-LRB- person_0 : THE CHRISTIAN PRIEST 'S SPELL.
`` Thou must sit behind me , not before me ,"
he said.
And he knelt down and prayed fervently.
-LRB- person_0 : HELGA AND THE PRIEST ATTACKED BY ROBBERS.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Where hast thou stolen that beauteous maiden ?"
Then the robbers were seized with terror , and let her go.
The full moon was already rising.
At last she saw that her endeavors would not succeed.
And now she thought the grave-hill would be strong and secure.
-LRB- person_0 : HELGA IN THE TREE.
Her sleep , however , was short.
Towards midnight she awoke.
-LRB- person_0 : HELGA IS TAKEN BACK TO THE MARSH.
`` Thou daughter of the moorland ,"
I come from the land of the dead.
He took the cross from the grave and held it aloft.
Every germ came forth from the deep ground.
All that had life lifted itself up.
-LRB- person_0 : HELGA MEETS WITH HER MOTHER IN THE MARSH.
asked the mother.
`` Is it myself that I see reflected on the clear mirror ?"
exclaimed the daughter.
And they approached one another , and embraced.
`` In the swan 's plumage came I hither ,"
Since that hour I have dreamed no more.
`` And now we will speak with one another ,"
It happens more than fortunately that you came to-night.
`` And the lotos-flower which I was to bring with me ,"
Homeward ! homeward !"
`` Yes , we must go to the Viking 's castle ,"
said stork-papa ; `` mother and the youngsters are waiting for us there.
I 'll begin clapping at once , that they may know we 're coming"
In the castle every one was sunk in deep sleep.
It was a terrible hour.
`` White Christian !"
-LRB- person_0 : THE DISGUISED PRINCESSES BID FAREWELL TO THE VIKING WOMAN.
`` We will not wait for the swans ,"
