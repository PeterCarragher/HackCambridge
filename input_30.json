tan.\n", "She alighted from the carriage , went to him , shook him , and called him , but he did not awake.\n", "Next day about noon , the old woman came again and brought him food and drink , but he would not take any of it.\n", "But she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink out of the glass.\n", "He could not help himself , and was forced to lie down ,

, and there was no wakening him.\n", "At two o'clock the raven came with four black horses , and the coachman and everything else was black.\n", "She was already in the deepest grief , and said , `` I know that he is asleep and can not deliver me\"\n", "When she came to him , there he was lying fast asleep.\n", "She shook him and called him , but she could not waken him.\n", "After this she took a gold ring from her finger , and put it on his , and her name was graven on it.\n", "And when she had given him all these things , she seated herself in her carriage , and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.\n", "Then he perceived the things which were lying beside him , and read the letter wherein was written how everything had happened.\n", "So he arose and went away , intending to go to the golden castle of Stromberg , but he did not know where it was.\n", "Then it was once more evening , and he was so tired that he lay down in a thicket and fell asleep.\n", "And at the time when people light the candles , he saw one glimmering , and arose and went towards it.\n", "Then he came to a house which seemed very small , for in front of it a great giant was standing.\n", "He thought to himself , `` If I go in , and the giant sees me , it will very likely cost me my life\"\n", "At length he ventured it and went in.\n", "`` I 'd rather you would leave that alone ,\"\n", "`` If that be true ,\"\n", "said the giant , `` thou mayst be easy , I was only going to devour thee because I had nothing else\"\n", "`` This pleases me well ,\"\n", "said the giant , and ate to his heart 's content.\n", "Then the man said to him , `` Canst thou tell me where the golden castle of Stromberg is ?\"\n", "The giant said , `` I will look at my map ; all the towns , and villages , and houses are to be found on it\"\n", "He brought out the map which he had in the room and looked for the castle , but it was not to be found on it.\n", "`` It 's no matter !\"\n", "said he , `` I have some still larger maps in my cupboard upstairs , and we will look in them\"\n", "But there , too , it was in vain.\n", "When the brother came home they inquired about the golden castle of Stromberg.\n", "He replied , `` When I have eaten and have had enough , I will look in the map\"\n", "Then he went with them up to his chamber , and they searched in his map , but could not find it.\n", "`` How am I to get there ?\"\n", "asked the man.\n", "And he turned back , but the man went onwards day and night , until at length he came to the golden castle of Stromberg.\n", "It stood on a glass-mountain , and the bewitched maiden drove in her carriage round the castle , and then went inside it.\n", "Then one day he saw from his hut three robbers who were beating each other , and cried to them , `` God be with ye !\"\n", "So he again cried , `` God be with ye !\"\n", "Again they stopped , looked round about , but as they saw no one they went on beating each other.\n", "Then he cried for the third time , `` God be with ye ,\"\n", "and thought , `` I must see what these three are about ,\"\n", "and went thither and asked why they were beating each other so furiously.\n", "One of them said that he found a stick , and that when he struck a door with it , that door would spring open.\n", "And now they did not know whether they ought to have these things in common , or whether they ought to divide them.\n", "Then the man said , `` I will give you something in exchange for these three things.\n", "Money indeed have I not , but I have other things of more value ; but first I must try yours to see if you have told the truth\"\n", "So he gave them some vigorous blows and cried , `` Now , vagabonds , you have got what you deserve , are you satisfied ?\"\n", "And he rode up the glass-mountain , but when he came in front of the castle at the top , it was shut.\n", "Then he struck the door with his stick , and it sprang open immediately.\n", "He went in and ascended the stairs until he came to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden cup full of wine before her.\n", "She , however , could not see him because he had the mantle on.\n", "Then she cried , `` That is my ring , so the man who is to set me free must be here\"\n", "When they came to the door , they saw him and cried aloud in their delight.\n", "`` Very well ,\"\n", "said the father , `` I am quite content with that ,\"\n", "and gave him some money for his journey.\n", "So he traveled about and looked for work.\n", "said the huntsman , `` if thou wilt go with me\"\n", "Then the young fellow went with him , bound himself to him for some years , and learned the art of hunting.\n", "Then he set out and found himself in a very large forest , which he could not get to the end of in one day.\n", "When evening came he seated himself in a high tree in order to escape from the wild beasts.\n", "Towards midnight , it seemed to him as if a tiny little light glimmered in the distance.\n", "Then he looked down through the branches towards it , and kept well in his mind where it was.\n", "Then he got down and went to his hat , put it on again and went straight forwards.\n", "Presently one of them said , `` I must just taste if the meat will soon be fit to eat ,\"\n", "and pulled a piece off , and was about to put it in his mouth when the huntsman shot it out of his hand.\n", "`` Well , really ,\"\n", "said the giant , `` if the wind has not blown the bit out of my hand !\"\n", "and helped himself to another.\n", "But when he was just about to bite into it , the huntsman again shot it away from him.\n", "`` I have not snatched it away ,\"\n", "said the other , `` a sharpshooter must have shot it away from thee\"\n", "The giant took another piece , but could not , however , keep it in

born and bred in the rural province of Echigo.\n", "The husband laughed and said : `` Why , it is your own face that you see.\n", "What I have brought you is called a mirror , and whoever looks into its clear surface can see their own form reflected there.\n", "There the mirror is considered a very necessary requisite for a woman to possess.\n", "It is also one of the treasures that form the

things.\n", "All you have to do is to make haste and get well -- that will bring the greatest happiness to father and myself\"\n", "And now I have something to give you whereby to remember me when I am gone\"\n", "Putting her hand out , she took from the side of the pillow a square wooden box tied up with a silken cord and tassels.\n", "Undoing this very carefully , she took out of the box the mirror that her husband had given her years ago.\n", "This I give you before I die.\n", "With these words the dying woman handed the mirror to her daughter.\n", "The mind of the good mother seemed to be now at rest , and sinking back without another word her spirit passed quietly away that day.\n", "The bereaved father and daughter were wild with grief , and they abandoned themselves to their bitter sorrow.\n", "But this frantic burst of grief passed , and then they took possession of their own hearts again , crushed though they were in resignation.\n", "In spite of this the daughter 's life seemed to her desolate.\n", "One day when her father was out , and she was fulfilling her household duties alone , her loneliness and sorrow seemed more than she could bear.\n", "She threw
