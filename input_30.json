Three words th ' apostle taught : be these your care ; FAITH , CHARITY , and PRUDENCE learn to share.
In short 'twas difficult to say , What charity was shown from day to day.
That makes no difference , the lady cried.
-- What tithe ? cried he ; it surely has a name.
Not know ! astonishingly , replied the wife.

Some ostentation ever is with grief Those who weep most the soonest gain relief.

The corpse , howe'er , too plainly told her pain , And fully seemed the myst ` ry to explain.
We 've sworn , exclaimed the slave , what 's ` yond belief , That here we 'll die of famine and of grief.

I 've found her gambols such from first to last , And judge the future by experience past.
The mistress ' loss for once was thus repaid ; The barter mutual : -- wife against the maid.
The urchin blind , who sees enough to lay His num ` rous snares , such tricks will often play.
In proof , we 'll state what happened at Marseilles : The story is so true , no doubt prevails.
To pay the girl with kindness such as this , In my opinion , was not much amiss.
At that rate what should be the mistress ' price ? Perhaps still less : she might not be so nice.
Our husband thought his purse not over strong , That saving fifty crowns would not be wrong.
To settle this , at length three dice they took ; The friend was highest placed in Fortune 's book.
THIS scene just ended , t ` other actor came , Whose prompt"
I LATELY vowed to leave the nuns alone , So oft their freaks have in my page been shown.
But let us to an end the subject bring , And after this , of other matters sing.

At length NECESSITY -LRB- the parent found Of stratagems and wiles , so much renowned , -RRB- Induced the youth.

A chapter instantly the lady held ; Long time upon the circumstance they dwelled.
THE miller laughed at what the other spoke ; Untied his hands , and ev ` ry bandage broke.
The other never asked his wishes twice , But tied him well , and left him in a trice.
At certain pleasant play I 'm clever found ; But as to whips -- I never was renowned.
This work so well the aged troop achieved , He long remembered what his skin received.

But what became of this or that , at last , I 've never heard , and care not how it past.
` Tis quite enough to save the young gallant , And more particulars we do not want.
If you 've some talents , with a pleasing face , Your purse-strings open free , and you 've the place.
The stingy , women ever will detest ; Words puppies want ; -- the lib ` ral are the best.

Besides , your friends assuredly should know What mind , what sentiments may from her flow.
But you 'll be present , said the courteous knight.
And what of that ? rejoined the wily spouse.
Agreed , rejoined the husband : -- let 's begin ; Away he flew , and brought the lady in.
WHEN our gallant the charming belle perceived ; Elysium seemed around , he half believed.
Cold is that lover who will not pursue , With ev ` ry ardor , beauty , when in view.
Said he , these youths have always in their head Some wond ` rous fancies ; follies round them spread.
Friend , from pursuit you much too soon retire : With time we oft obtain our fond desire.
The country house received him ev ` ry night ; At home he never dreamed but all was right.
IN ev ` ry age , at Naples , we are told , Intrigue and gallantry reign uncontrolled ; With beauteous objects in abundance blessed.

Jack brought the couple presently to meet.
The lady found , howe'er , not what she sought : No guilty spouse , nor Mrs.

At this our arch gallant with laughter burst.
Till stratagem was used I naught could gain , But looks and darts from eyes , for all my pain.
If , howsoe'er you will \* \* \* but say no more ; Such thoughts for ever banish , I implore.
What more remains to do ? the worst is past ; ` Tis step the first that costs , however classed.
THUS person_0 pleasantly employed his time , Contented lived , concentring joys sublime.
On board they had a man or two at most.
And each the best adventure hop 'd to boast.

I 'd rather live without or soup or bread , Than work for them , however nicely fed.
Well , said the former , if resolved to try , To their factotum instantly apply ; Come ; let 's away.
The eight encircled him with great surprise ; No longer dumb.

Ye FAIR , with charms divine , I know your fame ; No more I 'll burn my fingers in the flame.
Far better surely mortals here might do ; There 's no occasion dangers to pursue.
HER name was Alibech , if I recollect ; Too innocent , deceptions to detect.
WITH silent steps the innocent withdrew ; To mothers , sisters , -- none she bade adieu.
Heav ` n guards from ill the maids and wives who fast , Or holiness would very seldom last.
THE hermit surely would have acted right ; Such pupil to have sent away at sight.
He managed otherwise , as we shall state ; The consequences , let us now relate.
A little fruit , and bread not over fine , She had for supper : -- water too for wine.
The hermit fasted ; but the lady fed , And ate with appetite her fruit and bread.
These , however , were the two ministers.
She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him.
Then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water.
In the white lily bloom , Brave boy , is thy tomb"
When the two heard that , they were frightened to death , and ran away in great haste.
When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog.
Then the King said , `` What God does , is well done !"
Then up flew a little bird again and sang , `` To thy death art thou sped , Until God 's word be said.
In the white lily bloom , Brave boy , is thy tomb"
The fisherman , however , fished this one also out of the water , and reared him.
Then the King again journeyed forth , and the Queen had a little girl , whom also the false sisters threw into the water.
Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang , `` To thy death art thou sped Until God 's word be said.
In the white lily bloom , Bonny girl , is thy tomb"
And when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat.
Then the King grew angry , and ordered his wife to be cast into prison , and therein was she shut up for many long years.
In the meantime the children had grown up.
So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father.
The fisherman , however , entreated him to stay , but he would not let himself be hindered , and at last the fisherman consented.
`` Good day , mother ,"
said the boy.
`` Many thanks ,"
said she.
`` Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything"
`` And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father.
How wilt thou get over the water ?"
said the woman.
`` God knows"
When a year had gone by , the second boy set out to seek his brother.
He came to the water , and all fared with him just as with his brother.
Then she likewise came to the great piece of water , and she said to the old woman , `` Good day , mother"
`` Many thanks ,"
replied the old woman.
`` May God help you with your fishing ,"
said the maiden.
Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain , and with these two things go back by the same way.
There the old woman was still standing.
But the second son could not settle at home , and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting.
When he was tired he took his flute , and made music.
`` Oh , no one"
`` To whom dost thou belong , then ?"
`` I am the fisherman 's son"
`` But he has no children"
`` If thou wilt not believe , come with me"
The sisters twain so false , They wrought the children woe , There in the waters deep Where the fishermen come and go"
She had , however , grown quite ill and weak.
Then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink , and she became strong and healthy.
But the two false sisters were burnt , and the daughter married the prince"
`` But we must make a provision for winter , or else we shall suffer from hunger ,"
said the cat , `` and you , little mouse , can not venture everywhere , or you will be caught in a trap some day"
The good advice was followed , and a pot of fat was bought , but they did not know where to put it.
We will set it beneath the altar , and not touch it until we are really in need of it"
Let me go out to-day , and you look after the house by yourself"
`` Yes , yes ,"
All this , however , was untrue ; the cat had no cousin , and had not been asked to be godmother.
`` Well , here you are again ,"
said the mouse , `` no doubt you have had a merry day"
`` All went off well ,"
answered the cat.
`` What name did they give the child ?"
`` Top off !"
said the cat quite coolly.
`` Top off !"
cried the mouse , `` that is a very odd and uncommon name , is it a usual one in your family ?"
`` What does it signify ,"
said the cat , `` it is no worse than Crumb-stealer , as your god-children are called"
Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing.
She said to the mouse , `` You must do me a favor , and once more manage the house for a day alone.
I am again asked to be godmother , and , as the child has a white ring round its neck , I can not refuse"
The good mouse consented , but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church , and devoured half the pot of fat.
`` Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself ,"
said she , and was quite satisfied with her day 's work.
When she went home the mouse inquired , `` And what was this child christened ?"
`` Half-done ,"
answered the cat.
`` Half-done ! What are you saying ? I never heard the name in my life , I 'll wager anything it is not in the calendar !"
The cat 's mouth soon began to water for some more licking.
`` All good things go in threes ,"
said she , `` I am asked to stand godmother again.
`` Top-off ! Half-done !"
answered the mouse , `` they are such odd names , they make me very thoughtful"
`` You sit at home ,"
During the cat 's absence the mouse cleaned the house , and put it in order but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat.
`` When everything is eaten up one has some peace ,"
said she to herself , and well filled and fat she did not return home till night.
The mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child.
`` It will not please you more than the others ,"
said the cat.
`` He is called All-gone"
`` All-gone ,"
cried the mouse , `` that is the most suspicious name of all ! I have never seen it in print.
All-gone ; what can that mean ?"
and she shook her head , curled herself up , and lay down to sleep.
`` Yes ,"
answered the cat , `` you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window"
They set out on their way , but when they arrived , the pot of fat certainly was still in its place , but it was empty.
`` Alas !"
First top off , then half done , then --"
`` Will you hold your tongue ,"
cried the cat , `` one word more and I will eat you too"
`` All gone"
was already on the poor mouse 's lips ; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her , seized her , and swallowed her down.
Verily , that is the way of the world"
As he went , a poor man met him , who asked him where he was going.
`` Oh ,"
Go home and tell the nurse that she is to come to the church with the child"
When they all got to the church together , the beggar was already there , and he gave the child the name of Ferdinand the Faithful.
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the father , `` thou hadst a key if there is a castle standing on the heath , just go to it and open it"
Then the boy went thither , but no castle was to be seen , or heard of.
After seven years more , when he was fourteen years old , he again went thither , and there stood the castle.
When he had opened it , there was nothing within but a horse , a white one.
Then the boy was so full of joy because he had a horse , that he mounted on it and galloped back to his father.
`` Now I have a white horse , and I will travel ,"
said he.
So he set out , and as he was on his way , a pen was lying on the road.
As he was thus riding away , a voice called after him , `` Ferdinand the Faithful , take it with thee"
He looked around , but saw no one , then he went back again and picked it up.
and he took hold of it by the tail , and threw it into the lake.
Then he rode away , and there came to him a man who asked him where he was going.
`` Oh , to the next place"
Then what his name was ? `` Ferdinand the Faithful"
`` So ! then we have got almost the same name , I am called Ferdinand the Unfaithful"
And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place.
There was , however , in the inn an honest girl , who had a bright face and behaved very prettily.
She fell in love with Ferdinand the Faithful because he was a handsome man , and she asked him whither he was going.
`` Oh , I am just traveling round about ,"
said he.
He answered he could not very well go to any one like that and offer himself.
Then said the maiden , `` Oh , but I will soon do that for you"
And so she went straight to the King , and told him that she knew of an excellent servant for him.
He was well pleased with that , and had Ferdinand the Faithful brought to him , and wanted to make him his servant.
When Ferdinand the Unfaithful learned that , he said to the girl , `` What ! Dost thou help him and not me ?"
`` Oh ,"
said the girl , `` I will help thee too"
She thought , `` I must keep friends with that man , for he is not to be trusted"
She went to the King , and offered him as a servant , and the King was willing.
Now when the King met his lords in the morning , he always lamented and said , `` Oh , if I had but my love with me"
Ferdinand the Unfaithful was , however , always hostile to Ferdinand the Faithful.
Ferdinand the Faithful went into the stable to his white horse , and complained and lamented , `` Oh , what an unhappy man I am !"
Then someone behind him cried , `` Ferdinand the Faithful , why weepest thou ?"
Then some one cried once more , `` Ferdinand the Faithful , why weepest thou ?"
Then for the first time he was aware that it was his little white horse who was putting that question.
`` Dost thou speak , my little white horse ; canst thou do that ?"
If he will give thee a ship full of meat , and a ship full of bread , it will succeed.
Then the King made all the butchers in the land kill , and all the bakers bake , that the ships might be filled.
then they will do nothing to thee , and when thou comest to the castle , the giants will help thee.
Then go up to the castle , and take a couple of giants with thee.
Then the little white horse said he was just to load the ships full again.
So it happened again as it had happened before , and the giants and the birds were satisfied , and made gentle by the meat.
And Ferdinand the Faithful went in , and fetched them.
So he took the writings to the castle , where the wedding was celebrated.
The Queen , however , did not love the King because he had no nose , but she would have much liked to love Ferdinand the Faithful.
Then the King said to her , `` My child , and where hast thou learned that ?"
`` Yes ,"
she said , `` I understand the art ; shall I just try it on thee also ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said he.
Then the King was buried , but she married Ferdinand the Faithful.
And when he had done that , the white horse stood up on its hind legs , and was changed into a King 's son"
He thought , `` If any good suitor comes and asks for her , I will give her to him"
Whenever she saw , or thought of him , she felt a secret horror.
Once he said to her , `` Thou art my betrothed , and yet thou hast never once paid me a visit"
The maiden replied , `` I know not where thy house is"
Then said the bridegroom , `` My house is out there in the dark forest"
She tried to excuse herself and said she could not find the way there.
She went inside it , but no one was within , and the most absolute stillness reigned.
Suddenly a voice cried , `` Turn back , turn back , young maiden dear , ` Tis a murderer 's house you enter here"
The maiden looked up , and saw that the voice came from a bird , which was hanging in a cage on the wall.
Again it cried , `` Turn back , turn back , young maiden dear , ` Tis a murderer 's house you enter here"
At last she came to the the cellar , and there sat an extremely aged woman , whose head shook constantly.
`` Can you not tell me ,"
said the maiden , `` if my betrothed lives here ?"
`` Alas , poor child ,"
replied the old woman , `` whither hast thou come ? Thou art in a murderer 's den.
Thou thinkest thou art a bride soon to be married , but thou wilt keep thy wedding with death.
If I do not have compassion on thee , and save thee , thou art lost"
Thereupon the old woman led her behind a great hogshead where she could not be seen.
`` Be as still as a mouse ,"
said she , `` do not make a sound , or move , or all will be over with thee.
At night , when the robbers are asleep , we will escape ; I have long waited for an opportunity"
Hardly was this done , than the godless crew came home.
They dragged with them another young girl.
They were drunk , and paid no heed to her screams and lamentations.
Thereupon they tore off her delicate raiment , laid her on a table , cut her beautiful body in pieces and strewed salt thereon.
The poor bride behind the cask trembled and shook , for she saw right well what fate the robbers had destined for her.
The robber took a candle and wanted to look for it , but could not find it.
Then another of them said , `` Hast thou looked behind the great hogshead ?"
Then the robbers said , `` The old woman is right ,"
But God helped her , and she got safely over.
When the day came when the wedding was to be celebrated , the bridegroom appeared , and the Miller had invited all his relations and friends.
As they sat at table , each was bidden to relate something.
The bride sat still , and said nothing.
Then said the bridegroom to the bride , `` Come , my darling , dost thou know nothing ? Relate something to us like the rest"
She replied , `` Then I will relate a dream.
And this it cried once more.
` My darling , I only dreamt this.
' My darling , I only dreamt this.
My darling , I only dreamt this.
Thereupon they pulled off her pretty clothes , and hewed her fair body in pieces on a table , and sprinkled them with salt.
My darling , I only dreamt this.
And there is the finger with the ring !"
And with these words she drew it forth , and showed it to those present.
Then he and his whole troop were executed for their infamous deeds"
The host asked whence they came , and whither they were going ? `` We are roaming about the world and practising our art"
`` Just show me for once in a way what you can do ,"
said the host.
`` If you can do that ,"
said the innkeeper , `` you have learned everything"
The innkeeper gave it to a servant who was to set it in the cupboard , and take good care of it.
The girl , however , had a lover in secret , who was a soldier.
When therefore the innkeeper , the three army-surgeons , and everyone else in the house were asleep , the soldier came and wanted something to eat.
`` Be easy ,"
said he , `` I will help thee out of thy trouble there is a thief hanging outside on the gallows , I will cut off his hand.
Which hand was it ?"
`` The right one"
Then the girl gave him a sharp knife , and he went and cut the poor sinner 's right hand off , and brought it to her.
After this he caught the cat and cut its eyes out , and now nothing but the heart was wanting.
`` Have you not been killing , and are not the dead pigs in the cellar ?"
said he.
`` Yes ,"
said the girl.
`` That 's well ,"
said the soldier , and he went down and fetched a pig 's heart.
The second took the cat 's eyes and put them in his own head.
Then they paid their bill , and traveled farther.
Will one of you lead me , so that I do not fall"
Then with difficulty they traveled on till evening , when they reached another inn.
They went into the bar together , and there at a table in the corner sat a rich man counting money.
One of them saw this , and said , `` Comrade , what art thou about ? Thou must not steal shame on thee !"
`` Eh ,"
said he , `` but how can I stop myself ? My hand twitches , and I am forced to snatch things whether I will or not"
After this , they lay down to sleep , and while they were lying there it was so dark that no one could see his own hand.
All at once the one with the cat 's eyes awoke , aroused the others , and said.
`` Brothers , just look up , do you see the white mice running about there ?"
The two sat up , but could see nothing.
Then said he , `` Things are not right with us , we have not got back again what is ours.
We must return to the innkeeper , he has deceived us"
Then the three said he must give them a great deal of money , or they would set his house on fire.
He gave them what he had , and whatever he could get together , and the three went away with it.
It was enough for the rest of their lives , but they would rather have had their own proper organs"
Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree standing near a certain lotus pond.
And a crane thought on seeing the fish.
`` I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them"
And he went and sat down at the edge of the water , thinking how he should do it.
When the fish saw him , they asked him , `` What are you sitting there for , lost in thought ?"
`` I am sitting thinking about you ,"
said he.
`` Oh , sir ! what are you thinking about us ?"
said they.
`` Why ,"
`` Yes , indeed , sir ! what _ are _ we to do ?"
said they.
answered the crane.
`` That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard of , sir , since the world began.
It 's eating us , one after the other , that you 're aiming at"
`` Not I ! So long as you trust me , I wo n't eat you.
But if you do n't believe me that there is such a pond , send one of you with me to go and see it"
And he told them all the glories of the pond.
And when they heard what he said , they exclaimed , `` All right , sir ! You may take us with you"
Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the other pond , and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there.
Then he went back and called out : `` I 've thrown that fish in ; let another one come"
Come along.
I 'll take you too !"
`` But how will you take hold of me to carry me along ?"
`` I 'll bite hold of you with my beak"
`` You 'll let me fall if you carry me like that.
I wo n't go with you !"
`` Do n't be afraid ! I 'll hold you quite tight all the way"
If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my claws , I shall be glad to go with you"
And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him , and agreed.
And the crane took him and showed him the pond , and then turned off towards the Varana-tree.
`` Uncle !"
cried the crab , `` the pond lies that way , but you are taking me this way !"
`` Oh , that 's it , is it ?"
answered the crane.
Just as I have eaten those fish , every one of them , just so I will devour you as well !"
`` Ah ! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity ,"
answered the crab ; `` but I 'm not going to let you eat _ me _.
On the contrary , is it _ you _ that I am going to destroy.
For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting you.
If we die , we die both together ; for I will cut off this head of yours , and cast it to the ground !"
And so saying , he gave the crane 's neck a grip with his claws , as with a vice.
Grant me my life !"
`` Well , well ! step down into the pond , and put me in there"
And he turned round and stepped down into the pond , and placed the crab on the mud at its edge.
He may win indeed , sharp-witted in deceit , But only as the Crane here from the Crab !"
An aged count once lived in Switzerland , who had an only son , but he was stupid , and could learn nothing.
Then said the father , `` Hark thee , my son , I can get nothing into thy head , let me try as I will.
Thou must go from hence , I will give thee into the care of a celebrated master , who shall see what he can do with thee"
The youth was sent into a strange town , and remained a whole year with the master.
At the end of this time , he came home again , and his father asked , `` Now , my son , what hast thou learned ?"
`` Father , I have learned what the dogs say when they bark"
`` Lord have mercy on us !"
cried the father ; `` is that all thou hast learned ? I will send thee into another town , to another master"
The youth was taken thither , and stayed a year with this master likewise.
When he came back the father again asked , `` My son , what hast thou learned ?"
He answered , `` Father , I have learned what the birds say"
he answered , `` Dear father , I have this year learned what the frogs croak"
The youth wandered on , and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night 's lodging.
`` Yes ,"
The whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them , and yet no one could do anything to stop this.
As he himself would have it so , they gave him some food for the wild animals , and led him down to the tower.
Then all who heard this rejoiced , and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully.
The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more ; they had disappeared , and the country was freed from the trouble.
After some time he took it into his head that he would travel to Rome.
On the way he passed by a marsh , in which a number of frogs were sitting croaking.
He listened to them , and when he became aware of what they were saying , he grew very thoughtful and sad.
They at length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token.
The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above , and asked him on the spot if he would be pope.
Once on a time there lived a King and a Queen , who were rich , and had everything they wanted , but no children.
The Queen lamented over this day and night , and said , `` I am like a field on which nothing grows"
The donkey , therefore , was brought up and grew bigger , and his ears grew up beautifully high and straight.
`` Ah , dear little master ,"
answered the musician , `` that would come very hard to you , your fingers are certainly not suited to it , and are far too big.
I am afraid the strings would not last"
No excuses were of any use.
He was so distressed about it , that he went out into the wide world and only took with him one faithful companion.
They traveled up and down , and at last they came into a kingdom where an old King reigned who had an only but wonderfully beautiful daughter.
The donkey said , `` Here we will stay ,"
knocked at the gate , and cried , `` A guest is without open , that he may enter"
`` Then let the musician come to me ,"
said the King.
When , however , a donkey came in , every one began to laugh at the lute-player.
And now the donkey was asked to sit down and eat with the servants.
He , however , was unwilling , and said , `` I am no common stable-ass , I am a noble one"
Then they said , `` If that is what thou art , seat thyself with the men of war"
`` No ,"
said he , `` I will sit by the King"
The King smiled , and said good-humouredly , `` Yes , it shall be as thou wilt , little ass , come here to me"
Then he asked , `` Little ass , how does my daughter please thee ?"
`` Well , then , thou shalt sit next her too ,"
said the King.
`` That is exactly what I wish ,"
said the donkey , and he placed himself by her side , ate and drank , and knew how to behave himself daintily and cleanly.
let his head hang sadly , and went to the King and asked for his dismissal.
Dost thou want gold ?"
`` No ,"
said the donkey , and shook his head.
`` Dost thou want jewels and rich dress ?"
`` No"
`` Dost thou wish for half my kingdom ?"
`` Indeed , no"
Then said the King , `` if I did but know what would make thee content.
Wilt thou have my pretty daughter to wife ?"
`` Ah , yes ,"
said the ass , `` I should indeed like her ,"
and all at once he became quite merry and full of happiness , for that was exactly what he was wishing for.
So a great and splendid wedding was held.
`` Now ,"
said he , `` thou seest who I am , and seest also that I am not unworthy of thee"
Then the bride was glad , and kissed him , and loved him dearly.
Soon came the old King , `` Ah ,"
cried he , `` is the little ass merry ? But surely thou art sad ?"
said he to his daughter , `` that thou hast not got a proper man for thy husband ?"
The King was surprised , but the servant who had concealed himself came and revealed everything to him.
The King said , `` That can not be true"
`` Thy advice is good ,"
As , however , he was anxious to know how the robbed man would behave himself , he stayed awake the whole night and watched.
On this he was alarmed , and , full of grief and anxiety , said , `` Now I shall have to contrive to escape"
I will now give thee half my kingdom , and after my death thou shalt have the whole of it"
`` Then I hope that what begins so well may end well , and I will stay with you ,"
said the youth.
A sheep-dog had not a good master , but , on the contrary , one who let him suffer hunger.
As he could stay no longer with him , he went quite sadly away.
On the road he met a sparrow who said , `` Brother dog , why art thou so sad ?"
The dog replied , `` I am hungry , and have nothing to eat"
Then said the sparrow , `` Dear brother , come into the town with me , and I will satisfy thy hunger"
Then the dog seized it , ran into a corner , and devoured it.
The sparrow said , `` Now come with me to another shop , and then I will get thee one more piece that thou mayst be satisfied"
When the dog had devoured the second piece as well , the sparrow asked , `` Brother dog , hast thou now had enough ?"
`` Yes , I have had meat enough ,"
he answered , `` but I have had no bread yet"
Said the sparrow , `` Thou shalt have that also , come with me"
When that was consumed , the sparrow said , `` Brother dog , hast thou now had enough ?"
`` Yes ,"
he replied , `` now we will walk awhile outside the town"
Then they both went out on to the highway.
`` Well , do sleep ,"
answered the sparrow , `` and in the meantime I will seat myself on a branch"
So the dog lay down on the road , and fell fast asleep.
Whilst he lay sleeping there , a waggoner came driving by , who had a cart with three horses , laden with two barrels of wine.
The waggoner , however , growled to himself , `` Thou wilt not make me poor ,"
and cracked his whip and drove the cart over the dog , and the wheels killed him.
Then the sparrow cried , `` Thou hast run over my brother dog and killed him , it shall cost thee thy cart and horses"
`` Cart and horses indeed !"
said the waggoner.
`` What harm canst thou do me ?"
and drove onwards.
`` Unfortunate fellow that I am ,"
cried he.
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
said the sparrow , and flew on to the head of one of the horses and pecked his eyes out.
`` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am ,"
cried he.
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
When the driver became aware of it , he again cried , `` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am ,"
but the sparrow replied , `` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
and seated himself on the head of the second horse , and pecked his eyes out.
`` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am"
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
said the sparrow , and lighted on the third horse 's head , and pecked out his eyes.
The driver , in his rage , struck at the sparrow without looking round , and did not hit him but killed his third horse likewise.
`` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am ,"
cried he.
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
answered the sparrow.
`` Now will I make thee unfortunate in thy home ,"
and flew away.
The driver had to leave the waggon standing , and full of anger and vexation went home.
`` Ah ,"
said he to his wife , `` what misfortunes I have had ! My wine has run out , and the horses are all three dead !"
`` Alas , husband ,"
Then the driver cried , `` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am ?"
`` Not unfortunate enough yet !"
answered the sparrow ; `` waggoner , it shall cost thee thy life as well ,"
and flew out.
But the sparrow sat outside in front of the window , and cried , `` Waggoner , it shall cost thee thy life"
Then the waggoner snatched the axe and threw it at the sparrow , but it only broke the window , and did not hit the bird.
The sparrow now hopped in , placed itself on the stove and cried , `` Waggoner , it shall cost thee thy life"
At length , however , he caught it with his hand.
Then his wife said , `` Shall I kill it ?"
`` No ,"
cried he , `` that would be too merciful.
It shall die much more cruelly ,"
and he took it and swallowed it whole.
The driver gave the axe to his wife , and said , `` Wife , kill the bird in my mouth for me"
The woman struck , but missed her blow , and hit the waggoner right on his head , so that he fell dead.
But the sparrow flew up and away"
There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie.
And when she had grown up her father said , `` We will get her married"
`` Yes ,"
said the mother ; `` if only any one would come who would have her"
At length a man came from a distance and wooed her , who was called Hans ; but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really wise.
`` Oh ,"
said the father , `` she 's sharp enough ;"
and the mother said , `` Oh , she can see the wind coming up the street , and hear the flies coughing"
`` Well ,"
said Hans , `` if she is not really wise , I wo n't have her"
When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten , the mother said , `` Elsie , go into the cellar and fetch some beer"
Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body , over the misfortune which lay before her.
Those upstairs waited for the drink , but Clever Elsie still did not come.
Then the woman said to the servant , `` Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is"
The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel , screaming loudly.
`` Elsie , why weepest thou ?"
asked the maid.
`` Ah ,"
Then said the maid , `` What a clever Elsie we have !"
and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.
The boy went down , and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together.
Then he asked , `` Why are ye weeping ?"
`` Ah ,"
Then said the boy , `` What a clever Elsie we have !"
and sat down by her , and likewise began to howl loudly.
Then said the mother likewise , `` What a clever Elsie we have !"
and sat down and wept with them.
and sat down , and likewise wept with them.
When he got down , five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously , each out-doing the other.
`` What misfortune has happened then ?"
he asked.
`` Ah , dear Hans ,"
`` Come ,"
said Hans , `` more understanding than that is not needed for my household , as thou art such a clever Elsie , I will have thee ,"
and he seized her hand , took her upstairs with him , and married her.
`` Yes , dear Hans , I will do that"
After Hans had gone away , she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her.
Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.
Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler 's net with little bells and hung it round about her , and she still went on sleeping.
Then he ran home , shut the house-door , and sat down in his chair and worked.
`` Yes ,"
answered Hans , `` she is within"
Hereupon she was terrified , and said , `` Ah , heavens ! Then it is not I ,"
and went to another door ; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it , and she could get in nowhere.
Then she ran out of the village , and no one has seen her since"
There was once a King 's son who was betrothed to a maiden whom he loved very much.
Then he said to his beloved , `` I must now go and leave thee , I give thee a ring as a remembrance of me.
When I am King , I will return and fetch thee"
So he rode away , and when he reached his father , the latter was dangerously ill , and near his death.
He said to him , `` Dear son , I wished to see thee once again before my end , promise me to marry as I wish ,"
and he named a certain King 's daughter who was to be his wife.
and thereupon the King shut his eyes , and died.
His first betrothed heard of this , and fretted so much about his faithlessness that she nearly died.
Then her father said to her , `` Dearest child , why art thou so sad ? Thou shalt have whatsoever thou wilt"
She thought for a moment and said , `` Dear father , I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face , figure , and size"
The father said , `` If it be possible , thy desire shall be fulfilled ,"
Then she inquired if he required any huntsmen , and if he would take the whole of them into his service.
The King looked at her and did not know her , but as they were such handsome fellows , he said , `` Yes ,"
and that he would willingly take them , and now they were the King 's twelve huntsmen.
The King , however , had a lion which was a wondrous animal , for he knew all concealed and secret things.
It came to pass that one evening he said to the King , `` Thou thinkest thou hast twelve huntsmen ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the King , `` they are twelve huntsmen"
The lion continued , `` Thou art mistaken , they are twelve girls"
The King said , `` That can not be true ! How wilt thou prove that to me ?"
`` Oh , just let some peas be strewn in thy ante-chamber ,"
answered the lion , `` and then thou wilt soon see it.
The King was well pleased with the counsel , and caused the peas to be strewn.
Then the King 's daughter thanked him , and said to her maidens , `` Put on some strength , and step firmly on the peas"
Then they went away again , and the King said to the lion , `` Thou hast lied to me , they walk just like men"
The lion said , `` They have got to know that they were going to be put to the test , and have assumed some strength.
The King liked the advice , and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.
But the servant , who was well disposed to the huntsmen , went to them , and disclosed the project.
And next morning when the King had his twelve huntsmen summoned , they went through the ante-chamber , and never once looked at the spinning wheels.
Then the King again said to the lion , `` Thou hast deceived me , they are men , for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels"
The lion replied , `` They have learned that they were going to be put to the test , and have restrained themselves"
The King , however , would no longer believe the lion.
The twelve huntsmen always followed the King to the chase , and his liking for them continually increased.
Now it came to pass that once when they were out hunting , news came that the King 's betrothed was approaching.
When the true bride heard that , it hurt her so much that her heart was almost broken , and she fell fainting to the ground.
The King thought something had happened to his dear huntsman , ran up to him , wanted to help him , and drew his glove off.
Then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride , and when he looked in her face he recognized her.
Thereupon the wedding was celebrated , and the lion was again taken into favor , because , after all , he had told the truth"
There was once upon a time a King , but where he reigned and what he was called , I do not know.
He had no son , but an only daughter who had always been ill , and no doctor had been able to cure her.
Then it was foretold to the King that his daughter should eat herself well with an apple.
The lad did so , and set out.
On this the little man said , `` Well , so shall it be , and remain ,"
and went away.
On this the King grew angry , and had him driven out of the house.
When he got home he told his father how it had fared with him.
Then the father sent the next son , who was called Seame , but all went with him just as it had gone with Uele.
He also met the little iron man , who asked what he had there in the basket.
Seame said , `` Hogs ' bristles ,"
and the iron man said , `` well , so shall it be , and remain"
Seame , however , maintained that he certainly had the apples , and that they ought to let him go in.
At length they believed him , and led him to the King.
But when he uncovered the basket , he had but hogs ' bristles.
This enraged the King most terribly , so he caused Seame to be whipped out of the house.
`` Oh !"
The boy , however , did not believe him , and said , `` Indeed , father , I wish to go"
`` Just get away , thou stupid fellow , thou must wait till thou art wiser ,"
said the father to that , and turned his back.
Hans , however , pulled at the back of his smock-frock and said , `` Indeed , father , I wish to go"
`` Well , then , so far as I am concerned thou mayst go , but thou wilt soon come home again !"
replied the old man in a spiteful voice.
The boy , however , was tremendously delighted and jumped for joy.
`` Well , act like a fool ! thou growest more stupid every day !"
said the father again.
Hans gave him the answer that he was carrying apples with which the King 's daughter was to eat herself well.
`` Then ,"
said the little man , `` so shall they be , and remain"
Hans , however , resolutely maintained that he most certainly had no frogs ' legs , but some of the most beautiful apples in the whole kingdom.
Hans agreed to the conditions , and went home , and related how it had fared with him.
Then the father sent Uele into the forest to make a boat of that kind.
He worked diligently , and whistled all the time.
The iron man said , `` So it shall be , and remain"
By evening Uele thought he had now made the boat , but when he wanted to get into it , he had nothing but wooden bowls.
The next day Seame went into the forest , but everything went with him just as it had done with Uele.
On the third day Stupid Hans went.
He worked away most industriously , so that the whole forest resounded with the heavy strokes , and all the while he sang and whistled right merrily.
replied Hans , `` and when I have finished it , I am to have the King 's daughter for my wife"
`` Well ,"
said the little man , `` such an one shall it be , and remain"
In the evening , when the sun had turned into gold , Hans finished his boat , and all that was wanted for it.
He got into it and rowed to the palace.
The boat went as swiftly as the wind.
The maid , however , would not believe in his refusal , and at last she began to get angry with him.
Then Hans said that if the King 's daughter came herself , he would give her a hare.
The maid told this in the palace , and the daughter did go herself.
`` Good ,"
When the evening came the hare-herd whistled once more , and looked to see if all were there , and then drove them to the palace.
Hans set out at once , and walked straight forwards.
In the evening he came to a castle , and there he asked for a night 's lodging , for at that time there were no inns.
The lord of the castle promised him that with much pleasure , and asked where he was going ? Hans answered , `` To the person_0"
`` Yes , indeed ,"
said Hans , `` I will do that"
Early the next morning he went onwards , and on his way arrived at another castle in which he again stayed the night.
Then he came to a lake , and instead of a ferry-boat , a tall , tall man was there who had to carry everybody across.
The man asked Hans whither he was journeying ? `` To the person_0 ,"
said Hans.
`` Then when you get to him ,"
said the man , `` just ask him why I am forced to carry everybody over the lake"
`` Yes , indeed , most certainly I 'll do that ,"
said Hans.
Then the man took him up on his shoulders , and carried him across.
At length Hans arrived at the person_0 's house , but the wife only was at home , and not the person_0 himself.
Hans was quite satisfied with this , and got under the bed.
In the evening , the person_0 came home , and as soon as he entered the room , said , `` Wife , I smell a Christian"
`` Yes ,"
said the woman , `` one was here to-day , but he went away again ;"
and on that the person_0 said no more.
In the middle of the night when the person_0 was snoring loudly , Hans reached out and plucked a feather from his tail.
The person_0 woke up instantly , and said , `` Wife , I smell a Christian , and it seems to me that somebody was pulling at my tail"
He told me all kinds of things that in one castle they had lost the key of their money-chest , and could find it nowhere"
`` Oh ! the fools !"
said the person_0 ; `` the key lies in the wood - house under a log of wood behind the door"
`` And then he said that in another castle the daughter was ill , and they knew no remedy that would cure her"
`` Oh ! the fools !"
said the person_0 ; `` under the cellar-steps a toad has made its nest of her hair , and if she got her hair back she would be well"
`` And then he also said that there was a place where there was a lake and a man beside it who was forced to carry everybody across"
`` Oh , the fool !"
said the person_0 ; `` if he only put one man down in the middle , he would never have to carry another across"
Early the next morning the person_0 got up and went out.
The person_0 's wife repeated it all once more to him that he might not forget it , and then he went home again.
The man was hugely delighted , and told Hans that out of gratitude he would take him once more across , and back again.
But Hans said no , he would save him the trouble , he was quite satisfied already , and pursued his way.
Then Hans told him that the person_0 gave every one whatsoever he wanted.
Hans , however , married the daughter , and became King"
A poor wood-cutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the edge of a lonely forest.
he added , `` I will take a bag of millet with me and strew the seeds on the path"
Then trusting to chance , she went on and on , until the sun sank and night began to fall.
The trees rustled in the darkness , the owls hooted , and she began to be afraid.
Then in the distance she perceived a light which glimmered between the trees.
`` There ought to be some people living there , who can take me in for the night ,"
thought she , and went up to the light.
It was not long before she came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up.
She knocked , and a rough voice from inside cried , `` Come in"
The girl stepped into the dark entrance , and knocked at the door of the room.
`` Just come in ,"
By the stove lay three animals , a hen , a cock , and a brindled cow.
The girl told her story to the old man , and begged for shelter for the night.
The man said , `` Pretty little hen , Pretty little cock , And pretty brindled cow , What say ye to that ?"
`` Duks ,"
answered the animals , and that must have meant , `` We are willing ,"
for the old man said , `` Here you shall have shelter and food , go to the fire , and cook us our supper"
The girl found in the kitchen abundance of everything , and cooked a good supper , but had no thought of the animals.
She carried the full dishes to the table , seated herself by the gray-haired man , ate and satisfied her hunger.
After some time , however , the gray-haired man came , took his candle , looked at the girl and shook his head.
When he saw that she had fallen into a sound sleep , he opened a trap-door , and let her down into the cellar.
Late at night the wood-cutter came home , and reproached his wife for leaving him to hunger all day.
`` It is not my fault ,"
she replied , `` the girl went out with your dinner , and must have lost herself , but she is sure to come back to-morrow"
The wood-cutter , however , arose before dawn to go into the forest , and requested that the second daughter should take him his dinner that day.
`` I will take a bag with lentils ,"
said he ; `` the seeds are larger than millet , the girl will see them better , and ca n't lose her way"
At dinner-time , therefore , the girl took out the food , but the lentils had disappeared.
The birds of the forest had picked them up as they had done the day before , and had left none.
The animals again replied `` Duks ,"
and everything happened just as it had happened the day before.
When she was asleep the old man came , looked at her , shook his head , and let her down into the cellar.
The mother did not want to do it , and said , `` Am I to lose my dearest child , as well ?"
`` Have no fear ,"
They are still larger than lentils , and will show her the way"
At length when it grew dark , she saw the light and came to the house in the forest.
`` Duks ,"
said they.
So she went and brought some barley and stewed it for the cock and hen , and a whole armful of sweet-smelling hay for the cow.
`` I hope you will like it , dear animals ,"
said she , `` and you shall have a refreshing draught in case you are thirsty"
When the animals were fed , the girl seated herself at the table by the old man , and ate what he had left.
Then said the girl , `` Ought we not to go to bed ?"
`` Pretty little hen , Pretty little cock , And pretty brindled cow , What say ye to that ?"
The animals answered `` Duks ,"
`` Thou hast eaten with us , Thou hast drunk with us , Thou hast had kind thought for all of us , We wish thee good-night"
The girl lay down on the other , said her prayers , and fell asleep.
She slept quietly till midnight , and then there was such a noise in the house that she awoke.
There was a sound of cracking and splitting in every corner , and the doors sprang open , and beat against the walls.
`` But where are my two sisters ?"
inquired the maiden.
THERE was once upon a time an old Queen whose husband had been dead for many years , and she had a beautiful daughter.
When the princess grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance.
`` If you are thirsty ,"
said the waiting-maid , `` get off your horse yourself , and lie down and drink out of the water , I do n't choose to be your servant"
Then she said , `` Ah , Heaven !"
and the three drops of blood answered , `` If thy mother knew , her heart would break"
But the person_0 's daughter was humble , said nothing , and mounted her horse again.
for she had long ago forgotten the girl 's ill words.
But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily , `` If you wish to drink , drink as you can , I do n't choose to be your maid"
Then in her great thirst the person_0 's daughter alighted , bent over the flowing stream , wept and said , `` Ah , Heaven !"
and the drops of blood again replied , `` If thy mother knew this , her heart would break"
and the princess had to be content with that.
But Falada saw all this , and observed it well.
She was conducted upstairs , but the real princess was left standing below.
The boy was called Conrad , and the true bride had to help him to tend the geese.
Soon afterwards the false bride said to the young person_0 , `` Dearest husband , I beg you to do me a favor"
He answered , `` I will do so most willingly"
`` Then send for the knacker , and have the head of the horse on which I rode here cut off , for it vexed me on the way"
In reality , she was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the person_0 's daughter.
The knacker 's man promised to do that , and cut off the head , and nailed it fast beneath the dark gateway.
Then they went still further out of the town , and drove their geese into the country.
And there came such a violent wind that it blew Conrad 's hat far away across country , and he was forced to run after it.
When he came back she had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again , and he could not get any of it.
Then Conrad was angry , and would not speak to her , and thus they watched the geese until the evening , and then they went home.
Next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway , the maiden said , `` Alas , Falada , hanging there !"
Falada answered , `` Alas , young Queen , how ill you fare ! If this your tender mother knew , Her heart would surely break in two"
`` Why not ?"
inquired the aged person_0.
`` Oh , because she vexes me the whole day long"
Then the aged person_0 commanded him to relate what it was that she did to him.
And the head replies , `` Alas , young Queen how ill you fare ! If this your tender mother knew , Her heart would surely break in two"
And Conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture , and how when there he had to chase his hat.
He urged her and left her no peace , but he could draw nothing from her.
Then said he , `` If thou wilt not tell me anything , tell thy sorrows to the iron-stove there ,"
and he went away.
If my mother did but know that , her heart would break"
The aged person_0 , however , was standing outside by the pipe of the stove , and was listening to what she said , and heard it.
Then he came back again , and bade her come out of the stove.
`` It is thou ,"
said the aged person_0 , `` and thou hast pronounced thine own sentence , and thus shall it be done unto thee"
And when the sentence had been carried out , the young person_0 married his true bride , and both of them reigned over their kingdom in peace and happiness"
However , as person_0-eyes saw just as other human beings did , her sisters and her mother could not endure her.
They said to her , `` Thou , with thy two eyes , art no better than the common people ; thou dost not belong to us !"
So she sat down on a ridge and began to weep , and so bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes.
And once when she looked up in her grief , a woman was standing beside her , who said , `` Why art thou weeping , little person_0-eyes ?"
and then it will vanish again from thy sight"
Hereupon the wise woman departed.
But person_0-eyes thought , `` I must instantly make a trial , and see if what she said is true , for I am far too hungry ,"
and she said , `` Bleat , my little goat , bleat , Cover the table with something to eat ,"
Then person_0-eyes said the shortest prayer she knew , `` Lord God , be with us always , Amen ,"
and helped herself to some food , and enjoyed it.
and immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again.
`` That is a delightful way of keeping house !"
thought person_0-eyes , and was quite glad and happy.
Next day she again went out with her goat , and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to her , lying untouched.
and in an instant all was gone.
Come , let us go home again"
but then , instead of singing , `` Three eyes , are you sleeping ?"
as she ought to have done , she thoughtlessly sang , `` person_0 eyes , are you sleeping ?"
and sang all the time , `` Three eyes , are you waking ? person_0 eyes , are you sleeping ?"
and Three-eyes had seen everything.
When she is out , she says to the goat , `` Bleat , my little goat , bleat , Cover the table with something to eat ,"
and all disappears.
I watched everything closely.
She put two of my eyes to sleep by using a certain form of words , but luckily the one in my forehead kept awake"
Then the envious mother cried , `` Dost thou want to fare better than we do ? The desire shall pass away ,"
and she fetched a butcher 's knife , and thrust it into the heart of the goat , which fell down dead.
Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side , and said , `` person_0-eyes , why art thou weeping ?"
`` Have I not reason to weep ?"
she answered.
Then they laughed and said , `` If that 's all you want , you can have it"
So person_0-eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the evening , in front of the house-door , as the wise woman had counselled her to do.
Then the mother said to One-eye , `` Climb up , my child , and gather some of the fruit of the tree for us"
Then said the mother , `` Three-eyes , do you climb up ; you with your three eyes can look about you better than One-eye"
One-eye slipped down , and Three-eyes climbed up.
Three-eyes was not more skilful , and might search as she liked , but the golden apples always escaped her.
Then said person_0-eyes , `` I will just go up , perhaps I may succeed better"
The sisters cried , `` You indeed , with your two eyes , what can you do ?"
It so befell that once when they were all standing together by the tree , a young knight came up.
`` Quick , person_0-eyes ,"
cried the two sisters , `` creep under this , and do n't disgrace us !"
Then One-eye and Three-eyes replied that the tree belonged to them , and that they would give him a branch.
They both took great trouble , but they were not able to do it , for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time.
They again asserted that the tree was their property.
When the knight saw the apples he was astonished , and asked where they came from.
The knight , however , desired to see her , and cried , `` person_0-eyes , come forth"
`` Yes ,"
replied person_0-eyes , `` that I certainly shall be able to do , for the tree belongs to me"
And she climbed up , and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit , and gave it to the knight.
Then said the knight , `` person_0-eyes , what shall I give thee for it ?"
`` Alas !"
When person_0-eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight , her two sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest.
`` The wonderful tree , however , still remains with us ,"
Who knows what good things may be in store for us ?"
But next morning , the tree had vanished , and all their hopes were at an end.
person_0-eyes lived a long time in happiness.
Once two poor women came to her in her castle , and begged for alms.
The huckster could accomplish that ; and consequently the goblin stuck to the huckster 's shop , and that was very interesting.
One evening the student came through the back door to buy candles and cheese for himself.
He had no one to send , and that 's why he came himself.
He procured what he wanted and paid for it , and the huckster and his wife both nodded a `` good evening"
`` Yonder lies some more of the same sort ,"
said the huckster : `` I gave an old woman a little coffee for the books ; give me two groschen , and you shall have the remainder"
`` Yes ,"
said the student , `` give me the book instead of the cheese : I can eat my bread and butter without cheese.
It would be a sin to tear the book up entirely.
You are a capital man , a practical man , but you understand no more about poetry than does that cask yonder"
And the goblin laid the tongue upon the cask in which the old newspapers were lying.
`` Is it true ,"
he asked , `` that you do n't know what poetry means ?"
`` Of course I know it ,"
replied the cask : `` poetry is something that always stands at the foot of a column in the newspapers , and is sometimes cut out.
I dare swear I have more of it in me than the student , and I 'm only a poor tub compared to the huckster"
`` Now I shall tell it to the student !"
And with these words the goblin went quite quietly up the back stairs to the garret , where the student lived.
Never had the little goblin imagined such splendor , far less had he ever seen or heard anything like it.
He stood still on tiptoe , and peeped in till the light went out in the student 's garret.
`` This is an incomparable place ,"
said the goblin : `` I never expected such a thing ! I should like to stay here with the student"
And then the little man thought it over -- and he was a sensible little man too -- but he sighed , `` The student has no porridge !"
Ha ! then he shivered , and crept down again to his warm corner , where it was homely and comfortable.
But in the middle of the night the goblin was awaked by a terrible tumult and beating against the window shutters.
Was it in the house itself , or at a neighbour 's ? Where was it ? Terror seized on all.
But when the fire was extinguished , and the goblin could think calmly again , why , then.
`` I must divide myself between the two ,"
he said ; `` I ca n't quite give up the huckster , because of the porridge !"
Now , that was spoken quite like a human creature.
We all of us visit the huckster for the sake of the porridge"
by Brothers Grimm A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through all the land.
Nothing was hidden from him , and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air.
When he had carefully locked the door , he lifted up the cover , and saw a white snake lying on the dish.
No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window.
Eating the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.
In vain he declared his innocence ; he was dismissed with no better answer.
In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble.
The servant stood by and listened.
`` Yes ,"
So he cut off her head , and as she was being dressed for the spit , the Queen 's ring was found inside her.
They quivered with delight , put out their heads , and cried to him , `` We will remember you and repay you for saving us !"
He rode on , and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet.
So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to him , `` We will remember you -- one good turn deserves another !"
The path led him into a wood , and here he saw two old ravens standing by their nest , and throwing out their young ones.
`` Out with you , you idle , good-for-nothing creatures !"
cried they ; `` we can not find food for you any longer ; you are big enough , and can provide for yourselves"
So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword , and gave it to them for food.
Then they came hopping up to it , satisfied their hunger , and cried , `` We will remember you -- one good turn deserves another !"
And now he had to use his own legs , and when he had walked a long way , he came to a large city.
All the people grieved for the handsome youth ; then they went away , leaving him alone by the sea.
Full of joy he took it to the King , and expected that he would grant him the promised reward.
But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth , she scorned him , and required him first to perform another task.
After he had wandered through three kingdoms , he came one evening to a wood , and lay down under a tree to sleep.
But he heard a rustling in the branches , and a golden apple fell into his hand.
There was once a poor woodcutter who toiled from early morning till late night.
Then the boy went to a High School and learned diligently so that his masters praised him , and he remained there a long time.
`` Ah ,"
`` Dear father ,"
`` Nay , my son ,"
`` Just go to the neighbor ,"
answered the son , `` he will lend you his axe until I have earned one for myself"
The father then borrowed an axe of the neighbor , and next morning at break of day they went out into the forest together.
The son helped his father and was quite merry and brisk about it.
`` Oh , you fool ,"
He stood still and looked at it , and thought , `` Many a bird must have built its nest in that"
Then all at once it seemed to him that he heard a voice.
He listened and became aware that someone was crying in a very smothered voice , `` Let me out , let me out !"
He looked around , but could discover nothing ; nevertheless , he fancied that the voice came out of the ground.
Then he cried , `` Where art thou ?"
The voice answered , `` I am down here amongst the roots of the oak-tree.
Let me out ! Let me out !"
He lifted it up and held it against the light , and then saw a creature shaped like a frog , springing up and down in it.
`` Let me out ! Let me out !"
it cried anew , and the scholar thinking no evil , drew the cork out of the bottle.
`` Knowest thou ,"
he cried in an awful voice , `` what thy wages are for having let me out ?"
`` No ,"
replied the scholar fearlessly , `` how should I know that ?"
`` Then I will tell thee ,"
cried the spirit ; `` I must strangle thee for it"
`` Thou shouldst have told me that sooner ,"
`` More persons here , more persons there ,"
said the spirit.
`` Thou shalt have the wages thou hast earned.
Dost thou think that I was shut up there for such a long time as a favor.
No , it was a punishment for me.
I am the mighty Mercurius.
Whoso releases me , him must I strangle"
`` Softly ,"
answered the scholar , `` not so fast.
I must first know that thou really wert shut up in that little bottle , and that thou art the right spirit.
If , indeed , thou canst get in again , I will believe and then thou mayst do as thou wilt with me"
The spirit said haughtily , `` that is a very trifling feat ,"
`` No ,"
`` If thou wilt set me free ,"
said the spirit , `` I will give thee so much that thou wilt have plenty all the days of thy life"
`` No ,"
answered the boy , `` thou wouldst cheat me as thou didst the first time"
`` Thou art playing away with thy own good luck ,"
said the spirit ; `` I will do thee no harm but will reward thee richly"
The scholar thought , `` I will venture it , perhaps he will keep his word , and anyhow he shall not get the better of me"
`` Now thou shalt have thy reward ,"
`` I must just try that ,"
said the scholar , and went to a tree , tore off the bark with his axe , and rubbed it with one end of the plaster.
It immediately closed together and was healed.
`` Now , it is all right ,"
he said to the spirit , `` and we can part"
The spirit thanked him for his release , and the boy thanked the spirit for his present , and went back to his father.
`` Where hast thou been racing about ?"
said the father ; `` why hast thou forgotten thy work ? I said at once that thou wouldst never get on with anything"
`` Be easy , father , I will make it up"
`` Make it up indeed ,"
said the father angrily , `` there 's no art in that"
`` Take care , father , I will soon hew that tree there , so that it will split"
`` Do n't get angry ,"
said the son , `` I will soon pay for the axe"
`` Oh , thou blockhead ,"
cried the father , `` wherewith wilt thou pay for it ? Thou hast nothing but what I give thee.
These are students ' tricks that are sticking in thy head , but thou hast no idea of wood-cutting"
After a while the scholar said , `` Father , I can really work no more , we had better take a holiday"
`` Eh , what !"
`` Father , I am here in this wood for the first time , I do n't know my way alone.
Do go with me"
As his anger had now abated , the father at last let himself be persuaded and went home with him.
The son said , `` Give me what thou hast , I will lend you the rest"
The goldsmith gave him three hundred thalers , and remained a hundred in his debt.
The son thereupon went home and said , `` Father , I have got the money , go and ask the neighbor what he wants for the axe"
`` I know that already ,"
answered the old man , `` one thaler , six groschen"
`` Then give him him two thalers , twelve groschen , that is double and enough ; see , I have money in plenty ,"
and he gave the father a hundred thalers , and said , `` You shall never know want , live as comfortably as you like"
`` Good heavens !"
said the father , `` how hast thou come by these riches ?"
The scholar then told how all had come to pass , and how he , trusting in his luck , had made such a good hit.
There he passed many years , and no one could deliver him.
Then a King 's daughter came into the forest , who had lost herself , and could not find her father 's kingdom again.
After she had wandered about for nine days , she at length came to the iron stove.
Then a voice came forth from it , and asked her , `` Whence comest thou , and whither goest , thou ?"
She answered , `` I have lost my father 's kingdom , and can not get home again"
I am the son of a far greater King than thy father , and I will marry thee"
Then was she afraid , and thought , `` Good heavens ! What can I do with an iron stove ?"
But as she much wished to get home to her father , she promised to do as he desired.
But he said , `` Thou shalt return here , and bring a knife with thee , and scrape a hole in the iron"
Then the old King was so terrified that he all but fainted , for he had but this one daughter.
They therefore resolved they would send , in her place , the miller 's daughter , who was very beautiful.
They took her there , gave her a knife , and said she was to scrape at the iron stove.
So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours , but could not bring off the least morsel of it.
When day dawned , a voice in the stove said , `` It seems to me it is day outside"
Then she answered , `` It seems so to me too ; I fancy I hear the noise of my father 's mill"
`` So thou art a miller 's daughter ! Then go thy way at once , and let the King 's daughter come here"
So she was taken thither , and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours.
She , however , made nothing of it.
When day broke , a voice inside the stove cried , `` It seems to me it is day outside !"
Then answered she , `` So it seems to me also ; I fancy I hear my father 's horn blowing"
When the King 's daughter heard that she began to weep , but now there was nothing for it but to keep her promise.
So she took leave of her father , put a knife in her pocket , and went forth to the iron stove in the forest.
Now , therefore , she went on scraping , and made the hole so large that he was able to get out.
Then said he , `` Thou art mine , and I am thine ; thou art my bride , and hast released me"
When midnight drew near she saw in the distance a small light , and thought , `` Ah , there I should be saved !"
She got down from the tree , and went towards the light , but on the way she prayed.
She thought , `` Ah , whither have I come ,"
Then she took courage , and knocked at the door.
and a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her.
When she entered , they all bade her welcome , and she was forced to sit down.
They asked , `` Where hast thou come from , and whither art thou going ?"
Then the little one went and brought the box.
If she did all this she would get her lover back again.
After this she came to the three piercing swords , and then she seated herself on her plough-wheel , and rolled over them.
At last she arrived in front of a great lake , and when she had crossed it , she came to a large and beautiful castle.
She went and asked for a place ; she was a poor girl , she said , and would like to be hired.
She knew , however , that the King 's son whom she had released from the iron stove in the great forest was in the castle.
Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages.
The bride gave her permission because the dress was so pretty , and she had never had one like it.
When it was evening she said to her bridegroom , `` That silly girl will sleep in thy room"
`` If thou art willing so am I ,"
said he.
She , however , gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught.
So the bridegroom and the scullery-maid went to sleep in the room , and he slept so soundly that she could not waken him.
The servants sat by the chamber-door , and heard how she thus wept the whole night through , and in the morning they told it to their lord.
But the girl would not take money , and begged that she might once again sleep in the bridegroom 's chamber.
The bride , however , gave him a sleeping-drink , and he slept so soundly that he could hear nothing.
The servants sat by the chamber-door and heard her weeping the whole night through , and in the morning informed their lord of it.
The King 's son was , however , on his guard , and threw the sleeping-draught away.
the King 's son leapt up and said , `` Thou art the true one , thou art mine , and I am thine"
A mouse did run , This story is done"
A rich farmer was one day standing in his yard inspecting his fields and gardens.
The corn was growing up vigorously and the fruit-trees were heavily laden with fruit.
The grain of the year before still lay in such immense heaps on the floors that the rafters could hardly bear it.
Then he went into the stable , where were well-fed oxen , fat cows , and horses bright as looking-glass.
At length he went back into his sitting-room , and cast a glance at the iron chest in which his money lay.
Whilst he was thus standing surveying his riches , all at once there was a loud knock close by him.
The knock was not at the door of his room , but at the door of his heart.
The heart was not slow in answering , `` I have been hard and pitiless , and have never shown any kindness to my own family.
If a beggar came , I turned away my eyes from him.
I have not troubled myself about God , but have thought only of increasing my wealth.
If everything which the sky covers had been mine own , I should still not have had enough"
When he was aware of this answer he was greatly alarmed , his knees began to tremble , and he was forced to sit down.
Then there was another knock , but the knock was at the door of his room.
It was his neighbor , a poor man who had a number of children whom he could no longer satisfy with food.
`` I know ,"
thought the poor man , `` that my neighbor is rich , but he is as hard as he is rich.
I do n't believe he will help me , but my children are crying for bread , so I will venture it"
My children are starving , lend me four measures \* of corn"
The rich man looked at him long , and then the first sunbeam of mercy began to melt away a drop of the ice of greediness.
`` I will not lend thee four measures ,"
he answered , `` but I will make thee a present of eight , but thou must fulfil one condition"
`` What am I to do ?"
said the poor man.
`` When I am dead , thou shalt watch for three nights by my grave"
No one knew exactly how it came to pass , but no one grieved for him.
At nightfall he went into the churchyard , and seated himself on the grave-mound.
Everything was quiet , only the moon appeared above the grave , and frequently an owl flew past and uttered her melancholy cry.
When the sun rose , the poor man betook himself in safety to his home , and in the same manner the second night passed quietly by.
On the evening of the third day he felt a strange uneasiness , it seemed to him that something was about to happen.
When he went out he saw , by the churchyard-wall , a man whom he had never seen before.
He was no longer young , had scars on his face , and his eyes looked sharply and eagerly around.
He was entirely covered with an old cloak , and nothing was visible but his great riding-boots.
`` What are you looking for here ?"
the peasant asked.
`` Are you not afraid of the lonely churchyard ?"
`` I am looking for nothing ,"
I am nothing but a paid-off soldier , and I mean to pass the night here , because I have no other shelter"
`` If you are without fear ,"
said the peasant , `` stay with me , and help me to watch that grave there"
`` To keep watch is a soldier 's business ,"
he replied , `` whatever we fall in with here , whether it be good or bad , we will share it between us"
The peasant agreed to this , and they seated themselves on the grave together.
`` Be off , you ragamuffins !"
`` Sir with the red feather ,"
said the soldier , `` you are not my captain , I have no need to obey you , and I have not yet learned how to fear.
Go away , we shall stay sitting here"
The person_0 thought to himself , `` Money is the best thing with which to get hold of these two vagabonds"
`` I have not so much as that about me ,"
said the person_0 , `` but I will fetch it.
In the neighbouring town lives a money-changer who is a good friend of mine , and will readily advance it to me"
He cut the sole off the boot , and put it in the high grass near the grave on the edge of a hole that was half over-grown.
`` That will do ,"
said he ; `` now the chimney-sweep may come"
They both sat down and waited , and it was not long before the person_0 returned with a small bag of gold in his hand.
`` Just pour it in ,"
said the soldier , raising up the boot a little , `` but that wo n't be enough"
The Black One shook out all that was in the bag ; the gold fell through , and the boot remained empty.
`` Stupid person_0 ,"
cried the soldier , `` it wo n't do ! Did n't I say so at once ? Go back again , and bring more"
The person_0 shook his head , went , and in an hour 's time came with a much larger bag under his arm.
`` Now pour it in ,"
cried the soldier , `` but I doubt the boot wo n't be full"
The gold clinked as it fell , but the boot remained empty.
The person_0 looked in himself with his burning eyes , and convinced himself of the truth.
`` You have shamefully big calves to your legs !"
cried he , and made a wry face.
`` Did you think ,"
The Wicked One went off again.
This time he stayed away longer , and when at length he appeared he was panting under the weight of a sack which lay on his shoulders.
He emptied it into the boot , which was just as far from being filled as before.
The poor soul was saved.
Master Pfriem was a short , thin , but lively man , who never rested a moment.
He saw everything , criticised everything , knew everything best , and was always in the right.
`` Stupid thing ,"
cried he to her , while he was shaking himself , `` couldst thou not see that I was coming behind thee ?"
No apprentice stayed more than a month with him , for he had always some fault to find with the very best work.
`` Wait ,"
said he to his apprentice , `` I will soon show thee how we make skins soft ,"
and he brought a strap and gave him a couple of strokes across the back.
He called them all sluggards.
He himself did not turn much work out of his hands , for he never sat still for a quarter of an hour.
And out he would run and knock a pail full of soap and water over , so that the whole kitchen was flooded.
Someone was building a new house , so he hurried to the window to look on.
`` There , they are using that red sand-stone again that never dries !"
cried he.
I shall live to see that house tumble down on the people who are in it"
He stumbled on the carpenters.
`` What 's this ?"
cried he , `` you are not working by the line ! Do you expect the beams to be straight ? -- one wrong will put all wrong"
said he , `` who yokes young horses to a heavily-laden cart ? The poor beasts will die on the spot"
The peasant did not give him an answer , and Pfriem in a rage ran back into his workshop.
When he was setting himself to work again , the apprentice reached him a shoe.
`` Well , what 's that again ?"
`` Master ,"
When you jumped up a while since , you knocked it off the table , and I have only just picked it up.
An angel from heaven , however , would never make you believe that"
One night Master Pfriem dreamed he was dead , and on his way to heaven.
When he got there , he knocked loudly at the door.
`` I wonder ,"
said he to himself , `` that they have no knocker on the door , -- one knocks one 's knuckles sore"
The apostle Peter opened the door , and wanted to see who demanded admission so noisily.
`` Ah , it 's you , Master Pfriem ;"
`` You might have spared your warning ,"
answered Pfriem.
So he went in , and walked up and down the wide expanses of heaven.
He looked around him , to the left and to the right , but sometimes shook his head , or muttered something to himself.
Then he saw two angels who were carrying away a beam.
It was the beam which some one had had in his own eye whilst he was looking for the splinter in the eye of another.
They did not , however , carry the beam lengthways , but obliquely.
`` Did any one ever see such a piece of stupidity ?"
thought Master Pfriem ; but he said nothing , and seemed satisfied with it.
They were watering the earth with rain.
`` Hang it ,"
he exclaimed ; but happily recollected himself , and thought , `` Perhaps it is only a pastime.
He went farther and saw a cart which had stuck fast in a deep hole.
`` It 's no wonder ,"
said he to the man who stood by it ; `` who would load so unreasonably ? what have you there ?"
`` Good wishes ,"
In fact an angel did come and harnessed two horses to it.
`` That 's quite right ,"
thought Pfriem , `` but two horses wo n't get that cart out , it must at least have four to it"
Another angel came and brought two more horses ; she did not , however , harness them in front of it , but behind.
That was too much for Master Pfriem , `` Clumsy creature ,"
He was going to say more , but one of the inhabitants of heaven seized him by the throat and pushed him forth with irresistible strength.
At this moment Master Pfriem awoke.
`` Things are certainly arranged in heaven otherwise than they are on earth ,"
It is a lucky thing for me though , that I am not really dead"
Moreover , he never complained , but was contented with everything , and always merry.
When the third year also was past , the master considered , put his hand in his pocket , but pulled nothing out.
`` Yes , my good fellow ,"
answered the old miser ; `` you have served me industriously , and , therefore , you shall be cheerfully rewarded ;"
So on he went , up hill and down dale ; and sang and jumped to his heart 's content.
`` Why should I be sad ?"
answered the servant ; `` I have enough ; three years ' wages are jingling in my pocket"
`` How much is your treasure ?"
the dwarf asked him.
`` How much ? Three farthings sterling , all told"
`` Look here ,"
`` Aha ?"
`` All that shall you have ,"
`` Heart alive ! What can one desire more ?"
said the servant to himself , and went merrily onwards.
`` Good heavens ,"
`` If that is all ,"
said the servant , `` the bird shall soon be down here ;"
And taking aim he pulled the trigger , and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes.
`` Go , you rogue ,"
he said to the Jew , `` and fetch the bird out for yourself !"
`` Oh !"
said the Jew , `` leave out the rogue , my master , and I will do it at once.
I will get the bird out for myself , as you really have hit it"
Then he lay down on the ground , and began to crawl into the thicket.
When he was fast among the thorns , the good servant 's humor so tempted him that he took up his fiddle and began to play.
But the thorns tore his shabby coat from him , combed his beard , and pricked and plucked him all over the body.
`` Oh dear ,"
cried the Jew , `` what do I want with your fiddling ? Leave the fiddle alone , master ; I do not want to dance"
`` If you are so liberal ,"
and having taken the purse he went his way.
and went on abusing him as fast as he could speak.
As soon as he had refreshed himself a little in this way , and got his breath again , he ran into the town to the justice.
`` My lord judge ,"
`` Was it a soldier ,"
said the judge , `` who cut you thus with his sabre ?"
`` Nothing of the sort !"
`` Heaven defend us !"
cried the Jew , `` his lies are as thick as flies upon the wall"
But the judge also did not believe his tale , and said , `` This is a bad defense , no Jew would do that"
And because he had committed robbery on the public highway , he sentenced the good servant to be hanged.
`` Yes , if you do not ask your life ,"
said the judge.
`` I do not ask for life ,"
answered the servant , `` but as a last favor let me play once more upon my fiddle"
The Jew raised a great cry of `` Murder ! murder ! for goodness ' sake do not allow it ! Do not allow it !"
But the judge said , `` Why should I not let him have this short pleasure ? it has been granted to him , and he shall have it"
However , he could not have refused on account of the gift which had been bestowed on the servant.
Then the Jew cried , `` Oh ! woe 's me ! tie me , tie me fast !"
while the good servant took his fiddle from his neck , and made ready.
At the second scrape all raised their legs , and the hangman let go his hold of the good servant , and made himself ready to dance.
At the third scrape they all leaped up and began to dance ; the judge and the Jew being the best at jumping.
Soon all who had gathered in the market-place out of curiosity were dancing with them ; old and young , fat and lean , one with another.
At length the judge cried , quite out of breath , `` I will give you your life if you will only stop fiddling"
The good servant thereupon had compassion , took his fiddle and hung it round his neck again , and stepped down the ladder.
`` I stole it , I stole it !"
cried he ; `` but you have honestly earned it"
So the judge had the Jew taken to the gallows and hanged as a thief"
In the Garden of Paradise , beneath the Tree of Knowledge , bloomed a rose bush.
The bird perished in the flames ; but from the red egg in the nest there fluttered aloft a new one -- the one solitary Phoenix bird.
The bird flutters round us , swift as light , beauteous in color , charming in song.
He flies through the chamber of content , and brings sunshine into it , and the violets on the humble table smell doubly sweet.
But the Phoenix is not the bird of Arabia alone.
On a lotus leaf he floats down the sacred waters of the Ganges , and the eye of the Hindoo maid gleams bright when she beholds him.
and at the minstrels ' feast he fluttered through the halls of the Wartburg.
Hear what the Moon told me.
`` Some years ago , here in Copenhagen , I looked through the window of a mean little room.
The father and mother slept , but the little son was not asleep.
I saw the flowered cotton curtains of the bed move , and the child peep forth.
At first I thought he was looking at the great clock , which was gaily painted in red and green.
' But no , he was not looking at the clock , but at his mother 's spinning wheel , that stood just underneath it.
There he stood.
The thread flew from the wheel , and the wheel whirled faster and faster.
I kissed his fair hair and his blue eyes , it was such a pretty picture.
`` At that moment the mother awoke.
The curtain shook , she looked forth , and fancied she saw a gnome or some other kind of little spectre.
` In Heaven 's name ! ' she cried , and aroused her husband in a frightened way.
He opened his eyes , rubbed them with his hands , and looked at the brisk little lad.
` Why , that is person_0 , ' said he.
And my eye quitted the poor room , for I have so much to see.
At the same moment I looked at the halls of the Vatican , where the marble gods are enthroned.
I shone upon the group of the Laocoon ; the stone seemed to sigh.
I pressed a silent kiss on the lips of the Muses , and they seemed to stir and move.
But my rays lingered longest about the Nile group with the colossal god.
`` Years have passed since all this happened ,"
the Moon went on to say.
`` Yesterday I looked upon a bay on the eastern coast of Denmark.
He had blue eyes and long white hair.
I knew him , and thought of the Vatican , and of the group of the Nile , and the old marble gods.
I thought of the simple little room where little person_0 sat in his night-shirt by the spinning wheel.
The wheel of time has turned , and new gods have come forth from the stone.
From the boats there arose a shout : ` Hurrah , hurrah for person_0 Thorwaldsen ! '"
What will the next thing be ? It is wonderful !"
`` Yes , certainly ,"
said the person_0.
`` It 's extraordinary -- that 's what I always say ,"
he exclaimed to the pen and to the other articles on the table that were near enough to hear.
`` It is wonderful what a number of things can come out of me.
It 's quite incredible.
And I really do n't myself know what will be the next thing , when that man begins to dip into me.
I myself do n't understand how it is , for I am not acquainted with nature , but it certainly is in me.
`` There you are right ,"
said the Pen ; `` you do n't think at all ; for if you did , you would comprehend that you only furnish the fluid.
You give the fluid , that I may exhibit upon the paper what dwells in me , and what I would bring to the day.
It is the pen that writes.
No man doubts that ; and , indeed , most people have about as much insight into poetry as an old inkstand"
`` You have but little experience ,"
replied the person_0.
`` You 've hardly been in service a week , and are already half worn out.
I know the quill as well as the steel pen.
I should like to know what will be the next thing he 'll take out of me"
`` Inkpot !"
exclaimed the Pen.
Late in the evening the poet came home.
He had been to a concert , where he had heard a famous violinist , with whose admirable performances he was quite enchanted.
The poet thought he heard his own heart weeping , but weeping melodiously , like the sound of woman 's voice.
It seemed as though not only the strings sounded , but every part of the instrument.
We are only the instruments which the Almighty uses : to Him alone be the honor ! We have nothing of which we should be proud"
Yes , that is what the poet wrote down.
He wrote it in the form of a parable , which he called `` The Master and the Instruments"
`` That is what you get , madam ,"
said the Pen to the person_0 , when the two were alone again.
`` Did you not hear him read aloud what I have written down ?"
`` Yes , what I gave you to write ,"
retorted the person_0.
`` That was a cut at you , because of your conceit.
`` Ink-pipkin !"
cried the Pen.
`` Writing-stick !"
cried the person_0.
But the poet did not sleep.
Thoughts welled up from within him , like the tones from the violin , falling like pearls , rushing like the storm-wind through the forests.
He understood his own heart in these thoughts , and caught a ray from the Eternal Master.
To _ Him _ be all the honor !"
A soldier who is afraid of nothing , troubles himself about nothing.
He had an old waterproof on his back , and a pair of riding-boots of buffalo-leather which were still left to him.
One day he was walking he knew not where , straight out into the open country , and at length came to a forest.
The soldier shook hands with him , sat down on the grass by his side , and stretched out his legs.
`` I see thou hast good boots on , which are well blacked ,"
said he to the huntsman ; `` but if thou hadst to travel about as I have , they would not last long.
Look at mine , they are of buffalo-leather , and have been worn for a long time , but in them I can go through thick and thin"
`` I do n't know that myself ,"
answered the huntsman , `` I have lost my way in the forest"
`` Then thou art in the same plight as I ,"
said the soldier ; `` birds of a feather flock together , let us remain together , and seek our way"
The huntsman smiled a little , and they walked on further and further , until night fell.
`` We do not get out of the forest ,"
said the soldier , `` but there in the distance I see a light shining , which will help us to something to eat"
They found a stone house , knocked at the door , and an old woman opened it.
`` We are looking for quarters for the night ,"
said the soldier , `` and some lining for our stomachs , for mine is as empty as an old knapsack"
`` You can not stay here ,"
`` It wo n't be so bad as that ,"
I shall go in"
The huntsman would not follow , but the soldier drew him in with him by the sleeve.
`` Come , my dear brother , we shall not come to an end so quickly as that !"
Scarcely were they in the corner before twelve robbers came bursting in , seated themselves at the table which was already laid , and vehemently demanded some food.
The old woman brought in some great dishes of roast meat , and the robbers enjoyed that thoroughly.
`` Thou wilt bring us to destruction ,"
said the huntsman , and held him back by the arm.
But the soldier began to cough loudly.
When the robbers heard that , they threw away their knives and forks , leapt up , and discovered the two who were behind the stove.
`` Aha , gentlemen , are you in the corner ?"
`` But do be civil ,"
said the soldier , `` I am hungry , give me something to eat , and then you can do what you like with me"
`` We shall see ,"
said the soldier , and seated himself at the table , and began to cut away valiantly at the roast meat.
`` Brother Brightboots , come and eat ,"
cried he to the huntsman ; `` thou must be as hungry as I am , and can not have better roast meat at home ,"
but the huntsman would not eat.
The robbers looked at the soldier in astonishment , and said , `` The rascal uses no ceremony"
After a while he said , `` I have had enough food , now get me something good to drink"
and then he drank a hearty draught.
The huntsman said to the soldier , `` I see that thou art acquainted with tricks of another kind , but now come and let us go home"
Those men there are sitting fast , and are opening their mouths with astonishment , but they will not be allowed to move until I permit them.
Come , eat and drink"
Instantly they all regained the power of movement , but were thrown down and bound hand and foot with cords.
The huntsman , however , took one of the men aside and gave him another commission besides.
`` Brother Bright-boots ,"
said the soldier , `` we have safely routed the enemy and been well fed , now we will quietly walk behind them as if we were stragglers !"
Then he saw that the entire body-guard was coming up.
`` What can this mean ?"
said he to the huntsman.
`` Dost thou not know ?"
`` But where is the King ?"
said the soldier , `` I do not see him"
`` Here he is ,"
answered the huntsman , `` I am the King , and have announced my arrival"
Then he opened his hunting-coat , and his royal garments were visible.
But the King shook hands with him , and said , `` Thou art a brave soldier , and hast saved my life.
Thou shalt never again be in want , I will take care of thee.
But if thou wouldst drink a health , thou must first ask my permission"
Often when he went into the town with the other peasants they mocked him and asked why he had no children.
At last he became angry , and when he got home he said , `` I will have a child , even if it be a hedgehog"
The woman said , `` And we can not call him anything else but Hans the person_0"
When he was christened , the parson said , `` He can not go into any ordinary bed because of his spikes"
So a little straw was put behind the stove , and Hans the person_0 was laid on it.
His mother could not suckle him , for he would have pricked her with his quills.
So he lay there behind the stove for eight years , and his father was tired of him and thought , `` If he would but die !"
He did not die , however , but remained lying there.
`` A little meat and a couple of white rolls which are wanted for the house ,"
said she.
Then he asked the servant , and she wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with clocks.
At last he said also , `` And what wilt thou have , Hans my person_0 ?"
`` Dear father ,"
he said , `` do bring me bagpipes"
While he was sitting in the tree , however , he played his bagpipes , and made music which was very beautiful.
Once a King came traveling by who had lost his way and heard the music.
He was astonished at it , and sent his servant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came.
Then the King told the servant he was to ask why he sat there , and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom.
Then the King thought , `` I can easily do that , Hans the person_0 understands nothing , and I can write what I like"
But his daughter , when she saw him from afar , was so overjoyed that she ran to meet him , and kissed him.
Thereupon the princess was glad , and said he had done well , for she never would have gone away with the person_0.
Hans the person_0 , however , looked after his asses and pigs , and was always merry and sat on the tree and played his bagpipes.
He likewise heard the beautiful music from a distance , and asked his runner what that could be , and told him to go and see.
Then the runner went under the tree , and saw the cock sitting at the top of it , and Hans the person_0 on the cock.
The runner asked him what he was about up there ? `` I am keeping my asses and my pigs ; but what is your desire ?"
The King said , `` Yes ,"
and wrote a promise to Hans the person_0 that he should have this.
That done , Hans rode on before him on the cock , and pointed out the way , and the King reached his kingdom again in safety.
When he got to the courtyard , there were great rejoicings.
She asked him where in the world he had been so long.
But on this she promised that , for love of her father , she would willingly go with this Hans if he came.
When his father heard that , he was troubled , for he thought Hans the person_0 had died long ago.
Then the father had the cock shod once more , and was pleased that Hans the person_0 would never return again.
Hans the person_0 rode away to the first kingdom.
So she dressed herself in white , and her father gave her a carriage with six horses and magnificent attendants together with gold and possessions.
`` That is the reward of your falseness ,"
said he , `` go your way , I will not have you !"
and on that he chased her home again , and she was disgraced for the rest of her life.
But when the King 's daughter saw him she was terrified , for he looked quite too strange.
She remembered however , that she could not change her mind , for she had given her promise to her father.
When the clock struck eleven , he went into the chamber , stripped off the hedgehog 's skin , and left it lying by the bed.
When several years had passed he went with his wife to his father , and said that he was his son.
Then Hans made himself known , and the old father rejoiced and went with him to his kingdom.
My tale is done , And away it has run To little August 's house"
The poor young fellow might do what he liked , he got little to eat , but only so many blows the more.
The boy called , `` Thief ! thief ! rascal !"
with all the strength of his body.
But what good did that do ? The hawk did not bring its prey back again.
But he was very much mistaken.
Then he sent him to the judge , to whom he was to carry a basketful of grapes , and he gave him a letter as well.
On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy so violently that he ate two of the bunches of grapes.
He took the basket to the judge , but when the judge had read the letter , and counted the bunches he said , `` Two clusters are wanting"
The boy confessed quite honestly that , driven by hunger and thirst , he had devoured the two which were wanting.
The judge wrote a letter to the farmer , and asked for the same number of grapes again.
These also the boy had to take to him with a letter.
As he again was so extremely hungry and thirsty , he could not help it , and again ate two bunches.
The judge , however , again made him give an explanation about the missing bunches.
`` Ah ,"
`` I will soon show thee the difference ,"
The next day he set him a hard task.
He was to chop two bundles of straw for food for the horses , and then the man threatened : `` In five hours ,"
The boy seated himself on the bench , and began to work with all his might.
As he got warm over it he put his little coat off and threw it on the straw.
He became aware of the misfortune too late ; there was no repairing it.
`` Ah ,"
Rather than that I will take my own life"
The boy had once heard the farmer 's wife say , `` I have a pot with poison in it under my bed"
She , however , had only said that to keep away greedy people , for there was honey in it.
The boy crept under the bed , brought out the pot , and ate all that was in it.
`` I do not know ,"
said he , `` folks say death is bitter , but it tastes very sweet to me.
It is no wonder that the farmer 's wife has so often longed for death"
He seated himself in a little chair , and was prepared to die.
But instead of becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing food.
`` It can not have been poison ,"
It was , however , no poison for flies , but Hungarian wine.
The boy got out the bottle , and emptied it.
`` This death tastes sweet too ,"
said he , but shortly after when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy him , he thought his end was drawing near.
`` I feel that I must die ,"
said he , `` I will go away to the churchyard , and seek a grave"
He staggered out , reached the churchyard , and laid himself in a newly dug grave.
He lost his senses more and more.
His wife , who was standing on the hearth with a pan of hot fat , ran to him to help him.
When evening drew near he stopped and looked around him , and then he saw that he had lost his way.
He sought a way out , but could find none.
Then he perceived an aged woman with a head which nodded perpetually , who came towards him , but she was a witch.
`` Good woman ,"
said he to her , `` Can you not show me the way through the forest ?"
`` Oh , yes , Lord King ,"
`` What kind of condition is it ?"
asked the King.
`` I have a daughter ,"
When he threw it down before him , it unrolled itself and showed him his path.
Next day the King went to visit his children , but he found no one but the little girl.
`` Where are thy brothers ?"
asked the King.
`` Alas , dear father ,"
she answered , `` they have gone away and left me alone !"
But she was afraid of her step-mother , and entreated the King to let her stay just this one night more in the forest castle.
The poor girl thought , `` I can no longer stay here.
I will go and seek my brothers"
And when night came , she ran away , and went straight into the forest.
She walked the whole night long , and next day also without stopping , until she could go no farther for weariness.
Just before sunset , however , she heard a rustling , and saw six swans come flying in at the window.
Then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers , was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed.
The brothers were not less delighted to see their little sister , but their joy was of short duration.
`` Here canst thou not abide ,"
they said to her.
`` This is a shelter for robbers , if they come home and find thee , they will kill thee"
`` But can you not protect me ?"
asked the little sister.
`` No ,"
The little sister wept and said , `` Can you not be set free ?"
`` Alas , no ,"
And if one single word falls from thy lips , all thy work will be lost"
And when the brothers had said this , the quarter of an hour was over , and they flew out of the window again as swans.
The maiden , however , firmly resolved to deliver her brothers , even if it should cost her her life.
She left the hut , went into the midst of the forest , seated herself on a tree , and there passed the night.
Next morning she went out and gathered starwort and began to sew.
She could not speak to any one , and she had no inclination to laugh ; she sat there and looked at nothing but her work.
They called to her and said , `` Who art thou ?"
But she made no answer.
`` Come down to us ,"
said they.
`` We will not do thee any harm"
She only shook her head.
As they pressed her further with questions she threw her golden necklace down to them , and thought to content them thus.
The King asked , `` Who art thou ? What art thou doing on the tree ?"
But she did not answer.
He put the question in every language that he knew , but she remained as mute as a fish.
As she was so beautiful , the King 's heart was touched , and he was smitten with a great love for her.
He put his mantle on her , took her before him on his horse , and carried her to his castle.
And after some days he united himself to her.
The King , however , had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied with this marriage and spoke ill of the young Queen.
`` Who knows ,"
said she , `` from whence the creature who ca n't speak , comes ? She is not worthy of a king !"
Then she went to the King and accused the Queen of being a man-eater.
The King would not believe it , and would not suffer any one to do her any injury.
She , however , sat continually sewing at the shirts , and cared for nothing else.
The six shirts were ready , only the left sleeve of the sixth was wanting.
Then she saw that her deliverance was near , and her heart leapt with joy.
The youngest only lacked his left arm , and had in the place of it a swan 's wing on his shoulder.
And she told him of the treachery of the old woman who had taken away her three children and hidden them.
But the King and the Queen with their six brothers lived many years in happiness and peace"
I have already ruined six pairs of glass skates with running after thee , and have not been able to get thee"
When the young folks went to the bed-room there stood a stone image of St.
Then the stone image of St.
Christopher nodded its head quite quickly , and then more and more slowly till at last it stood still.
The next morning the person_0 said to him , `` Thou hast done the business well , but I can not give my daughter away.
Then they both went into the sleeping-room , and there stood a still larger stone image of St.
Christopher , and the person_0 's daughter said to it , `` If my father calls , do you answer him"
Then the great stone image of St.
Christopher again nodded its head quite quickly and then more and more slowly , until at last it stood still again.
And the person_0 's son lay down on the threshold , put his hand under his head and slept.
Then they once more went to the sleeping-room together , and there was a much greater and much taller image of St.
Christopher than the two first had been.
The person_0 's daughter said to it , `` When my father calls , do thou answer"
Then the great tall stone image of St.
Christopher nodded quite half an hour with its head , until at length the head stood still again.
And the person_0 's son laid himself down on the threshold of the door and slept.
Then he gave him a glass axe , a glass wedge , and a glass mallet.
Then he was much troubled and believed he would have to die , and sat down and wept.
Now when it was noon the person_0 said , `` One of you girls must take him something to eat"
`` No ,"
said the two eldest , `` We will not take it to him ; the one by whom he last watched , can take him something"
Then the youngest was forced to go and take him something to eat.
When she got into the forest , she asked him how he was getting on ? `` Oh ,"
said he , `` I am getting on very badly"
Then she said he was to come and just eat a little.
`` Nay ,"
said he , `` I can not do that , I shall still have to die , so I will eat no more"
Then she spoke so kindly to him and begged him just to try , that he came and ate something.
When he had eaten something she said , `` I will comb thy hair a while , and then thou wilt feel happier"
So the little earth-men went about and got together the whole of their kindred to help them with the work.
Then she took her white handkerchief again and said , `` Earth-workers , go home"
On this they all disappeared.
When the person_0 's son awoke , he was delighted , and she said , `` Come home when it has struck six o'clock"
He did as she told him , and then the person_0 asked , `` Hast thou made away with the forest ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the person_0 's son.
So he asked what it was to be , then ? `` I have a great fish-pond ,"
said the person_0.
The next morning the person_0 gave him a glass shovel and said , `` The fish-pond must be done by six o'clock"
Then he was much troubled.
`` My tools have broken to pieces again"
`` Oh ,"
said she , `` thou must just come and eat something , and then thou wilt be in another frame of mind"
`` No ,"
said he , `` I can not eat , I am far too unhappy for that !"
Then she gave him many good words until at last he came and ate something.
The little earth-men went away and summoned all their kindred to help them , and in two hours it was done.
Then they returned to her and said , `` We have done as thou hast commanded"
The person_0 's daughter took the handkerchief and once more struck thrice on the ground with it , and said , `` Earth-workers , go home again"
Then they all went away.
When the person_0 's son awoke the fish-pond was done.
Then the person_0 's daughter went away also , and told him that when it was six he was to come to the house.
When he arrived at the house the person_0 asked , `` Hast thou got the fish-pond done ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the person_0 's son.
That was very good.
`` What is that , then ?"
asked the person_0 's son.
Then he was quite miserable , and waited for his dearest to see if she would not come and help him in his need.
When it was mid-day she came and brought him something to eat.
He went to meet her and told her all , and ate something , and let her comb his hair and fell asleep.
Then she once more took the knot and struck the earth with it , and said , `` Earth-workers , come forth !"
Then came once again numbers of earth-men , and asked what her desire was.
They went away , and summoned their kindred to help them and when the time was come , all was ready.
on which they all disappeared.
When therefore the person_0 's son awoke and saw everything done , he was as happy as a bird in air.
When it had struck six , they went home together.
Then said the person_0 , `` Is the castle ready ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the person_0 's son.
When they sat down to table , the person_0 said , `` I can not give away my youngest daughter until the two eldest are married"
Then the person_0 's son and the person_0 's daughter were quite troubled , and the person_0 's son had no idea what to do.
But he went by night to the person_0 's daughter and ran away with her.
When they had got a little distance away , the person_0 's daughter peeped round and saw her father behind her.
`` Oh ,"
said she , `` what are we to do ? My father is behind us , and will take us back with him.
I will at once change thee into a briar , and myself into a rose , and I will shelter myself in the midst of the bush"
Then said the Queen , `` If thou hadst but gathered the rose , the briar would have been forced to come too"
When the person_0 got to the place , there stood a church , and in the pulpit was a priest preaching.
So he listened to the sermon , and then went home again.
`` Thou shouldst just have brought the priest ,"
said his wife , `` and then the church would soon have come.
It is no use to send thee , I must go there myself"
She wanted to catch the fish , but she could not.
Then she cried , `` I see very well that nothing can be done now ,"
and said that now they might come back to her.
So the young folks went once more away together.
Then they harnessed the horses at once , and many attendants seated themselves outside the carriage.
On this his mother ordered the horses to be taken out of the carriage again , and everyone went back into the house.
But the maiden sat in the village and watched and watched , and thought he would come and fetch her , but no one came.
Then she and all with her looked at the maid , but no one knew her.
So a long time passed by during which the maiden served the miller honorably and faithfully.
In the meantime , the Queen had sought a wife for her son , who came from quite a distant part of the world.
When the bride came , they were at once to be married.
And many people hurried together , all of whom wanted to see everything.
Then the girl said to the miller that he might be so good as to give her leave to go also.
So the miller said , `` Yes , do go there"
When she was about to go , she opened one of the three walnuts , and a beautiful dress lay inside it.
She put it on , and went into the church and stood by the altar.
Then she stood up again , and said she would not be given away until she also had as beautiful a dress as that lady there.
So they went back to the house again , and sent to ask the lady if she would sell that dress.
No , she would not sell it , but the bride might perhaps earn it.
So the bride said , `` Yes , she was willing to do that"
The next morning when they were all up , the bride put on the dress , and went away to the church with the bridegroom.
In the meantime the maiden opened the second walnut , and a still more beautiful dress was inside it.
She put it on , and went and stood by the altar in the church , and everything happened as it had happened the time before.
All this the person_0 's son heard , and was sore troubled , and what was past came back to him.
Then he wanted to go to her , but his mother had locked the door.
But the false mother and the bride had to depart.
And the mouth of the person who last told all this is still warm"
There was once on a time a Queen to whom God had given no children.
Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to bestow on her a son or a daughter.
Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept , and washed herself there in a clear stream.
It happened once when the child was a little older , that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep.
Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink , and die of hunger.
Scarcely were the words out of the boy 's mouth , when everything was there that he had wished for.
After a while the cook said to him , `` It is not well for thee to be so alone , wish for a pretty girl as a companion"
Then the person_0 's son wished for one , and she immediately stood before him , and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her.
The two played together , and loved each other with all their hearts , and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman.
The cook once more said , `` If thou dost not do it , it shall cost thee thy own life"
Then the wicked wretch came in and said , `` Where are the boy 's heart and tongue ?"
Thou shalt become a black poodle and have a gold collar round thy neck , and shalt eat burning coals , till the flames burst forth from thy throat"
The person_0 's son remained there a short while longer , and he thought of his mother , and wondered if she were still alive.
`` Ah ,"
she replied , `` the way is so long , and what shall I do in a strange land where I am unknown ?"
Then he went away to his own country , and the poodle had to run after him.
Then he mounted up and looked inside , and cried , `` Beloved mother , Lady Queen , are you still alive , or are you dead ?"
She answered , `` I have just eaten , and am still satisfied ,"
for she thought the angels were there.
Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal table.
So he summoned all the huntsmen together , and bade them go out into the forest with him.
And he went with them and made them form a great circle , open at one end where he stationed himself , and began to wish.
Two hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once , and the huntsmen shot them.
Now the person_0 felt great joy at this , and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day , and made a great feast.
When they were all assembled together , he said to the huntsmen , `` As thou art so clever , thou shalt sit by me"
He replied , `` Lord person_0 , your majesty must excuse me , I am a poor huntsman"
But the person_0 insisted on it , and said , `` Thou shalt sit by me ,"
until he did it.
But the person_0 replied , `` She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts ; I will not have her named"
Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar , and said , `` That is the wretch !"
When the person_0 saw him he fell into a passion , and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon.
The person_0 replied , `` Yes , I would like to see her"
The son said , `` Most gracious father , I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower ,"
Then the son said , `` Now will I show her to you in her own form ,"
and wished that she might become a maiden , and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.
And the person_0 sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower , to fetch the Queen and bring her to the royal table.
The aged person_0 ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces , but grief consumed the person_0 's own heart , and he soon died.
And as he let his eyes roam here and there , he saw the giant 's playthings lying in the yard.
These were a couple of enormous balls , and nine-pins as tall as a man.
`` Little worm ,"
cried he , `` why art thou playing with my balls ? Who gave thee strength to do it ?"
`` What dost thou want with it ?"
said the King 's son.
`` I do not want the apple for myself ,"
answered the giant , `` but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it.
I have traveled far about the world and can not find the tree"
`` I will soon find it ,"
said the King 's son , `` and I do not know what is to prevent me from getting the apple down"
`` They will be sure to let me in ,"
said the King 's son.
`` That luck will be mine ,"
said the King 's son.
The beasts lay round about it , but they had put their heads down and were asleep.
There , in the very middle of it , stood the tree of life , and the red apples were shining upon the branches.
The ring closed tightly on his arm , and all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his veins.
The King 's son took the giant the apple he had promised him , and said , `` Seest thou , I have brought it without difficulty"
The giant was glad that his desire had been so soon satisfied , hastened to his bride , and gave her the apple for which she had wished.
The giant said , `` I have nothing to do but go home and fetch it ,"
and thought it would be easy to take away by force from the weak man , what he would not give of his own free will.
He therefore demanded the ring from him , but the King 's son refused it.
`` Where the apple is , the ring must be also ,"
said the giant ; `` if thou wilt not give it of thine own accord , thou must fight with me for it"
Then the giant thought of a stratagem , and said , `` I have got warm with fighting , and so hast thou.
We will bathe in the river , and cool ourselves before we begin again"
And now the unhappy King 's son stood there , and was blind and knew not how to help himself.
But the faithful lion had not deserted its master ; it held him fast by the clothes , and drew him gradually back again.
When the giant came and wanted to rob the dead man , he saw that his cunning had been in vain.
`` Is there no way , then , of destroying a weak child of man like that ?"
The faithful animal again drew its master back from the precipice , and guided him to a tree by which flowed a clear brook.
The King 's son sat down there , but the lion lay down , and sprinkled the water in his face with its paws.
Then the King 's son recognized a sign from God and stooped down to the water , and washed and bathed his face in it.
And when he arose he had his eyes once more , brighter and clearer than they had ever been.
The King 's son thanked God for his great mercy , and traveled with his lion onwards through the world.
And it came to pass that he arrived before a castle which was enchanted.
In the gateway stood a maiden of beautiful form and fine face , but she was quite black.
She spoke to him and said , `` Ah , if thou couldst but deliver me from the evil spell which is thrown over me"
`` What shall I do ?"
said the King 's son.
When they are doing their worst to torment thee , if thou bearest it without letting a sound escape thee , I shall be free.
Thy life they dare not take"
Then said the King 's son , `` I have no fear ; with God 's help I will try it"
So he went gaily into the castle , and when it grew dark he seated himself in the large hall and waited.
They behaved as if they did not see him , seated themselves in the middle of the room , lighted a fire , and began to gamble.
`` Wait , you fellow behind the stove , I am coming ,"
said another.
The screaming became still louder , so that no one could have heard it without terror.
They dragged him about on the floor , pinched him , pricked him , beat him , and tormented him , but no sound escaped from him.
She said , `` Thou hast held out successfully for one night , but two more lie before thee"
Then she went away again , and as she was going , he observed that her feet had become white.
The next night the devils came and began their gambols anew.
They fell on the King 's son , and beat him much more severely than the night before , until his body was covered with wounds.
And when she went away , he saw with joy that she had already become white to the tips of her fingers.
And now he had only one night more to go through , but it was the worst.
The hob-goblins came again : `` Art thou there still ?"
cried they , `` thou shalt be tormented till thy breath stops"
`` Rise ,"
said she , `` and swing thy sword three times over the stairs , and then all will be delivered"
And when he had done that , the whole castle was released from enchantment , and the maiden was a rich King 's daughter.
The servants came and said that the table was already set in the great hall , and dinner served up.
Then they sat down and ate and drank together , and in the evening the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings"
There was once upon a time a Queen who had a little daughter who was still so young that she had to be carried.
One day the child was naughty , and the mother might say what she liked , but the child would not be quiet.
Scarcely had she spoken the words , before the child was changed into a raven , and flew from her arms out of the window.
It flew into a dark forest , and stayed in it a long time , and the parents heard nothing of their child.
`` What am I to do ,"
asked he.
In the garden behind the house there is a great heap of tan , and on this thou shalt stand and wait for me.
For three days I will come every afternoon at two o'clock in a carriage.
Then the man once more promised that he would certainly not touch anything either to eat or to drink.
`` No ,"
said the man , `` I will not eat or drink"
Then he let himself be persuaded , and drank.
Shortly before two o'clock in the afternoon he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven.
At two o'clock the raven came driving up with four white horses , but she was already in deep grief and said , `` I know he is asleep"
And when she came into the garden , he was indeed lying there asleep on the heap of tan.
She alighted from the carriage , went to him , shook him , and called him , but he did not awake.
Next day about noon , the old woman came again and brought him food and drink , but he would not take any of it.
But she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink out of the glass.
He could not help himself , and was forced to lie down , and fell into a heavy sleep.
When the raven drove up with four brown horses , she was already full of grief , and said , `` I know he is asleep"
She went to him , but there he lay sleeping , and there was no wakening him.
At two o'clock the raven came with four black horses , and the coachman and everything else was black.
She was already in the deepest grief , and said , `` I know that he is asleep and can not deliver me"
When she came to him , there he was lying fast asleep.
She shook him and called him , but she could not waken him.
After this she took a gold ring from her finger , and put it on his , and her name was graven on it.
And when she had given him all these things , she seated herself in her carriage , and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.
Then he perceived the things which were lying beside him , and read the letter wherein was written how everything had happened.
So he arose and went away , intending to go to the golden castle of Stromberg , but he did not know where it was.
Then it was once more evening , and he was so tired that he lay down in a thicket and fell asleep.
And at the time when people light the candles , he saw one glimmering , and arose and went towards it.
Then he came to a house which seemed very small , for in front of it a great giant was standing.
He thought to himself , `` If I go in , and the giant sees me , it will very likely cost me my life"
At length he ventured it and went in.
`` I 'd rather you would leave that alone ,"
`` If that be true ,"
said the giant , `` thou mayst be easy , I was only going to devour thee because I had nothing else"
`` This pleases me well ,"
said the giant , and ate to his heart 's content.
Then the man said to him , `` Canst thou tell me where the golden castle of Stromberg is ?"
The giant said , `` I will look at my map ; all the towns , and villages , and houses are to be found on it"
He brought out the map which he had in the room and looked for the castle , but it was not to be found on it.
`` It 's no matter !"
said he , `` I have some still larger maps in my cupboard upstairs , and we will look in them"
But there , too , it was in vain.
When the brother came home they inquired about the golden castle of Stromberg.
He replied , `` When I have eaten and have had enough , I will look in the map"
Then he went with them up to his chamber , and they searched in his map , but could not find it.
`` How am I to get there ?"
asked the man.
And he turned back , but the man went onwards day and night , until at length he came to the golden castle of Stromberg.
It stood on a glass-mountain , and the bewitched maiden drove in her carriage round the castle , and then went inside it.
Then one day he saw from his hut three robbers who were beating each other , and cried to them , `` God be with ye !"
So he again cried , `` God be with ye !"
Again they stopped , looked round about , but as they saw no one they went on beating each other.
Then he cried for the third time , `` God be with ye ,"
and thought , `` I must see what these three are about ,"
and went thither and asked why they were beating each other so furiously.
One of them said that he found a stick , and that when he struck a door with it , that door would spring open.
And now they did not know whether they ought to have these things in common , or whether they ought to divide them.
Then the man said , `` I will give you something in exchange for these three things.
Money indeed have I not , but I have other things of more value ; but first I must try yours to see if you have told the truth"
So he gave them some vigorous blows and cried , `` Now , vagabonds , you have got what you deserve , are you satisfied ?"
And he rode up the glass-mountain , but when he came in front of the castle at the top , it was shut.
Then he struck the door with his stick , and it sprang open immediately.
He went in and ascended the stairs until he came to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden cup full of wine before her.
She , however , could not see him because he had the mantle on.
Then she cried , `` That is my ring , so the man who is to set me free must be here"
When they came to the door , they saw him and cried aloud in their delight.
`` Very well ,"
said the father , `` I am quite content with that ,"
and gave him some money for his journey.
So he traveled about and looked for work.
said the huntsman , `` if thou wilt go with me"
Then the young fellow went with him , bound himself to him for some years , and learned the art of hunting.
Then he set out and found himself in a very large forest , which he could not get to the end of in one day.
When evening came he seated himself in a high tree in order to escape from the wild beasts.
Towards midnight , it seemed to him as if a tiny little light glimmered in the distance.
Then he looked down through the branches towards it , and kept well in his mind where it was.
Then he got down and went to his hat , put it on again and went straight forwards.
Presently one of them said , `` I must just taste if the meat will soon be fit to eat ,"
and pulled a piece off , and was about to put it in his mouth when the huntsman shot it out of his hand.
`` Well , really ,"
said the giant , `` if the wind has not blown the bit out of my hand !"
and helped himself to another.
But when he was just about to bite into it , the huntsman again shot it away from him.
`` I have not snatched it away ,"
said the other , `` a sharpshooter must have shot it away from thee"
The giant took another piece , but could not , however , keep it in his hand , for the huntsman shot it out.
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` I will soon get her for you"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` that will be a little bit of fun for me"
Then he went into the castle , and all was perfectly quiet within , and every one was asleep.
He thought to himself , `` How can I give an innocent maiden into the power of the wild giants , who have evil in their minds ?"
But when the King in the castle awoke , he saw the three giants lying there dead.
Then the old King said that as he had accomplished this , he should marry his daughter.
But the maiden said , `` Rather than marry him , dear father , I will go away into the world as far as my legs can carry me"
When therefore the King 's daughter had placed her stall in the street , by came the carts , and broke all she had into tiny fragments.
She began to weep and said , `` Alas , how shall I ever pay for the pots now ?"
He said , `` No ,"
she must first pay for the things she had already had.
Then she went to her father and cried and lamented , and said she would go forth into the world.
When the hut was ready , a sign was hung on the door whereon was written , `` To-day given , to-morrow sold"
The huntsman heard it likewise , and thought to himself , `` That would suit thee.
Thou art poor , and hast no money"
He was charmed with the beautiful maiden , who was indeed as lovely as any picture.
She asked him whence he came and whither he was going , and he said , `` I am roaming about the world"
Then she asked him where he had got the sword , for that truly her father 's name was on it.
He asked her if she were the King 's daughter.
`` Yes ,"
answered she.
`` With this sword ,"
said he , `` did I cut off the heads of three giants"
And he took their tongues out of his knapsack in proof.
Then he also showed her the slipper , and the corner of the neck-kerchief , and the bit of the night-dress.
Hereupon she was overjoyed , and said that he was the one who had delivered her.
Then she dressed the huntsman as if he were a foreign lord , and the King ordered a feast to be prepared.
When they had eaten and drunk , the old King said to the captain that he would set before him something which he must guess.
The captain said , `` Then they can not have had any"
`` Not so ,"
said the King.
`` Every animal has a tongue ,"
and then he likewise asked what any one would deserve who made such an answer ? The captain replied , `` He ought to be torn in pieces"
`` Eh ! what ?"
said the man.
`` You are not very sharp.
He has not a tooth left in his mouth , and not a thief is afraid of him ; now he may be off.
If he has served us , he has had good feeding for it"
`` Hark ye , gossip ,"
said the wolf , `` be of good cheer , I will help you out of your trouble.
I have thought of something.
Then I will come out of the wood , and carry off the child.
You must rush swiftly after me , as if you would seize it again from me.
The plan pleased the dog , and it was carried out just as it was arranged.
Henceforth Old Sultan was as well off as he could wish to be.
Soon afterwards the wolf visited him , and was pleased that everything had succeeded so well.
`` But , gossip ,"
said he , `` you will just wink an eye if when I have a chance , I carry off one of your master 's fat sheep"
`` Do not reckon upon that ,"
answered the dog ; `` I will remain true to my master ; I can not agree to that"
The wolf , who thought that this could not be spoken in earnest , came creeping about in the night and was going to take away the sheep.
But the farmer , to whom the faithful Sultan had told the wolf 's plan , caught him and dressed his hide soundly with the flail.
The wolf had to pack off , but he cried out to the dog , `` Wait a bit , you scoundrel , you shall pay for this"
The next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge the dog to come out into the forest so that they might settle the affair.
So they were both afraid ; the wild boar crept into the under-wood and the wolf jumped up a tree.
The dog and the cat , when they came up , wondered that there was no one to be seen.
The wild boar , however , had not been able to hide himself altogether ; and one of his ears was still to be seen.
The boar made a fearful noise and ran away , crying out , `` The guilty one is up in the tree"
The dog and cat looked up and saw the wolf , who was ashamed of having shown himself so timid , and made friends with the dog"
Then the fox answered , `` I know a farm-yard where there are two young lambs ; if thou art inclined , we will fetch one of them"
That suited the wolf , and they went thither , and the fox stole the little lamb , took it to the wolf , and went away.
The wolf devoured it , but was not satisfied with one ; he wanted the other as well , and went to get it.
They found the wolf , and beat him so mercilessly , that he went to the fox limping and howling.
`` Thou hast misled me finely ,"
said he ; `` I wanted to fetch the other lamb , and the country folks surprised me , and have beaten me to a jelly"
The fox replied , `` Why art thou such a glutton ?"
Then answered the fox , `` I know a farm-house where the wife is baking pancakes to-night ; we will get some of them for ourselves"
`` There is something for thee to eat ,"
said he to him , and then went his way.
The wolf swallowed down the pancakes in an instant , and said , `` They make one want more ,"
and went thither and tore the whole dish down so that it broke in pieces.
`` How abominably thou hast misled me !"
cried he , `` the peasants caught me , and tanned my skin for me"
But the fox replied , `` Why art thou such a glutton ?"
Said the wolf , `` I will go when thou dost , that thou mayest help me if I am not able to get away"
`` I am willing ,"
said the fox , and showed him the by-paths and ways by which at length they reached the cellar.
There was meat in abundance , and the wolf attacked it instantly and thought , `` There is plenty of time before I need leave off !"
The wolf said , `` Dear fox , tell me why thou art running here and there so much , and jumping in and out ?"
`` I must see that no one is coming ,"
replied the crafty fellow.
`` Do n't eat too much !"
Then said the wolf , `` I shall not leave until the barrel is empty"
In the meantime the farmer , who had heard the noise of the fox 's jumping , came into the cellar.
When the fox saw him he was out of the hole at one bound.
The wolf wanted to follow him , but he had made himself so fat with eating that he could no longer get through , but stuck fast.
Then came the farmer with a cudgel and struck him dead , but the fox bounded into the forest , glad to be rid of the old glutton"
Then the clerk got behind the altar , and said , `` Thieving , thieving"
On this Hans goes back to his son , and tells him he is to learn thieving , and that the Lord God had said so.
So he goes with his son to seek a man who is acquainted with thieving.
They walk a long time and come into a great forest , where stands a little house with an old woman in it.
Hans says , `` Do you know of a man who is acquainted with thieving ?"
`` You can learn that here quite well ,"
says the woman , `` my son is a master of it"
So he speaks with the son , and asks if he knows thieving really well ? The master-thief says , `` I will teach him well.
The father goes home again , and the son learns witchcraft and thieving , thoroughly.
When the year is out , the father is full of anxiety to know how he is to contrive to recognize his son.
`` Oh ,"
Then the dwarf tells him to take a small basket of bread with him , and to stand beneath the chimney.
`` There on the cross-beam is a basket , out of which a little bird is peeping , and that is your son"
`` Hollo , my son , art thou here ?"
`` Father , let us go ,"
said the youth.
Then the father and son set out homeward.
On the way a carriage comes driving by.
Then the gentleman calls from the carriage , `` My man , will you sell your dog ?"
`` Yes ,"
says the father.
`` How much do you want for it ?"
`` Thirty thalers"
`` Eh , man , that is a great deal , but as it is such a very fine dog I will have it"
They go home together.
So the man goes home with the horse , and puts it in the stable.
When the maid crosses the threshold , the horse says , `` Take off my bridle , take off my bridle"
Then the maid stands still , and says , `` What , canst thou speak ?"
Then they come together and cast lots , but the master loses , and betakes himself to the water and is a fish.
Then the youth also becomes a fish , and they cast lots again , and the master loses.
There were once two brothers , the one rich , the other poor.
The twelve men , however , went to the mountain and cried , `` Semsi mountain , Semsi mountain , open ,"
and immediately the barren mountain opened down the middle , and the twelve went into it , and as soon as they were within , it shut.
then the mountain closed together , and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it , and the twelve went away.
So he went up to it and said , `` Semsi mountain , Semsi mountain , open ,"
and the mountain opened to him also.
When he came out again he also said , `` Semsi mountain , Semsi mountain , shut thyself ;"
and the mountain closed itself , and he went home with his barrow.
He lived joyously and uprightly , gave help to the poor , and did good to every one.
When for the third time he wanted to fetch something , he again borrowed the measure of his brother.
He at once went to his brother and asked him , `` What hast thou been measuring in the bushel measure ?"
`` Corn and barley ,"
said the other.
The poor man then told him everything , just as it happened.
When he came to the mountain he cried , `` Semsi mountain , Semsi mountain , open"
The mountain opened , and he went inside it.
There lay the treasures all before him , and for a long time he did not know which to clutch at first.
At length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry.
That , however , was not the right name , and the mountain never stirred , but remained shut.
Then he cried , `` It was not I , it was my brother ,"
but let him beg for his life and say what he would , they cut his head off"
Now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from him , came the Lord and St.
Peter , and asked him to give them shelter for the night.
Then Gambling person_0 said , `` For my part , you may stay the night , but I can not give you a bed or anything to eat"
So the Lord said he was just to take them in , and they themselves would buy something to eat , to which Gambling person_0 made no objection.
Thereupon St.
Peter gave him three groschen , and said he was to go to the baker 's and fetch some bread.
`` Oh ,"
said he , `` do you want to win the three groschen too ?"
On this they would not let him go.
So he went in , and played away the three groschen also.
Meanwhile St.
Peter and the Lord were waiting , and as he was so long in coming , they set out to meet him.
St.
Peter again gave him three groschen , and now he did not allow himself to be led away once more , but fetched them the loaf.
Our Lord then inquired if he had no wine , and he said , `` Alack , sir , the casks are all empty !"
But the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar , for the best wine was still there.
Early next day our Lord told Gambling person_0 that he might beg three favors.
The Lord gave him all that he had asked , and departed with St.
Peter.
And now Gambling person_0 at once set about gambling in real earnest , and before long he had gained half the world.
Upon this St.
Peter said to the Lord , `` Lord , this thing must not go on , he will win , and thou lose , the whole world.
We must send Death to him"
When Death appeared , Gambling person_0 had just seated himself at the gaming-table , and Death said , `` person_0 , come out a while"
So St.
Peter said to the Lord , `` Lord , this thing must not go on.
People no longer die ; we must go ourselves"
And they went themselves , and the Lord commanded person_0 to let Death come down.
So person_0 went at once to Death and said to him , `` Come down ,"
and Death took him directly and put an end to him.
They went away together and came to the next world , and then Gambling person_0 made straight for the door of Heaven , and knocked at it.
`` Who is there ?"
`` Gambling person_0"
`` Ah , we will have nothing to do with him ! Begone !"
So he went to the door of Purgatory , and knocked once more.
`` Who is there ?"
`` Gambling person_0"
`` Ah , there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him.
We do not want to gamble , just go away again"
Then he went to the door of Hell , and there they let him in.
There was , however , no one at home but old Lucifer and the crooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world.
And no sooner was person_0 there than he sat down to gamble again.
So again St.
Peter said , `` Lord , this thing can not go on , we must let him in , or he will throw us down from Heaven"
And they let him in.
But Gambling person_0 instantly began to play again , and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying.
Therefore St.
Peter once more said , `` Lord , this can not go on , we must throw him down , or he will make all Heaven rebellious"
IN former times there lived an aged Queen who was a sorceress , and her daughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun.
`` Never ,"
answered the person_0 ; `` if you were to go , it would be going to your death"
On this the son lay down and was sick unto death , and for seven years he lay there , and no physician could heal him.
When the son heard that , he rose from his bed and was well again , and joyfully set out on his way.
When the fat man saw the traveller , he stood up and said , `` If you are in need of any one , take me into your service"
The prince answered , `` What can I do with such a great big man ?"
`` Oh ,"
said the Stout person_1 , `` this is nothing , when I stretch myself out well , I am three thousand times fatter"
`` If that 's the case ,"
said the prince , `` I can make use of thee , come with me"
`` What art thou doing there ?"
asked the person_0 's son.
`` I am listening ,"
replied the man.
`` What art thou listening to so attentively ?"
`` I am listening to what is just going on in the world , for nothing escapes my ears ; I even hear the grass growing"
`` Tell me ,"
said the prince , `` what thou hearest at the court of the old Queen who has the beautiful daughter"
Then he answered , `` I hear the whizzing of the sword that is striking off a wooer 's head"
The person_0 's son said , `` I can make use of thee , come with me"
When they had walked on for a great distance , they came to the body , and at last to the head also.
`` Why ,"
said the prince , `` what a tall rascal thou art !"
`` Oh ,"
I will gladly enter your service , if you will take me"
`` Come with me ,"
said the prince , `` I can make use of thee"
They went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes.
The prince said to him , `` Hast thou weak eyes , that thou canst not look at the light ?"
`` No ,"
If you can use that , I shall be glad to serve you"
`` Come with me ,"
replied the person_0 's son , `` I can make use of thee"
`` How canst thou shiver when the sun is shining so warm ?"
said the person_0 's son.
`` Alack ,"
replied the man , `` I am of quite a different nature.
In the midst of ice , I can not endure the heat , nor in the midst of fire , the cold"
`` Thou art a strange fellow ,"
said the prince , `` but if thou wilt enter my service , follow me"
They traveled onwards , and saw a man standing who made a long neck and looked about him , and could see over all the mountains.
`` What art thou looking at so eagerly ?"
said the person_0 's son.
The man replied , `` I have such sharp eyes that I can see into every forest and field , and hill and valley , all over the world"
The prince said , `` Come with me if thou wilt , for I am still in want of such an one"
And now the person_0 's son and his six servants came to the town where the aged Queen dwelt.
`` What is the first to be ?"
`` Thou shalt fetch me my ring which I have dropped into the Red Sea"
So the person_0 's son went home to his servants and said , `` The first task is not easy.
A ring is to be got out of the Red Sea.
Come , find some way of doing it"
Then the man with the sharp sight said , `` I will see where it is lying ,"
and looked down into the water and said , `` It is sticking there , on a pointed stone"
The Tall person_1 carried them thither , and said , `` I would soon get it out , if I could only see it"
`` Oh , is that all !"
The Tall person_1 stooped down a little , and brought out the ring with his hand.
Then the person_0 's son rejoiced when he had the ring , and took it to the old Queen.
She was astonished , and said , `` Yes , it is the right ring.
Thou hast safely performed the first task , but now comes the second.
`` May I invite no guests to this repast ?"
inquired the prince , `` no dinner is good without some company"
The old woman laughed maliciously , and replied , `` Thou mayst invite one for the sake of companionship , but no more"
The person_0 's son went to his servants and said to the Stout person_1 , `` Thou shalt be my guest to-day , and shalt eat thy fill"
He drank the wine straight from the casks without feeling any need of a glass , and he licked the last drop from his finger-nails.
When the meal was over , the prince went to the old woman , and told her that the second task also was performed.
She wondered at this and said , `` No one has ever done so much before , but one task still remains ,"
and she thought to herself , `` Thou shalt not escape me , and wilt not keep thy head on thy shoulders ! This night ,"
When twelve o'clock is striking , I will come , and if she is then no longer in thine arms , thou art lost"
The prince thought , `` The task is easy , I will most certainly keep my eyes open"
He did nothing but gaze at her , and was filled with love and happiness , and his eyes never felt weary.
Then they all slept soundly until a quarter to twelve , when the magic lost its power , and all awoke again.
`` Oh , misery and misfortune !"
cried the prince , `` now I am lost !"
The faithful servants also began to lament , but the Listener said , `` Be quiet , I want to listen"
Then he listened for an instant and said , `` She is on a rock , three hundred leagues from hence , bewailing her fate.
Thou alone , Tall person_1 , canst help her ; if thou wilt stand up , thou wilt be there in a couple of steps"
`` Yes ,"
answered the Tall person_1 , `` but the one with the sharp eyes must go with me , that we may destroy the rock"
Then the Tall person_1 took the one with bandaged eyes on his back , and in the twinkling of an eye they were on the enchanted rock.
When twelve struck , the aged sorceress came stealing in with a malicious face , which seemed to say , `` Now he is mine !"
for she believed that her daughter was on the rock three hundred leagues off.
But when she saw her in the prince 's arms , she was alarmed , and said , `` Here is one who knows more than I do !"
She dared not make any opposition , and was forced to give him her daughter.
On this the proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger , and she meditated revenge.
But the servants said , `` Every one of us has done something except the Frosty person_1 , he must set to work ,"
and they put him in the middle of the pile , and set fire to it.
As no other pretext was to be found , the beautiful maiden was now forced to take the unknown youth as a husband.
But when they drove away to church , the old woman said , `` I can not endure the disgrace ,"
and sent her warriors after them with orders to cut down all who opposed them , and bring back her daughter.
But the Listener had sharpened his ears , and heard the secret discourse of the old woman.
`` What shall we do ?"
said he to the Stout person_1.
We two shall have to set to work also , and help him"
Then he alighted with her at the inn , and secretly told the innkeepers to take away her royal apparel during the night.
This lasted for a week , and then she could endure it no longer , for she had sores on her feet.
And now came a couple of people who asked if she knew who her husband was.
`` Yes ,"
she answered , `` he is a swineherd , and has just gone out with cords and ropes to try to drive a little bargain"
But they said , `` Just come with us , and we will take you to him ,"
and they took her up to the palace , and when she entered the hall , there stood her husband in kingly raiment.
And then the wedding was celebrated , and he who has told you all this , wishes that he , too , had been present at it"
Now everybody in the town and neighborhood was in great fear , and no one durst venture out after sunset near the Gate of Rashomon.
Now at this time there lived in Kyoto a general named Raiko , who had made himself famous for his brave deeds.
He had routed them all and cut off the head of the chief monster.
This brave warrior was always followed by a band of faithful knights.
In this band there were five knights of great valor.
`` Then do you disbelieve what I say , and think that I am telling you a falsehood ?"
`` No , I do not think that you are telling a lie ,"
said person_0 ; `` but you have heard some old woman 's story which is not worth believing"
`` Then the best plan is to prove what I say , by going there yourself and finding out yourself whether it is true or not ,"
said Hojo.
When he was ready to start he said to the others : `` Give me something so that I can prove I have been there !"
`` I will take this ,"
and he mounted his horse and rode off gallantly.
It was a very dark night , and there was neither moon nor star to light person_0 on his way.
To make the darkness worse a storm came on , the rain fell heavily and the wind howled like wolves in the mountains.
At last person_0 reached the Gate of Rashomon , but peer as he might through the darkness he could see no sign of an ogre.
`` It is just as I thought ,"
said person_0 to himself ; `` there are certainly no ogres here ; it is only an old woman 's story.
He fastened the piece of paper , signed by all his four companions , on the gate , and then turned his horse 's head towards home.
As he did so he became aware that some one was behind him , and at the same time a voice called out to him to wait.
Then his helmet was seized from the back.
`` Who are you ?"
said person_0 fearlessly.
He then put out his hand and groped around to find out who or what it was that held him by the helmet.
There was a loud yell of pain , and then the ogre dashed in front of the warrior.
The ogre thought to terrify his foe , but person_0 never flinched.
He attacked the ogre with all his strength , and thus they fought face to face for a long time.
At last the ogre , finding that he could neither frighten nor beat person_0 and that he might himself be beaten , took to flight.
But person_0 , determined not to let the monster escape , put spurs to his horse and gave chase.
person_0 returned to the gate where the fierce fight had taken place , and got down from his horse.
As he did so he stumbled upon something lying on the ground.
Stooping to pick it up he found that it was one of the ogre 's huge arms which he must have slashed off in the fight.
His joy was great at having secured such a prize , for this was the best of all proofs of his adventure with the ogre.
So he took it up carefully and carried it home as a trophy of his victory.
His wonderful deed was soon noised abroad in Kyoto , and people from far and near came to see the ogre 's arm.
person_0 therefore had a box made of the strongest wood and banded with iron.
In this he placed the arm , and then he sealed down the heavy lid , refusing to open it for anyone.
He kept the box in his own room and took charge of it himself , never allowing it out of his sight.
Now one night he heard some one knocking at the porch , asking for admittance.
When the servant went to the door to see who it was , there was only an old woman , very respectable in appearance.
If the lord of the house were at home she begged to be allowed to see him.
The servant left the old woman at the door and went to tell his master that his old nurse had come to see him.
He ordered the servant to show her in.
`` I was very disappointed ,"
`` I am very proud to think ,"
answered the old woman , `` that my master was so brave as to dare to cut off an ogre 's arm.
There is nothing that can be compared to your courage.
Before I die it is the great wish of my life to see this arm ,"
she added pleadingly.
`` No ,"
said person_0 , `` I am sorry , but I can not grant your request"
`` But why ?"
asked the old woman.
`` Because ,"
`` Your precaution is very reasonable ,"
said the old woman.
`` But I am your old nurse , so surely you will not refuse to show ME the arm.
person_0 was very troubled at the old woman 's pleading , but he still persisted in refusing.
Then the old woman said : `` Do you suspect me of being a spy sent by the ogre ?"
`` No , of course I do not suspect you of being the ogre 's spy , for you are my old nurse ,"
answered person_0.
`` Then you can not surely refuse to show me the arm any longer"
entreated the old woman ; `` for it is the great wish of my heart to see for once in my life the arm of an ogre !"
Come , follow me !"
and he led the way to his own room , the old woman following.
He then called to the old woman to come near and look in , for he never took the arm out of the box.
`` What is it like ? Let me have a good look at it ,"
said the old nurse , with a joyful face.
She came nearer and nearer , as if she were afraid , till she stood right against the box.
He seized his sword , drew it out of its sheath in a flash , and tried to cut the ogre down.
So quick was person_0 that the creature had a narrow escape.
But the ogre sprang up to the ceiling , and bursting through the roof , disappeared in the mist and clouds.
In this way the ogre escaped with his arm.
The knight gnashed his teeth with disappointment , but that was all he could do.
He waited in patience for another opportunity to dispatch the ogre.
But the latter was afraid of person_0 's great strength and daring , and never troubled Kyoto again.
I will tell you a story which was told to me when I was a little boy.
There is a stork 's nest on the summit of the gable ; for we ca n't do without the stork.
The walls of the house are sloping , and the windows are low , and only one of the latter is made so that it will open.
The baking-oven sticks out of the wall like a little fat body.
There is a yard-dog too , who barks at all comers.
Just such a farmhouse stood out in the country ; and in this house dwelt an old couple -- a peasant and his wife.
But they thought it would be best if they sold the horse , or exchanged it for something that might be more useful to them.
But what might this _ something _ be ? `` You 'll know that best , old man ,"
said the wife.
Ride to the fair"
Then she brushed his hat round and round with the palm of her hand , and gave him a kiss.
So he rode away upon the horse that was to be sold or to be bartered for something else.
Yes , the old man knew what he was about.
The sun shone hotly down , and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky.
The road was very dusty , for many people who were all bound for the fair were driving , or riding , or walking upon it.
There was no shelter anywhere from the sunbeams.
Among the rest , a man was trudging along , and driving a cow to the fair.
The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow can be.
`` She gives good milk , I 'm sure ,"
said the peasant.
`` That would be a very good exchange -- the cow for the horse.
`` Hallo , you there with the cow !"
If you like , we 'll exchange"
`` To be sure I will ,"
said the man ; and they exchanged accordingly.
Leading the animal , he strode sturdily on ; and after a short time , he overtook a man who was driving a sheep.
It was a good fat sheep , with a fine fleece on its back.
`` I should like to have that fellow ,"
said our peasant to himself.
`` He would find plenty of grass by our palings , and in the winter we could keep him in the room with us.
Perhaps it would be more practical to have a sheep instead of a cow.
Shall we exchange ?"
The man with the sheep was quite ready , and the bargain was struck.
So our peasant went on in the high-road with his sheep.
Soon he overtook another man , who came into the road from a field , carrying a great goose under his arm.
`` That 's a heavy thing you have there.
It has plenty of feathers and plenty of fat , and would look well tied to a string , and paddling in the water at our place.
That would be something for my old woman ; she could make all kinds of profit out of it.
Shall we exchange ? I 'll give you my sheep for your goose , and thank you into the bargain"
The other man had not the least objection ; and accordingly they exchanged , and our peasant became proprietor of the goose.
By this time he was very near the town.
The crowd on the high-road became greater and greater ; there was quite a crush of men and cattle.
This fowl had short tail-feathers , and winked with both its eyes , and looked very cunning.
`` Cluck , cluck !"
said the fowl.
On my word , I should like to have that fowl.
A fowl can always find a grain or two , and can almost keep itself.
I think it would be a good exchange if I could get that for my goose.
`` Shall we exchange ?"
he asked the toll-taker.
`` Exchange !"
repeated the man ; `` well , that would not be a bad thing"
And so they exchanged ; the toll-taker at the barrier kept the goose , and the peasant carried away the fowl.
Now , he had done a good deal of business on his way to the fair , and he was hot and tired.
He wanted something to eat , and a glass of brandy to drink ; and soon he was in front of the inn.
He was just about to step in , when the hostler came out , so they met at the door.
The hostler was carrying a sack.
`` What have you in that sack ?"
asked the peasant.
`` Rotten apples ,"
answered the hostler ; `` a whole sackful of them -- enough to feed the pigs with"
-LRB- Illustration : THE OLD MAN RELATES HIS SUCCESS.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Why , that 's terrible waste ! I should like to take them to my old woman at home.
` It was always property , ' my old woman said ; but here she could see a quantity of property -- a whole sackful.
Yes , I shall be glad to show them to her"
`` What will you give me for the sackful ?"
asked the hostler.
`` What will I give ? I will give my fowl in exchange"
And he gave the fowl accordingly , and received the apples , which he carried into the guest-room.
He leaned the sack carefully by the stove , and then went to the table.
But the stove was hot : he had not thought of that.
Hiss-s-s ! hiss-s-s ! What was that by the stove ? The apples were beginning to roast ! `` What is that ?"
`` Why , do you know -- ,"
said our peasant.
`` Well , your old woman will give it you well when you get home !"
said one of the two Englishmen.
`` There will be a disturbance"
`` What ? -- give me what ?"
said the peasant.
`` She will kiss me , and say , ` What the old man does is always right.
'"
`` Shall we wager ?"
said the Englishman.
`` We 'll wager coined gold by the ton -- a hundred pounds to the hundredweight !"
`` A bushel will be enough ,"
replied the peasant.
`` Done -- taken !"
And the bet was made.
`` Good evening , old woman"
`` Good evening , old man"
`` I 've made the exchange"
`` Yes , you understand what you 're about ,"
said the woman.
And she embraced him , and paid no attention to the stranger guests , nor did she notice the sack.
`` I got a cow in exchange for the horse ,"
said he.
`` Heaven be thanked !"
said she.
`` What glorious milk we shall have , and butter and cheese on the table ! That was a capital exchange !"
`` Yes , but I changed the cow for a sheep"
`` Ah , that 's better still !"
cried the wife.
`` You always think of everything : we have just pasture enough for a sheep.
Ewe 's - milk and cheese , and woollen jackets and stockings ! The cow can not give those , and her hairs will only come off.
How you think of everything !"
`` But I changed away the sheep for a goose"
`` Then this year we shall really have roast goose to eat , my dear old man.
You are always thinking of something to give me pleasure.
How charming that is ! We can let the goose walk about with a string to her leg , and she 'll grow fatter still before we roast her"
`` But I gave away the goose for a fowl ,"
said the man.
`` A fowl ? That was a good exchange !"
replied the woman.
`` Yes , but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shrivelled apples"
`` What ! -- I must positively kiss you for that ,"
exclaimed the wife.
`` My dear , good husband ! Now , I 'll tell you something.
Do you know , you had hardly left me this morning , before I began thinking how I could give you something very nice this evening.
I thought it should be pancakes with savoury herbs.
I had eggs , and bacon too ; but I wanted herbs.
I begged her to lend me a handful of herbs.
` Lend ! ' she answered me ; ` nothing at all grows in our garden , not even a shrivelled apple.
I could not even lend you a shrivelled apple , my dear woman.
' But now _ I _ can lend _ her _ ten , or a whole sackful.
That I 'm very glad of ; that makes me laugh !"
And with that she gave him a sounding kiss.
`` I like that !"
exclaimed both the Englishmen together.
`` Always going down-hill , and always merry ; that 's worth the money"
So they paid a hundredweight of gold to the peasant , who was not scolded , but kissed.
Yes , it always pays , when the wife sees and always asserts that her husband knows best , and that whatever he does is right.
You see , that is my story.
I heard it when I was a child ; and now you have heard it too , and know that `` What the old man does is always right"
There was once a King who had an illness , and no one believed that he would come out of it with his life.
He had three sons who were much distressed about it , and went down into the palace-garden and wept.
There they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their grief.
They told him that their father was so ill that he would most certainly die , for nothing seemed to cure him.
The eldest said , `` I will manage to find it ,"
`` No ,"
said the King , `` the danger of it is too great.
I would rather die"
But he begged so long that the King consented.
The prince thought in his heart , `` If I bring the water , then I shall be best beloved of my father , and shall inherit the kingdom"
`` Silly shrimp ,"
said the prince , very haughtily , `` it is nothing to do with you ,"
and rode on.
But the little dwarf had grown angry , and had wished an evil wish.
The sick King waited long for him , but he came not.
Then the second son said , `` Father , let me go forth to seek the water ,"
and thought to himself , `` If my brother is dead , then the kingdom will fall to me"
said the prince , `` that is nothing to thee ,"
and rode on without giving him another look.
But the dwarf bewitched him , and he , like the other , rode into a ravine , and could neither go forwards nor backwards.
So fare haughty people.
`` Dost thou know , then , where that is to be found ?"
`` No ,"
said the prince.
Then hasten to fetch some of the water of life before the clock strikes twelve , else the door will shut again , and thou wilt be imprisoned"
The prince thanked him , took the wand and the bread , and set out on his way.
When he arrived , everything was as the dwarf had said.
A sword and a loaf of bread were lying there , which he carried away.
So he lay down and fell asleep.
When he awoke , it was striking a quarter to twelve.
He sprang up in a fright , ran to the spring , drew some water in a cup which stood near , and hastened away.
He , however , rejoicing at having obtained the water of life , went homewards , and again passed the dwarf.
`` They are imprisoned between two mountains ,"
said the dwarf.
`` I have condemned them to stay there , because they were so haughty"
The prince then took back his loaf and his sword , and the three brothers rode on.
They then began to seek revenge , and plotted with each other to destroy him.
But scarcely had he drunk a very little of the salt sea-water than he became still worse than before.
He had scarcely tasted it , when he felt his sickness departing , and became strong and healthy as in the days of his youth.
The old King was angry with his youngest son , and thought he had plotted against his life.
So he summoned the court together and had sentence pronounced upon his son , that he should be secretly shot.
The huntsman said , `` I can not tell you , and yet I ought"
Then the prince said , `` Say openly what it is , I will pardon you"
`` Alas !"
said the huntsman , `` I am to shoot you dead , the King has ordered me to do it"
The huntsman said , `` I will willingly do that , indeed I should not have been able to shoot you"
Then they exchanged clothes , and the huntsman returned home ; the prince , however , went further into the forest.
The old King then thought , `` Can my son have been innocent ?"
and said to his people , `` Would that he were still alive , how it grieves me that I have suffered him to be killed !"
`` He still lives ,"
said the huntsman , `` I could not find it in my heart to carry out your command ,"
and told the King how it had happened.
But when he came to the door , the servants told him that he was not the right man , and was to go away again.
When it was over she told him that his father invited him to come to him , and had forgiven him.
So he rode thither , and told him everything ; how his brothers had betrayed him , and how he had nevertheless kept silence.
The old King wished to punish them , but they had put to sea , and never came back as long as they lived"
There were once a man and a woman who had an only child , and lived quite alone in a solitary valley.
As it was spring-time , and the child took pleasure in the many-coloured flowers , she went still further onwards with him into the forest.
Thereupon they gave her something to eat , and showed her a bed where she might sleep with her child.
The woman stayed many years with the robbers , and person_0 grew tall and strong.
His mother told him stories , and taught him to read an old book of tales about knights which she found in the cave.
Then the captain laughed , and gave person_0 such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table.
person_0 got up again , held his tongue , and thought , `` I will wait another year and then try again , perhaps I shall do better then"
At night the robbers came home , drank one jug of wine after another , and their heads began to be heavy.
His mother stood in a corner full of admiration of his bravery and strength.
`` Dear person_0 ,"
answered the mother , `` come , we will go and seek him until we find him"
He stood there and wondered at everything just as if he had not been very wise.
The father was sitting in the doorway.
He wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard that person_0 was his son , for he had long regarded them both as dead.
But person_0 , although he was not twelve years old , was a head taller than his father.
`` God save us !"
cried the father , `` what 's that ? Now thou hast broken our little house to pieces !"
`` Do n't grow any gray hairs about that , dear father ,"
answered person_0 ; `` there , in that sack , is more than is wanting for a new house"
The father and person_0 at once began to build a new house ; to buy cattle and land , and to keep a farm.
person_0 ploughed the fields , and when he followed the plough and pushed it into the ground , the bullocks had scarcely any need to draw.
The next spring , person_0 said , `` Keep all the money and get a walking-stick that weighs a hundred-weight made for me that I may go a-travelling"
When the wished-for stick was ready , he left his father 's house , went forth , and came to a deep , dark forest.
`` Hollo !"
cried person_0 , `` what art thou doing up there ?"
the fellow replied , `` I got some faggots together yesterday and am twisting a rope for them"
`` That is what I like ,"
thought person_0 , `` he has some strength ,"
and he called to him , `` Leave that alone , and come with me"
The fellow came down , and he was taller by a whole head than person_0 , and person_0 was not little.
`` Thy name is now Fir-twister ,"
said person_0 to him.
Thereupon they went further and heard something knocking and hammering with such force that the ground shook at every stroke.
Shortly afterwards they came to a mighty rock , before which a giant was standing and striking great pieces of it away with his fist.
`` Oh , indeed ,"
thought person_0 , `` I can make use of this one also ;"
and said to him , `` Leave thy house-building alone , and go with me ; thou shalt be called Rock-splitter"
The man consented , and they all three roamed through the forest , and wherever they went the wild beasts were terrified , and ran away from them.
In the evening they came to an old deserted castle , went up into it , and laid themselves down in the hall to sleep.
The next morning person_0 went into the garden.
It had run quite wild , and was full of thorns and bushes.
He took it on his shoulders and carried it in , and they put it on a spit , roasted it , and enjoyed themselves.
Fir-twister stayed at home the first , and person_0 and Rock-splitter went out hunting.
When Fir-twister was busy cooking , a little shrivelled-up old mannikin came to him in the castle , and asked for some meat.
`` Be off , sly hypocrite ,"
he answered , `` thou needest no meat"
and the mere thought of that gave him pleasure already.
Then person_0 thought , `` He is a poor wretch , I will give him some of my share , that the others may not run short ,"
and handed him a bit.
But the dwarf begged again for the third time.
`` Thou art shameless !"
said person_0 , and gave him none.
person_0 , without exerting himself much , gave him a couple of blows which made him jump down the castle steps.
person_0 was about to run after him , but fell right over him , for he was so tall.
When he rose up again , the dwarf had got the start of him.
person_0 hurried after him as far as the forest , and saw him slip into a hole in the rock.
person_0 now went home , but he had marked the spot.
When the two others came back , they were surprised that person_0 was so well.
He told them what had happened , and then they no longer concealed how it had fared with them.
and gave him such a blow with his club that he fell down dead.
Immediately the chains fell from the maiden , and person_0 was enraptured with her beauty.
The count had , however , set the dwarf as a watchman , and he had made her bear misery and vexation enough.
`` It is indeed sad ,"
said he to himself , `` that I have to waste away down here ,"
They obeyed instantly , and it was just as if he had flown up himself.
When , however , he was above again , he found no one in sight.
Fir-twister and Rock-splitter had hurried away , and had taken the beautiful maiden with them.
But person_0 turned the ring , and the spirits of the air came and told him that the two were on the sea.
Hard by a great forest dwelt a wood-cutter with his wife , who had an only child , a little girl three years old.
They were so poor , however , that they no longer had daily bread , and did not know how to get food for her.
Thou art poor and needy , bring thy child to me , I will take her with me and be her mother , and care for her"
The wood-cutter obeyed , brought his child , and gave her to the Virgin Mary , who took her up to heaven with her.
Beware of opening it , or thou wilt bring misery on thyself"
The girl promised to be obedient , and when the Virgin Mary was gone , she began to examine the dwellings of the kingdom of heaven.
Each day she opened one of them , until she had made the round of the twelve.
`` Oh no ,"
said the little angels , `` that would be a sin.
The Virgin Mary has forbidden it , and it might easily cause thy unhappiness"
Then she was silent , but the desire in her heart was not stilled , but gnawed there and tormented her , and let her have no rest.
And once when the angels had all gone out , she thought , `` Now I am quite alone , and I could peep in.
If I do it , no one will ever know"
Then the door sprang open , and she saw there the Trinity sitting in fire and splendor.
Immediately a great fear fell on her.
She shut the door violently , and ran away.
It was not long before the Virgin Mary came back from her journey.
She called the girl before her , and asked to have the keys of heaven back.
When the maiden gave her the bunch , the Virgin looked into her eyes and said , `` Hast thou not opened the thirteenth door also ?"
`` No ,"
she replied.
Then she said once again , `` Art thou certain that thou hast not done it ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the girl , for the second time.
`` No ,"
said the girl for the third time.
Then said the Virgin Mary , `` Thou hast not obeyed me , and besides that thou hast lied , thou art no longer worthy to be in heaven"
Then the girl fell into a deep sleep , and when she awoke she lay on the earth below , and in the midst of a wilderness.
She wanted to cry out , but she could bring forth no sound.
In the desert , in which she was imprisoned , there stood an old hollow tree , and this had to be her dwelling-place.
Into this she crept when night came , and here she slept.
Roots and wild berries were her only food , and for these she sought as far as she could go.
In the autumn she picked up the fallen nuts and leaves , and carried them into the hole.
Before long her clothes were all torn , and one bit of them after another fell off her.
Thus she sat year after year , and felt the pain and the misery of the world.
But she gave no answer , for she could not open her mouth.
The King continued , `` Wilt thou go with me to my castle ?"
Then she just nodded her head a little.
After a year or so had passed , the Queen brought a son into the world.
Then the queen was permitted to answer , but she remained hard , and said , `` No , I did not open the forbidden door ;"
and the Virgin Mary took the new-born child from her arms , and vanished with it.
She heard all this and could say nothing to the contrary , but the King would not believe it , for he loved her so much.
Then the Queen again said , `` No , I did not open the forbidden door ;"
and the Virgin took the child out of her arms , and away with her to heaven.
But for the third time the Queen answered , `` No , I did not open the forbidden door"
Then the Virgin let her sink down to earth once more , and took from her likewise her third child.
Next morning , when the loss was reported abroad , all the people cried loudly , `` The Queen is a man-eater.
She must be judged ,"
and the King was no longer able to restrain his councillors.
Thereupon a trial was held , and as she could not answer , and defend herself , she was condemned to be burnt alive.
Then her voice came back to her , and she cried out loudly , `` Yes , Mary , I did it ;"
She spoke kindly to her , and said , `` He who repents his sin and acknowledges it , is forgiven"
Then she gave her the three children , untied her tongue , and granted her happiness for her whole life"
THERE was once on a time a King who had a great forest near his palace , full of all kinds of wild animals.
One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe , but he did not come back.
`` Perhaps some accident has befallen him ,"
said the King , and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him , but they too stayed away.
But of these also , none came home again , and of the pack of hounds which they had taken with them , none were seen more.
The huntsman replied , `` Lord , I will venture it at my own risk , of fear I know nothing"
The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest.
They bound him with cords , and led him away to the castle.
And from this time forth every one could again go into the forest with safety.
The boy ran thither and said , `` Give me my ball out"
`` Not till thou hast opened the door for me ,"
answered the man.
`` No ,"
said the boy , `` I will not do that ; the King has forbidden it ,"
and ran away.
The next day he again went and asked for his ball ; the wild man said , `` Open my door ,"
but the boy would not.
Then the wild man said , `` It lies under thy mother 's pillow , thou canst get it there"
The boy , who wanted to have his ball back , cast all thought to the winds , and brought the key.
The door opened with difficulty , and the boy pinched his fingers.
When it was open the wild man stepped out , gave him the golden ball , and hurried away.
The wild man turned back , took him up , set him on his shoulder , and went with hasty steps into the forest.
She called the boy , but no one answered.
The King sent out people to seek for him in the fields , but they did not find him.
Then he could easily guess what had happened , and much grief reigned in the royal court.
If thou dost all I bid thee , thou shalt fare well.
Of treasure and gold have I enough , and more than anyone in the world"
I will come every evening to see if thou hast obeyed my order"
As he was thus sitting , his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water.
In the evening Iron John came back , looked at the boy , and said , `` What has happened to the well ?"
`` Nothing , nothing ,"
he answered , and held his finger behind his back , that the man might not see it.
By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it.
His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head , and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well.
He took it quickly out , but it was already quite gilded.
Iron John came , and already knew what had happened.
`` Thou hast let a hair fall into the well ,"
said he.
On the third day , the boy sat by the well , and did not stir his finger , however much it hurt him.
But the time was long to him , and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water.
He raised himself up quickly , but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun.
When he came he already knew everything , and said , `` Take the handkerchief off"
Then the golden hair streamed forth , and let the boy excuse himself as he might , it was of no use.
`` Thou hast not stood the trial , and canst stay here no longer.
Go forth into the world , there thou wilt learn what poverty is.
My power is great , greater than thou thinkest , and I have gold and silver in abundance"
Then the King 's son left the forest , and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city.
There he looked for work , but could find none , and he had learned nothing by which he could help himself.
At length he went to the palace , and asked if they would take him in.
The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him , but they liked him , and told him to stay.
At length the cook took him into his service , and said he might carry wood and water , and rake the cinders together.
He answered , `` Ah , Lord , I can not ; I have a bad sore place on my head"
The cook , however , had pity on him , and exchanged him for the gardener 's boy.
And now the boy had to plant and water the garden , hoe and dig , and bear the wind and bad weather.
Then she saw the boy , and cried to him , `` Boy , bring me a wreath of flowers"
He put his cap on with all haste , and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together.
`` Oh , no ,"
replied the boy , `` the wild ones have more scent , and will please her better"
He again said , `` I may not , I have a sore head"
He wanted to run out , but she held him by the arm , and gave him a handful of ducats.
With these he departed , but he cared nothing for the gold pieces.
He took them to the gardener , and said , `` I present them to thy children , they can play with them"
She again gave him a handful of ducats , but he would not keep them , and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children.
On the third day things went just the same ; she could not get his cap away from him , and he would not have her money.
Not long afterwards , the country was overrun by war.
Then said the gardener 's boy , `` I am grown up , and will go to the wars also , only give me a horse"
The others laughed , and said , `` Seek one for thyself when we are gone , we will leave one behind us in the stable for thee"
When he came to the outskirts , he called `` Iron John ,"
three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees.
Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately , and said , `` What dost thou desire ?"
`` I want a strong steed , for I am going to the wars"
`` That thou shalt have , and still more than thou askest for"
The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy , mounted the other , and rode at the head of the soldiers.
Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers , broke like a hurricane over the enemy , and beat down all who opposed him.
They began to fly , but the youth pursued , and never stopped , until there was not a single man left.
Instead , however , of returning to the King , he conducted his troop by bye-ways back to the forest , and called forth Iron John.
`` What dost thou desire ?"
asked the wild man.
`` Take back thy horse and thy troops , and give me my three-legged horse again"
All that he asked was done , and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse.
When the King returned to his palace , his daughter went to meet him , and wished him joy of his victory.
`` I am not the one who carried away the victory ,"
said he , `` but a stranger knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers"
They asked , too , `` Under what hedge hast thou been lying sleeping all the time ?"
He , however , said , `` I did the best of all , and it would have gone badly without me"
And then he was still more ridiculed"
The King said to his daughter , `` I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days , and thou shalt throw a golden apple.
Perhaps the unknown will come to it"
When the feast was announced , the youth went out to the forest , and called Iron John.
`` What dost thou desire ?"
asked he.
`` That I may catch the King 's daughter 's golden apple"
`` It is as safe as if thou hadst it already ,"
said Iron John.
`` Thou shalt likewise have a suit of red armor for the occasion , and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse"
When the day came , the youth galloped to the spot , took his place amongst the knights , and was recognized by no one.
On the second day Iron John equipped him as a white knight , and gave him a white horse.
Again he was the only one who caught the apple , and he did not linger an instant , but galloped off with it.
The King grew angry , and said , `` That is not allowed ; he must appear before me and tell his name"
On the third day , he received from Iron John a suit of black armor and a black horse , and again he caught the apple.
They rode back and announced this to the King.
The following day the King 's daughter asked the gardener about his boy.
The King had him summoned into his presence , and he came and again had his little cap on his head.
`` Art thou the knight who came every day to the festival , always in different colors , and who caught the three golden apples ?"
asked the King.
`` Yes ,"
answered he , `` and here the apples are ,"
and he took them out of his pocket , and returned them to the King.
`` If you desire further proof , you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me.
But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies"
`` If thou canst perform such deeds as that , thou art no gardener 's boy ; tell me , who is thy father ?"
`` My father is a mighty King , and gold have I in plenty as great as I require"
`` I well see ,"
said the King , `` that I owe thanks to thee ; can I do anything to please thee ?"
`` Yes ,"
answered he , `` that indeed you can.
Give me your daughter to wife"
and then she went and kissed him.
He had , however , some courage in him , and said to his father , `` Father , I must and will go out into the world"
`` That 's right , my son ,"
It was , however , just dished up , and the dish stood on the hearth.
Then he said , `` Mother , what is there to eat to-day ?"
`` See for thyself ,"
said his mother.
He rode about in the air on the steam for a while , until at length he sank down to the ground again.
`` Mistress , if you give us no better food ,"
Potato-King.
'"
`` What wouldst thou have forsooth , grasshopper ?"
`` Ho , ho , lady mistress ,"
cried he , and thrust his head out , and when she began to strike him he leapt down into the drawer.
At last , however , she caught him and drove him out of the house.
When they saw the little tailor , they thought , `` A little fellow like that can creep through a key-hole and serve as picklock to us"
`` Hollo ,"
cried one of them , `` thou giant Goliath , wilt thou go to the treasure-chamber with us ? Thou canst slip thyself in and throw out the money"
person_0 reflected a while , and at length he said , `` yes ,"
and went with them to the treasure-chamber.
Then he looked at the doors above and below , to see if there was any crack in them.
It was not long before he espied one which was broad enough to let him in.
`` Let the poor creature alone ,"
said the other ; `` it has done thee no harm"
Then he went away again , and said to the sentries , `` Be on the watch , some one is after the money"
When therefore person_0 recommenced his labors , they heard the money moving , and a sound of klink , klink , klink.
And thus he made fools of them , and drove them so long round about the treasure-chamber that they were weary and went away.
The robbers paid him great compliments.
`` Thou art a valiant hero ,"
said they ; `` wilt thou be our captain ?"
person_0 , however , declined , and said he wanted to see the world first.
They now divided the booty , but the little tailor only asked for a kreuzer because he could not carry more.
Then he once more buckled on his sword , bade the robbers goodbye , and took to the road.
Then said they , `` Wait , and we will pay thee off !"
and arranged with each other to play him a trick.
Now amongst them there was a great black one , who swallowed him down without hurting him.
Down below , however , it pleased him ill , for it was quite dark , neither was any candle burning.
When the cow was being milked he cried , `` Strip , strap , strull , Will the pail soon be full ?"
But the noise of the milking prevented his being understood.
After this the master of the house came into the cow-byre and said , `` That cow shall be killed to-morrow"
Then person_0 was so alarmed that he cried out in a clear voice , `` Let me out first , for I am shut up inside her"
The master heard that quite well , but did not know from whence the voice came.
`` Where art thou ?"
asked he.
`` In the black one ,"
answered person_0 , but the master did not understand what that meant , and went out.
Next morning the cow was killed.
Happily person_0 did not meet with one blow at the cutting up and chopping ; he got among the sausage-meat.
No one heard this because of the noise of the chopping-knife.
But still he could not get away , there was nothing for it but to let himself be thrust into a black-pudding with the bits of bacon.
At length in winter he was taken down again , as the black-pudding had to be set before a guest.
But his liberty did not last long.
In the open country he met with a fox who snapped him up in a fit of absence.
`` Hollo , Mr.
Fox ,"
cried the little tailor , `` it is I who am sticking in your throat , set me at liberty again"
`` Thou art right ,"
answered the fox.
`` Thou art next to nothing for me , but if thou wilt promise me the fowls in thy father 's yard I will let thee go"
`` With all my heart ,"
replied person_0.
`` Thou shalt have all the cocks and hens , that I promise thee"
Then the fox let him go again , and himself carried him home.
When the father once more saw his dear son , he willingly gave the fox all the fowls which he had.
`` For this I likewise bring thee a handsome bit of money ,"
said person_0 , and gave his father the kreuzer which he earned on his travels.
`` But why did the fox get the poor chickens to eat ?"
`` Oh , you goose , your father would surely love his child far more than the fowls in the yard !"
At that moment a very big fish jumped about in the bottom of the basket.
`` Is it a he or a she ?"
inquired the queen.
`` I wish to purchase a she fish"
On hearing this the fish laughed aloud.
`` It 's a he ,"
replied the fisherwoman , and proceeded on her rounds.
`` Are you indisposed ?"
he said.
`` No ; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behavior of a fish.
A woman brought me one to-day , and on my inquiring whether it was a male or female , the fish laughed most rudely"
`` A fish laugh ! Impossible ! You must be dreaming"
`` I am not a fool.
I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes and have heard with my own ears"
`` Passing strange ! Be it so.
I will inquire concerning it"
The vizier promised to do his best , though he felt almost certain of failure.
For five months he labored indefatigably to find a reason for the laughter of the fish.
He sought everywhere and from every one.
The wise and learned , and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner of trickery , were consulted.
Amongst other things , he advised his son to travel for a time , until the king 's anger should have somewhat cooled.
The young fellow , who was both clever and handsome , started off whithersoever Kismat might lead him.
He had been gone some days , when he fell in with an old farmer , who also was on a journey to a certain village.
Finding the old man very pleasant , he asked him if he might accompany him , professing to be on a visit to the same place.
The old farmer agreed , and they walked along together.
The day was hot , and the way was long and weary.
`` Do n't you think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes gave one another a lift ?"
said the youth.
`` What a fool the man is !"
thought the old farmer.
`` Is this eaten or not ?"
said the young man.
Not understanding his meaning , the old man replied , `` I do n't know"
They walked about the bazar and went to the mosque , but nobody saluted them or invited them to come in and rest.
`` What a large cemetery !"
exclaimed the young man.
`` What does the man mean ,"
thought the old farmer , `` calling this largely populated city a cemetery ?"
They beckoned to the two travellers and gave them as much as they would.
`` What a splendid city this is !"
said the young man.
`` Now , the man must surely be demented !"
thought the old farmer.
However , he kept his thoughts to himself.
Presently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge of the cemetery.
`` Well ! I never did see such a perfect fool , both in word and in deed ,"
said the old man to himself.
`` Thank you very much ,"
the young man replied ; `` but let me first inquire , if you please , whether the beam of your house is strong"
The old farmer left him in despair , and entered his house laughing.
`` There is a man in yonder field ,"
he said , after returning their greetings.
But the fellow is such a fool that I can not make anything out of him.
He wants to know if the beam of this house is all right.
The man must be mad !"
and saying this , he burst into a fit of laughter.
`` Father ,"
He only wishes to know if you can afford to entertain him"
`` Oh ! of course ,"
replied the farmer.
`` I see.
Well perhaps you can help me to solve some of his other mysteries.
While we were walking together he asked whether he should carry me or I should carry him , as he thought that would be a pleasanter mode of proceeding"
`` Most assuredly ,"
said the girl.
`` He meant that one of you should tell a story to beguile the time"
`` Oh yes.
Well , we were passing through a corn-field , when he asked me whether it was eaten or not"
`` I see ,"
said the farmer.
`` True , true !"
said the astonished farmer.
`` Then , just now , when we were crossing the stream , he waded through it without taking off his shoes and paijamas"
`` I admire his wisdom ,"
replied the girl.
`` I have often thought how stupid people were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and over those sharp stones with bare feet.
The slightest stumble and they would fall , and be wetted from head to foot.
This friend of yours is a most wise man.
I should like to see him and speak to him"
`` Very well ,"
said the farmer ; `` I will go and find him , and bring him in"
`` Tell him , father , that our beams are strong enough , and then he will come in.
I 'll send on ahead a present to the man , to show him that we can afford to have him for our guest"
His father foolishly complied.
Presently he saw the young man , and gave him the rest of the present and the message.
`` Give your mistress my salam ,"
After a little while the young man appeared with the old farmer.
`` The laughing of the fish ,"
`` Joy , joy !"
exclaimed the vizier 's son.
`` There is yet time for me to return and save my father from an ignominious and unjust death , and the king from danger"
The following day he hastened back to his own country , taking with him the farmer 's daughter.
Immediately on arrival he ran to the palace and informed his father of what he had heard.
`` Never !"
said the king.
`` But it must be so , Your Majesty ,"
We 'll soon find out whether there is any man there"
The king had the pit dug , and commanded all the maids belonging to the palace to try to jump it.
All of them tried , but only one succeeded.
That one was found to be a man ! ! Thus was the queen satisfied , and the faithful old vizier saved.
Afterwards , as soon as could be , the vizier 's son married the old farmer 's daughter ; and a most happy marriage it was"
It is prophesied , too , that in his fourteenth year he will have the person_0 's daughter for his wife"
they at last consented , and gave him the child.
The box , however , did not sink , but floated like a boat , and not a drop of water made its way into it.
They took great care of the foundling , and he grew up in all goodness.
It happened that once in a storm , the person_0 went into the mill , and he asked the mill-folk if the tall youth was their son.
`` No ,"
answered they , `` he 's a foundling.
Fourteen years ago he floated down to the mill-dam in a box , and the mill-boy pulled him out of the water"
`` Just as the person_0 commands ,"
answered they , and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness.
The boy set out with this letter ; but he lost his way , and in the evening came to a large forest.
In the darkness he saw a small light ; he went towards it and reached a cottage.
When he went in , an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone.
She started when she saw the boy , and said , `` Whence do you come , and whither are you going ?"
`` I come from the mill ,"
`` You poor boy ,"
said the woman , `` you have come into a den of thieves , and when they come home they will kill you"
`` Let them come ,"
said the boy , `` I am not afraid ; but I am so tired that I can not go any farther :"
and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.
Soon afterwards the robbers came , and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there ? `` Ah ,"
The robbers opened the letter and read it , and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death.
After some time the person_0 returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled , and the luck-child married to his daughter.
`` How has that come to pass ?"
said he ; `` I gave quite another order in my letter"
So the Queen gave him the letter , and said that he might see for himself what was written in it.
The person_0 read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other.
He asked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him , and why he had brought another instead of it.
`` I know nothing about it ,"
answered he ; `` it must have been changed in the night , when I slept in the forest"
In this way the person_0 hoped to be rid of him for ever.
But the luck-child answered , `` I will fetch the golden hairs , I am not afraid of the Devil ;"
thereupon he took leave of them and began his journey.
The road led him to a large town , where the watchman by the gates asked him what his trade was , and what he knew.
`` I know everything ,"
answered the luck-child.
`` Then you can do us a favor ,"
`` That you shall know ,"
answered he ; `` only wait until I come back"
Then he went farther and came to another town , and there also the gatekeeper asked him what was his trade , and what he knew.
`` I know everything ,"
answered he.
`` You shall know that ,"
answered he ; `` only wait until I come back"
Then he went on and came to a wide river over which he must go.
The ferryman asked him what his trade was , and what he knew.
`` I know everything ,"
answered he.
`` Then you can do me a favor ,"
said the ferryman , `` and tell me why I must always be rowing backwards and forwards , and am never set free ?"
`` You shall know that ,"
answered he ; `` only wait until I come back"
When he had crossed the water he found the entrance to Hell.
It was black and sooty within , and the Devil was not at home , but his grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair.
`` What do you want ?"
said she to him , but she did not look so very wicked.
`` I should like to have three golden hairs from the devil 's head ,"
answered he , `` else I can not keep my wife"
`` That is a good deal to ask for ,"
She changed him into an ant and said , `` Creep into the folds of my dress , you will be safe there"
`` Yes ,"
`` Those are difficult questions ,"
answered she , `` but only be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out the three golden hairs"
As the evening came on , the devil returned home.
No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure.
`` I smell man 's flesh ,"
said he ; `` all is not right here"
Then he pried into every corner , and searched , but could not find anything.
His grandmother scolded him.
`` It has just been swept ,"
said she , `` and everything put in order , and now you are upsetting it again ; you have always got man 's flesh in your nose.
Sit down and eat your supper"
Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair , pulled it out , and laid it down near her.
`` Oh !"
cried the devil , `` what are you doing ?"
`` I have had a bad dream ,"
answered the grandmother , `` so I seized hold of your hair"
`` What did you dream then ?"
said the devil.
`` Oh , ho ! if they did but know it ,"
answered the devil ; `` there is a toad sitting under a stone in the well ; if they killed it , the wine would flow again"
He went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook.
Then she pulled the second hair out.
`` Ha ! what are you doing ?"
cried the devil angrily.
`` Do not take it ill ,"
said she , `` I did it in a dream"
`` What have you dreamt this time ?"
asked he.
`` I dreamt that in a certain kingdom there stood an apple-tree which had once borne golden apples , but now would not even bear leaves.
What , think you , was the reason ?"
`` Oh ! if they did but know ,"
answered the devil.
But leave me alone with your dreams : if you disturb me in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear"
The grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored.
Then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out.
`` What was the dream , then ?"
asked he , and was quite curious.
`` I dreamt of a ferry-man who complained that he must always ferry from one side to the other , and was never released.
What is the cause of it ?"
`` Ah ! the fool ,"
`` There are the three golden hairs for you ,"
said she.
`` What the Devil said to your three questions , I suppose you heard ?"
`` Yes ,"
answered he , `` I heard , and will take care to remember"
`` You have what you want ,"
said she , `` and now you can go your way"
He thanked the old woman for helping him in his need , and left hell well content that everything had turned out so fortunately.
When he came to the ferry-man he was expected to give the promised answer.
`` Ferry me across first ,"
said the luck-child , `` and then I will tell you how you can be set free ,"
He went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful tree , and there too the watchman wanted an answer.
Then the watchman thanked him , and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold , which followed him.
At last he came to the town whose well was dry.
The watchman thanked him , and also gave him two asses laden with gold.
But tell me , dear son-in-law , where did all that gold come from ? this is tremendous wealth !"
`` I was rowed across a river ,"
answered he , `` and got it there ; it lies on the shore instead of sand"
`` Can I too fetch some of it ?"
said the person_0 ; and he was quite eager about it.
`` As much as you like ,"
answered he.
`` There is a ferry-man on the river ; let him ferry you over , and you can fill your sacks on the other side"
The greedy person_0 set out in all haste , and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferry-man to put him across.
The ferry-man came and bade him get in , and when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his hand and sprang out.
But from this time forth the person_0 had to ferry , as a punishment for his sins.
Perhaps he is ferrying still ? If he is , it is because no one has taken the oar from him"
At length , completely tired , two straws he sought Of diff ` rent lengths , and to the parties brought.
These in his hand he held : -- the plaintiff drew -LRB- So fate decreed -RRB- the shortest of the two.
On this the other homeward took his way , To boast how nicely he had gained the day.
PAINTER in Paphos and Cythera famed Depict , I pray , the absent Iris ' face.
Thou hast not seen the lovely nymph I 've named ; The better for thy peace.
-- Then will I trace For thy instruction her transcendent grace.
Begin with lily white and blushing rose , Take then the Loves and Graces.
Thou at Cythera couldst , at Paphos too , Of the same Iris Venus form anew"
A STURGEON , once , a glutton famed was led To have for supper -- all , except the head.
With wond ` rous glee he feasted on the fish ; And quickly swallowed down the royal dish.
O'ercharged , howe'er , his stomach soon gave way ; And doctors were required without delay.
THE danger imminent , his friends desired He 'd settle ev ` ry thing affairs required.
At last the mother was once so overcome with anger and impatience , that she beat her , on which the girl began to weep loudly.
She insists on spinning for ever and ever , and I am poor , and can not procure the flax"
Let me have your daughter with me in the palace.
I have flax enough , and there she shall spin as much as she likes"
The mother was heartily satisfied with this , and the Queen took the girl with her.
`` Now spin me this flax ,"
said she , `` and when thou hast done it , thou shalt have my eldest son for a husband , even if thou art poor.
I care not for that , thy indefatigable industry is dowry enough"
When therefore she was alone , she began to weep , and sat thus for three days without moving a finger.
The queen was satisfied with this , but said when she was going away , `` To-morrow thou must begin to work"
When the girl was alone again , she did not know what to do , and in her distress went to the window.
`` With all my heart ,"
she replied , `` do but come in and begin the work at once"
Then she let in the three strange women , and cleared a place in the first room , where they seated themselves and began their spinning.
When the first room was empty she went to the second , and at last to the third , and that too was quickly cleared.
Then the three women took leave and said to the girl , `` Do not forget what thou hast promised us , -- it will make thy fortune"
`` I have three aunts ,"
The Queen and the bridegroom said , `` Why should we not allow that ?"
Therefore when the feast began , the three women entered in strange apparel , and the bride said , `` Welcome , dear aunts"
`` Ah ,"
said the bridegroom , `` how comest thou by these odious friends ?"
Thereupon he went to the one with the broad flat foot , and said , `` How do you come by such a broad foot ?"
`` By treading ,"
she answered , `` by treading"
Then the bridegroom went to the second , and said , `` How do you come by your falling lip ?"
`` By licking ,"
she answered , `` by licking"
Then he asked the third , `` How do you come by your broad thumb ?"
`` By twisting the thread ,"
she answered , `` by twisting the thread"
On this the King 's son was alarmed and said , `` Neither now nor ever shall my beautiful bride touch a spinning-wheel"
And thus she got rid of the hateful flax-spinning"
And when harvest time came , the apples on this tree were all as red as blood.
When mid-day came , the King wished to call them to come to dinner , but they were nowhere to be found.
He sought them everywhere in the palace and garden , but could not find them.
Then he was much troubled , and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife.
Next day , the second stayed at home , and he fared no better.
When the two others returned in the evening , the eldest said , `` Well , how have you got on ?"
`` Oh , very badly ,"
On the third day , the youngest stayed at home , and again the little mannikin came and begged for a piece of bread.
Then he showed him a deep well , but there was no water in it.
The two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the King 's daughters , but they did not want to have any trouble or danger.
Hans was therefore to take a large basket , and he must seat himself in it with his hanger and a bell , and be let down.
And having said all this , the elf vanished.
When it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got on , and he said , `` pretty well so far ,"
Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow.
Then he said , `` If I ring , you must draw me up again immediately"
When he had gone down for a short distance , he rang , and they at once drew him up again.
Then he took his hanger and hewed at them , and the nine fell off.
And they all rejoiced , and embraced him and kissed him without stopping.
He looked at the dragons , heads likewise and said , `` You too can not help me now"
He walked backwards and forwards for such a long time that he made the surface of the ground quite smooth.
On this she began to cry , and cried louder and louder , and could not be comforted.
She looked round to the side from whence the voice came , and saw a frog stretching forth its thick , ugly head from the water.
`` Ah ! old water-splasher , is it thou ?"
said she ; `` I am weeping for my golden ball , which has fallen into the well"
`` Be quiet , and do not weep ,"
answered the frog , `` I can help thee , but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again ?"
`` Whatever thou wilt have , dear frog ,"
said she -- `` My clothes , my pearls and jewels , and even the golden crown which I am wearing"
`` Oh yes ,"
said she , `` I promise thee all thou wishest , if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again"
The person_0 's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more , and picked it up , and ran away with it.
`` Wait , wait ,"
said the frog.
`` Take me with thee.
I ca n't run as thou canst"
She ran to see who was outside , but when she opened the door , there sat the frog in front of it.
Then she slammed the door to , in great haste , sat down to dinner again , and was quite frightened.
`` Ah , no ,"
replied she.
`` It is no giant but a disgusting frog"
`` What does a frog want with thee ?"
`` Ah , dear father , yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well , playing , my golden ball fell into the water.
Then said the person_0 , `` That which thou hast promised must thou perform.
Go and let him in"
She went and opened the door , and the frog hopped in and followed her , step by step , to her chair.
There he sat and cried , `` Lift me up beside thee"
She delayed , until at last the person_0 commanded her to do it.
She did this , but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.
The frog enjoyed what he ate , but almost every mouthful she took choked her.
But the person_0 grew angry and said , `` He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee"
So she took hold of the frog with two fingers , carried him upstairs , and put him in a corner.
Then she was terribly angry , and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall.
`` Now , thou wilt be quiet , odious frog ,"
said she.
But when he fell down he was no frog but a person_0 's son with beautiful kind eyes.
He by her father 's will was now her dear companion and husband.
The carriage was to conduct the young person_0 into his person_0dom.
Faithful Henry helped them both in , and placed himself behind again , and was full of joy because of this deliverance.
And when they had driven a part of the way the person_0 's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken.
So he turned round and cried , `` Henry , the carriage is breaking"
`` No , master , it is not the carriage.
It is a band from my heart , which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well"
There was once a poor peasant who had no land , but only a small house , and one daughter.
Then said the daughter , `` We ought to ask our lord the King for a bit of newly-cleared land"
When they had dug nearly the whole of the field , they found in the earth a mortar made of pure gold.
`` Listen ,"
The King took the mortar , and asked if he had found nothing besides that ? `` No ,"
answered the countryman.
Then the King said that he must now bring him the pestle.
and would neither eat nor drink.
and what it was that his daughter had said.
`` She told me that I ought not to take the mortar to you , for I should have to produce the pestle as well"
`` If you have a daughter who is as wise as that , let her come here"
She at once said yes , she would guess it.
And when she arrived in that fashion , the King said she had guessed the riddle and fulfilled all the conditions.
Then he ordered her father to be released from the prison , took her to wife , and gave into her care all the royal possessions.
Then the other went away , and wept and lamented over his foal.
Said she , `` Yes , I will tell you what to do , if thou wilt promise me not to betray me.
and then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by the King.
The next day , therefore , the peasant stood there , and fished on dry ground.
The peasant , however , would not do so , and said always , God forbid he should ! the idea was his own.
She said , `` Yes , my dear husband , if you command this , I will do it ,"
and she embraced him and kissed him , and said she would take leave of him.
He called his attendants , but none of them were there.
Tears rose to the King 's eyes and he said , `` Dear wife , thou shalt be mine and I will be thine ,"
and he took her back with him to the royal palace and was married again to her , and at the present time they are very likely still living"
`` That is the King of birds ,"
said the wolf , `` before whom we must bow down"
It was , however , in reality the willow-wren -LRB- Zaunk nig -RRB-.
`` If that 's the case ,"
said the bear , `` I should very much like to see his royal palace ; come , take me thither"
`` That is not done quite as you seem to think ,"
said the wolf ; `` you must wait until the Queen comes"
Soon afterwards , the Queen arrived with some food in her beak , and the lord King came too , and they began to feed their young ones.
So they observed the hole in which was the nest , and trotted away.
The King and Queen had just flown out , so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying in it.
`` Is that the royal palace ?"
cried the bear ; `` it is a wretched palace , and you are not King 's children , you are disreputable children !"
The bear and the wolf grew uneasy , and turned back and went into their holes.
Then the old King said , `` Be easy , he shall be punished ,"
When the time came for the war to begin , the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy 's commander-in-chief.
`` Good ,"
said the fox , `` but what signal shall we agree upon ?"
No one knew that , so the fox said , `` I have a fine long bushy tail , which almost looks like a plume of red feathers.
When the gnat had heard that , she flew away again , and revealed everything , with the greatest minuteness , to the willow-wren.
When day broke , and the battle was to begin , all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled.
But the willow-wren sent down the hornet , with orders to get beneath the fox 's tail , and sting with all his might.
So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear , and begged their pardon.
And now at last the young wrens were satisfied , and sat down together and ate and drank , and made merry till quite late into the night"
SELF-TORMENTS solely parson John obtained ; By seeing her that o ` er his senses reigned.
A pleasant stratagem he now contrived , From which , he hoped , success might be derived.
THE husband promised he would hold his tongue ; And John disliked deferring matters long.
THE husband , while the holy pastor spoke , Appeared to grumble and his stars invoke.
No mare , replied the husband , I desire ; An ass for me is all that I require"
If any belle recede , and shun the sight , Dissimulation she supposes right.
To this I answer : female ears are chaste , Though roguish are their eyes , as well as taste.
With scenes like these will Cupid oft surprise , And frantick passion sparkle in his eyes.
The first attempt had clearly bad success , And fair Theresa suffered you may guess.
But now-a-days , in practice , ` tis confessed , These shopkeepers are knowing as the best.
If you a goddess love , advance she 'll make ; Our belle the same advantages would take.
For one that LOVE lays hold of by the soul , A thousand by the eyes receive control.
To this he nothing offered in reply , Though oft his throbbing bosom heaved a sigh.
THE lad most gratefully his thanks returned ; His breast with ev ` ry soft emotion burned.
Her lover , to secure the promised bliss , An hour 's indulgence gained to take a kiss.
A bow ` r within a garden was the spot , Which , for their private meeting , they had got.
A confidant had been employed around , To watch if any one were lurking found.
I scarcely ought to say what now I speak , But anxiously your happiness I seek.
AWAY the silly lad with ardor flew , And left no time objections to renew.
This said , by disappointment rendered sour , The beauteous bride in anger left the bow ` r.
Soon with the carpet simple Nicaise came , And found that things no longer were the same.
Delays are dangerous , in love or war , And Nicaise is a proof they fortune mar.
.
But opportunity you ca n't discern ; To know its value , -- prithee go and learn"
E ` en better still I find , for naught they do : ` Tis that employment always I pursue.
Just add thereto a little honest love , And I shall be as easy as a glove.
ON t ` other hand an island may be seen , Where all are hated , cursed , and full of spleen.
We know them by the thinness of their face Long sleep is quite excluded from their race.
I now shall go and try to tempt a nun , For I 'm disposed to have a little fun.
PERRETTA at the house remained to greet The lordly devil whom she hoped to cheat.
ONE ` mong these belles had to the altar led , A painter , much esteemed , and who had bread.
What more was requisite ! -- he lived at ease , And by his occupation sought to please.
But since much penetration 's not my boast , I just believe -- what 's requisite at most.
Superior understanding she possessed ; Though fond of laughter , frolick , fun , and jest.
Whichever first a favor might obtain , Should tell his happiness to t ` other swain.
YE FAIR ` tis thus they oft your kindness treat : The pleasure that he wished alone is sweet.
LOVE , is no more ; of t ` other , laid in earth , We 've here no traces scarcely from the birth.
You serve for sport and prey , to giddy youth , Devoid of talents , principles , and truth.
` Tis right they should suppose , still two are found ; Who take their course continually round.
The first that in your pleasure grounds appears ; I 'd have you , on his wings , to use the shears.
` Tis excellent , cried they : things well you frame ; And at the promised hour , the heroes came.
She soon returned , and with her brought the FAIR , Who , gaily singing , entered free from care.
But dreading ghosts , she Simonetta prayed ; To light her down , she was so much afraid.
Mere trifle that ; from talking it might spring ; And other causes , doubtless , we could bring.
ARE we not brothers in adventure , pray ? And such our solemn promises , to-day.
Since one the painter clearly has disgraced , The other equally should be embraced.
HERE ends our tale ; the business is complete ; In soft amours success alone is sweet.
Gross ignorance a thousand has misled , For one that has been hurt by what I 've said.
His comrade , Cymon , with him thither went , To view those ruins , we so oft lament.
Her veil was floating , and her artless dress , A shepherdess seemed clearly to express.
` Tis even said that Cupid lent supplies ; From superstition many things arise.
Two months had passed , and not a person knew Their frequent meetings , pleasure to pursue.
With time our maxims change , and what was then , Though wrong at present , may prevail agen.
THERE was once upon a time a King who had twelve daughters , each one more beautiful than the other.
It was not long before a King 's son presented himself , and offered to undertake the enterprise.
He was well received , and in the evening was led into a room adjoining the princesses ' sleeping-chamber.
On the second and third nights it fell out just the same , and then his head was struck off without mercy.
Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise , but all forfeited their lives.
There he met an old woman , who asked him where he was going.
`` I hardly know myself ,"
answered he , and added in jest , `` I had half a mind to discover where the princesses danced their shoes into holes , and thus become King"
`` That is not so difficult ,"
said the old woman , `` you must not drink the wine which will be brought to you at night , and must pretend to be sound asleep"
He was as well received as the others , and royal garments were put upon him.
Then he lay down and when he had lain a while , he began to snore , as if in the deepest sleep.
The twelve princesses heard that , and laughed , and the eldest said , `` He , too , might as well have saved his life"
`` Thou art a goose , who art always frightened ,"
said the eldest.
The soldier , who had watched everything , tarried no longer , put on his little cloak , and went down last with the youngest.
`` Do n't be so silly !"
said the eldest , `` you have caught it on a nail"
The soldier thought , `` I must carry a token away with me ,"
and broke off a twig from one of them , on which the tree cracked with a loud report.
The youngest cried out again.
`` Something is wrong , did you hear the crack ?"
But the eldest said , `` It is a gun fired for joy , because we have got rid of our prince so quickly"
`` What should cause that ,"
said the youngest , `` but the warm weather ? I feel very warm too"
On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid , brightly-lit castle , from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettle-drums.
On the shore they took leave of their princes , and promised to return the following night.
They took off their beautiful dresses , laid them away , put the worn-out shoes under the bed , and lay down.
Next morning the soldier was resolved not to speak , but to watch the wonderful goings on , and again went with them.
Then everything was done just as it had been done the first time , and each time they danced until their shoes were worn to pieces.
But the third time he took a cup away with him as a token.
When the King put the question , `` Where have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to pieces in the night ?"
he answered , `` In an underground castle with twelve princes ,"
and related how it had come to pass , and brought out the tokens.
Thereupon the King asked which of them he would have to wife ? He answered , `` I am no longer young , so give me the eldest"
Then the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day , and the kingdom was promised him after the King 's death.
But the princes were bewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve"
`` I will take great care ,"
said Little Red-Cap to her mother , and gave her hand on it.
Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was , and was not at all afraid of him.
`` Good-day , Little Red-Cap ,"
said he.
`` Thank you kindly , wolf"
`` Whither away so early , Little Red-Cap ?"
`` To my grandmother 's"
`` What have you got in your apron ?"
`` Cake and wine ; yesterday was baking-day , so poor sick grandmother is to have something good , to make her stronger"
`` Where does your grandmother live , Little Red-Cap ?"
replied Little Red-Cap.
I must act craftily , so as to catch both"
It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time ;"
and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.
Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother 's house and knocked at the door.
`` Who is there ?"
`` Little Red-Cap ,"
replied the wolf.
`` She is bringing cake and wine ; open the door"
`` Lift the latch ,"
called out the grandmother , `` I am too weak , and can not get up"
The wolf lifted the latch , the door flew open , and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother 's bed , and devoured her.
Then he put on her clothes , dressed himself in her cap , laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.
She called out , `` Good morning ,"
but received no answer ; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.
There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face , and looking very strange.
`` Oh ! grandmother ,"
she said , `` what big ears you have !"
`` The better to hear you with , my child ,"
was the reply.
`` But , grandmother , what big eyes you have !"
she said.
`` The better to see you with , my dear"
`` But , grandmother , what large hands you have !"
`` The better to hug you with"
`` Oh ! but , grandmother , what a terrible big mouth you have !"
`` The better to eat you with !"
And scarcely had the wolf said this , than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.
When the wolf had appeased his appetite , he lay down again in the bed , fell asleep and began to snore very loud.
The huntsman was just passing the house , and thought to himself , `` How the old woman is snoring ! I must just see if she wants anything"
So he went into the room , and when he came to the bed , he saw that the wolf was lying in it.
`` Do I find thee here , thou old sinner !"
said he.
`` I have long sought thee !"
and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also , but scarcely able to breathe.
Then all three were delighted.
`` Well ,"
said the grandmother , `` we will shut the door , that he may not come in"
Soon afterwards the wolf knocked , and cried , `` Open the door , grandmother , I am little Red-Cap , and am fetching you some cakes"
But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.
Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full.
But Red-Cap went joyously home , and never did anything to harm any one"
Then the King flew into a passion , and ordered a dark tower to be built , into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter.
There they sat in the darkness , and knew not when day or night began.
The King 's son often went round and round the tower , and called their names , but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls.
She took the bread-knife , and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone , and when she was tired , the waiting-maid took her turn.
When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through , the waiting-maid sprang down first , and then Maid Maleen followed.
But where were they to go ? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom , driven away the King , and slain all the inhabitants.
At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace.
There also they were ordered to go away , but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions.
The son of the King in whose kingdom they were , was , however , the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen.
His father had chosen another bride for him , whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked.
Then said she to Maid Maleen , `` A great piece of luck has befallen thee.
Maid Maleen , however , refused it , and said , `` I wish for no honor which is not suitable for me"
It was in vain , too , that the bride offered her gold.
At last she said angrily , `` If thou dost not obey me , it shall cost thee thy life.
I have but to speak the word , and thy head will lie at thy feet"
Then she was forced to obey , and put on the bride 's magnificent clothes and all her jewels.
He took her by the hand and led her to church.
`` What art thou saying ?"
asked the King 's son.
`` Nothing ,"
she replied , `` I was only thinking of Maid Maleen"
He was surprised that she knew about her , but kept silence.
When they came to the foot-plank into the churchyard , she said , `` Foot-bridge , do not break , I am not the true bride"
`` What art thou saying there ?"
asked the King 's son.
`` Nothing ,"
she replied , `` I was only thinking of Maid Maleen"
`` Dost thou know Maid Maleen ?"
`` No ,"
she answered , `` how should I know her ; I have only heard of her"
When they came to the church-door , she said once more , `` Church-door , break not , I am not the true bride"
`` What art thou saying there ?"
asked he.
`` Ah ,"
she answered , `` I was only thinking of Maid Maleen"
Then he took out a precious chain , put it round her neck , and fastened the clasp.
Thereupon they entered the church , and the priest joined their hands together before the altar , and married them.
He led her home , but she did not speak a single word the whole way.
As soon as every one had gone away , he said to her , `` What didst thou say to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside ?"
`` To which nettle-plant ?"
asked she ; `` I do n't talk to nettle-plants"
`` If thou didst not do it , then thou art not the true bride ,"
said he.
So she bethought herself , and said , `` I must go out unto my maid , Who keeps my thoughts for me"
She went out and sought Maid Maleen.
`` Girl , what hast thou been saying to the nettle ?"
The bride ran back into the chamber , and said , `` I know now what I said to the nettle ,"
and she repeated the words which she had just heard.
`` But what didst thou say to the foot-bridge when we went over it ?"
asked the King 's son.
`` To the foot-bridge ?"
she answered.
`` I do n't talk to foot-bridges"
`` Then thou art not the true bride"
She again said , `` I must go out unto my maid , Who keeps my thoughts for me ,"
And ran out and found Maid Maleen , `` Girl , what didst thou say to the foot-bridge ?"
`` I said nothing but , `` Foot-bridge , do not break , I am not the true bride"
`` That costs thee thy life !"
cried the bride , but she hurried into the room , and said , `` I know now what I said to the foot-bridge ,"
and she repeated the words.
`` But what didst thou say to the church-door ?"
`` To the church-door ?"
she replied ; `` I do n't talk to church-doors"
`` Then thou art not the true bride"
She went out and found Maid Maleen , and said , `` Girl , what didst thou say to the church-door ?"
`` I said nothing but , `` Church-door , break not , I am not the true bride"
`` That will break thy neck for thee !"
and she repeated the words.
`` But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door ?"
`` What jewel ?"
she answered ; `` thou didst not give me any jewel"
`` I myself put it round thy neck , and I myself fastened it ; if thou dost not know that , thou art not the true bride"
`` Where is the girl ?"
said he ; `` I want to see her , go and bring her here"
Lights were brought , and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door.
`` Thou art the true bride ,"
said he , `` who went with me to the church ; come with me now to my room"
To-day , however , the sun is shining on me once more.
I was married to thee in the church , and I am thy lawful wife"
Then they kissed each other , and were happy all the days of their lives.
The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off.
Little Hans , with your coat so gay , Follow me , follow me , fast as you may"
There was once on a time a princess who was extremely proud.
If a wooer came she gave him some riddle to guess , and if he could not find it out , he was sent contemptuously away.
She let it be made known also that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her , let him be who he might.
Then said the princess , `` I have two kinds of hair on my head , of what color is it ?"
`` If that be all ,"
said the first , `` it must be black and white , like the cloth which is called pepper and salt"
The princess said , `` Wrongly guessed ; let the second answer"
Then said the second , `` If it be not black and white , then it is brown and red , like my father 's company coat"
`` Wrongly guessed ,"
said the princess , `` let the third give the answer , for I see very well he knows it for certain"
When her courage returned she said , `` Thou hast not won me yet by that ; there is still something else that thou must do.
The little tailor did not let himself be frightened away , but was quite delighted , and said , `` Boldly ventured is half won"
When therefore the evening came , our little tailor was taken down to the bear.
The bear was about to set at the little fellow at once , and give him a hearty welcome with his paws : `` Softly , softly ,"
said the little tailor , `` I will soon make thee quiet"
When the bear saw that , he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too.
The tailor felt in his pockets , and reached him a handful ; they were , however , not nuts , but pebbles.
The bear put them in his mouth , but could get nothing out of them , let him bite as he would.
`` Eh !"
thought he , `` what a stupid blockhead I am ! I can not even crack a nut !"
and then he said to the tailor , `` Here , crack me the nuts"
`` There , see what a stupid fellow thou art !"
said the little tailor , `` to have such a great mouth , and not be able to crack a small nut !"
said the bear ; `` when I watch you , I then think I ought to be able to do it too"
So the tailor once more gave him a pebble , and the bear tried and tried to bite into it with all the strength of his body.
But no one will imagine that he accomplished it.
When that was over , the tailor took out a violin from beneath his coat , and played a piece of it to himself.
`` Light enough for a child.
`` So ,"
said the bear ; `` fiddling is a thing I should like to understand too , that I might dance whenever I had a fancy.
What dost thou think of that ? Wilt thou give me lessons ?"
`` With all my heart ,"
said the tailor , `` if thou hast a talent for it.
But just let me see thy claws , they are terribly long , I must cut thy nails a little"
and he let the bear growl as he liked , and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw , and fell asleep.
The bear in great fury ran after the carriage.
When the bear saw that , he turned round and ran away.
The tailor drove quietly to church , and the princess was married to him at once , and he lived with her as happy as a woodlark.
Whosoever does not believe this , must pay a thaler"
There was once a wizard who used to take the form of a poor man , and went to houses and begged , and caught pretty girls.
No one knew whither he carried them , for they were never seen more.
Thereupon he hurried away with long strides , and carried her away into a dark forest to his house , which stood in the midst of it.
She took the keys and the egg , and promised to obey him in everything.
When he was gone , she went all round the house from the bottom to the top , and examined everything.
The rooms shone with silver and gold , and she thought she had never seen such great splendor.
At length she came to the forbidden door ; she wished to pass it by , but curiosity let her have no rest.
She was so terribly alarmed that the egg which she held in her hand fell into the basin.
She got it out and washed the blood off , but in vain , it appeared again in a moment.
She washed and scrubbed , but she could not get it out.
It was not long before the man came back from his journey , and the first things which he asked for were the key and the egg.
`` Since thou hast gone into the room against my will ,"
said he , `` thou shalt go back into it against thine own.
Thy life is ended"
Then he threw her into the basin with the rest.
`` Now I will fetch myself the second ,"
said the wizard , and again he went to the house in the shape of a poor man , and begged.
Then the second daughter brought him a piece of bread ; he caught her like the first , by simply touching her , and carried her away.
She did not fare better than her sister.
Then he went and brought the third sister , but she was clever and crafty.
Alas , what did she behold ! Both her sisters lay there in the basin , cruelly murdered , and cut in pieces.
But she began to gather their limbs together and put them in order , head , body , arms and legs.
Then they rejoiced and kissed and caressed each other.
He now had no longer any power over her , and was forced to do whatsoever she desired.
`` Oh , very well ,"
The wretch shall himself carry you home again , but as soon as you are at home send help to me"
The wizard raised the basket on his back and went away with it , but it weighed him down so heavily that the perspiration streamed from his face.
Wilt thou go on at once ?"
He thought it was his bride who was calling that to him ; and got up on his legs again.
Wilt thou go on directly ?"
At home , however , the bride prepared the marriage-feast , and sent invitations to the friends of the wizard.
`` I come from Fitcher 's house quite near"
`` And what may the young bride be doing ?"
`` From cellar to garret she 's swept all clean , And now from the window she 's peeping , I ween"
At last she met the bridegroom , who was coming slowly back.
He , like the others , asked , `` O , Fitcher 's bird , how com ` st thou here ?"
`` I come from Fitcher 's house quite near"
The bridegroom looked up , saw the decked-out skull , thought it was his bride , and nodded to her , greeting her kindly.
It sounded strange , but so pleasant that they forgot all their weariness and stepped quickly onwards.
They sang to it most charmingly , and that was the music which the travellers had heard.
In the midst of them sat an old man who was rather taller than the rest.
He wore a parti-coloured coat , and his iron-grey beard hung down over his breast.
The two remained standing full of astonishment , and watched the dance.
The old man made a sign that they should enter , and the little folks willingly opened their circle.
The circle closed again directly , and the little folks went on singing and dancing with the wildest leaps.
When they had got into the valley , the clock of the neighbouring monastery struck twelve , and the song ceased.
In a moment all had vanished , and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight.
A heavy weight on their limbs awakened them earlier than usual.
But he stayed another day to please him.
He was not slow about sticking as much into his bags as would go , went back quite delighted , and covered himself over with his coat.
`` Even if the gold does weigh heavily ,"
said he , `` I will gladly bear that ,"
and at last he fell asleep with the sweet anticipation of waking in the morning an enormously rich man.
`` The gold I got the night before is still there for me ,"
thought he , and went and brought it out , but how shocked he was when he saw that it likewise had again turned into coal.
Then he recognized the punishment of his greediness , and began to weep aloud.
The story is as follows.
No sooner said than done.
The hedgehog shut the house-door behind him , and took the path to the field.
When the hedgehog caught sight of the hare , he bade him a friendly good morning.
`` I am taking a walk ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` A walk !"
said the hare , with a smile.
`` It seems to me that you might use your legs for a better purpose"
This answer made the hedgehog furiously angry , for he can bear anything but an attack on his legs , just because they are crooked by nature.
So now the hedgehog said to the hare , `` You seem to imagine that you can do more with your legs than I with mine"
`` That is just what I do think ,"
said the hare.
`` That can be put to the test ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` I wager that if we run a race , I will outstrip you"
`` That is ridiculous ! You with your short legs !"
said the hare , `` but for my part I am willing , if you have such a monstrous fancy for it.
What shall we wager ?"
`` A golden louis-d ` or and a bottle of brandy ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` Done ,"
said the hare.
`` Shake hands on it , and then we may as well come off at once"
`` Nay ,"
said the hedgehog , `` there is no such great hurry ! I am still fasting , I will go home first , and have a little breakfast.
In half-an-hour I will be back again at this place"
Hereupon the hedgehog departed , for the hare was quite satisfied with this.
He may be a great man , but he is a very silly fellow , and he shall pay for what he has said"
So when the hedgehog reached home , he said to his wife , `` Wife , dress thyself quickly , thou must go out to the field with me"
`` What is going on , then ?"
said his wife.
`` I have made a wager with the hare , for a gold louis-d ` or and a bottle of brandy.
I am to run a race with him , and thou must be present"
`` Good heavens , husband ,"
`` Hold thy tongue , woman ,"
said the hedgehog , `` that is my affair.
Do n't begin to discuss things which are matters for men.
Be off , dress thyself , and come with me"
What could the hedgehog 's wife do ? She was forced to obey him , whether she liked it or not.
Look you , I will make the long field our race-course.
The hare shall run in one furrow , and I in another , and we will begin to run from the top.
Then they reached the field , and the hedgehog showed his wife her place , and then walked up the field.
When he reached the top , the hare was already there.
`` Shall we start ?"
said the hare.
`` Certainly ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` Then both at once"
So saying , each placed himself in his own furrow.
The hare counted , `` Once , twice , thrice , and away !"
and went off like a whirlwind down the field.
The hedgehog , however , only ran about three paces , and then he stooped down in the furrow , and stayed quietly where he was.
The hare , however , thought to himself , `` That has not been done fairly ,"
and cried , `` It must be run again , let us have it again"
And once more he went off like the wind in a storm , so that he seemed to fly.
But the hedgehog 's wife stayed quietly in her place.
So when the hare reached the top of the field , the hedgehog himself cried out to him , `` I am here already"
The hare , however , quite beside himself with anger , cried , `` It must be run again , we must have it again"
`` All right ,"
answered the hedgehog , `` for my part we 'll run as often as you choose"
At the seventy-fourth time , however , the hare could no longer reach the end.
In the middle of the field he fell to the ground , blood streamed out of his mouth , and he lay dead on the spot.
So whosoever is a hedgehog let him see to it that his wife is a hedgehog also , and so forth"
Long , long ago there lived an old man and his wife who supported themselves by cultivating a small plot of land.
Their life had been a very happy and peaceful one save for one great sorrow , and this was they had no child.
Their only pet was a dog named person_0 , and on him they lavished all the affection of their old age.
Indeed , they loved him so much that whenever they had anything nice to eat they denied themselves to give it to person_0.
Now person_0 means `` white ,"
and he was so called because of his color.
He was a real Japanese dog , and very like a small wolf in appearance.
Sure enough , person_0 was waiting for his master and the evening tit-bit.
Then the old man said `` Chin , chin !"
and person_0 sat up and begged , and his master gave him the food.
Whenever person_0 happened to look into their kitchen they at once kicked him or threw something at him , sometimes even wounding him.
One day person_0 was heard barking for a long time in the field at the back of his master 's house.
The old man , thinking that perhaps some birds were attacking the corn , hurried out to see what was the matter.
Here he began to dig very industriously with his paws , yelping with joy all the time.
The old man , unable to understand what it all meant , stood looking on in bewilderment.
But person_0 went on barking and digging with all his might.
The thought that something might be hidden beneath the tree , and that the dog had scented it , at last struck the old man.
He ran back to the house , fetched his spade and began to dig the ground at that spot.
So intent was the old man on his work that he never saw the cross face of his neighbor peering at him through the bamboo hedge.
At last all the gold coins lay shining on the ground.
The old man ran in to call his wife , and together they carried home the treasure.
Thus in one day the poor old man became rich.
His gratitude to the faithful dog knew no bounds , and he loved and petted him more than ever , if that were possible.
The cross old neighbor , attracted by person_0 's barking , had been an unseen and envious witness of the finding of the treasure.
He began to think that he , too , would like to find a fortune.
So a few days later he called at the old man 's house and very ceremoniously asked permission to borrow person_0 for a short time.
He then took his spade and hastened to his own field , forcing the unwilling person_0 to follow him.
You must find them for me ! Where are they ? Where ? Where ?"
As he went on digging a foul smell was noticeable , and he at last came upon a refuse heap.
The old man 's disgust can be imagined.
This soon gave way to anger.
Instead of blaming his own greed for his disappointment , he blamed the poor dog.
He seized his spade , and with all his strength struck person_0 and killed him on the spot.
Then he returned to the house , telling no one , not even his wife , what be had done.
After waiting several days , as the dog person_0 did not return , his master began to grow anxious.
Day after day went by and the good old man waited in vain.
Then he went to his neighbor and asked him to give him back his dog.
Without any shame or hesitation , the wicked neighbor answered that he had killed person_0 because of his bad behavior.
At this dreadful news person_0 's master wept many sad and bitter tears.
Great indeed , was his woful surprise , but he was too good and gentle to reproach his bad neighbor.
person_0 's master then cut the tree down and carried it home.
Out of the trunk he made a mortar.
When the old man and his wife saw this , they understood that it was a reward to them from person_0 for their faithful love to him.
They tasted the cakes and found them nicer than any other food.
So from this time they never troubled about food , for they lived upon the cakes with which the mortar never ceased to supply them.
The old man did not in the least wish to lend it to his cruel neighbor , but he was too kind to refuse.
So the envious man carried home the mortar , but he never brought it back.
He found him sitting by a big fire made of pieces of wood.
On the ground lay what looked very much like pieces of a broken mortar.
The good old man said : `` I am very sorry for that.
It is a great pity you did not ask me for the cakes if you wanted them.
I would have given you as many as ever you wanted.
Now please give me the ashes of the mortar , as I wish to keep them in remembrance of my dog"
The neighbor consented at once , and the old man carried home a basket full of ashes.
Not long after this the old man accidentally scattered some of the ashes made by the burning of the mortar on the trees of his garden.
The old man 's delight knew no bounds , and he carefully preserved the remaining ashes.
The story of the old man 's garden spread far and wide , and people from far and near came to see the wonderful sight.
The Knight was sore perplexed when he saw what great displeasure the loss of his favorite cherry tree caused the Daimio.
`` And ,"
added the Knight , `` I shall be very much obliged if you will come at once"
The good old man was greatly surprised at what he heard , but respectfully followed the Knight to the nobleman 's Palace.
The old man made an obeisance , and replied : `` I am that old man !"
Then the Daimio said : `` You must make that dead cherry tree in my garden blossom again by means of your famous ashes.
I shall look on"
Then they all went into the garden -- the Daimio and his retainers and the ladies-in waiting , who carried the Daimio 's sword.
The old man now tucked up his kimono and made ready to climb the tree.
Saying `` Excuse me ,"
he took the pot of ashes which he had brought with him , and began to climb the tree , every one watching his movements with great interest.
He rose to his feet and spread out his fan , calling the old man down from the tree.
and that henceforth all were to recognize him by this name , and he sent him home with great honor.
This would be the simplest task of all.
So he set to work and gathered together all the ashes which remained in the fire-place from the burning of the wonderful mortar.
The Daimio in his Palace heard this cry , and said : `` That must be the Hana-Saka-Jijii passing.
I have nothing to do to - day.
Let him try his art again ; it will amuse me to look on"
So the retainers went out and brought in the impostor before their Lord.
The satisfaction of false old man can now be imagined.
And the envious neighbor answered with a lie : `` Yes , my Lord !"
`` That is strange !"
said the Daimio.
`` I thought there was only one Hana-Saka-Jijii in the world ! Has he now some disciples ?"
`` I am the true Hana-Saka-Jijii.
The one who came to you before was only my disciple !"
replied the old man again.
`` Then you must be more skillful than the other.
Try what you can do and let me see !"
But not only did the tree not burst into flower , but not even a bud came forth.
Thinking that he had not used enough ashes , the old man took handfuls and again sprinkled them over the withered tree.
But all to no effect.
After trying several times , the ashes were blown into the Daimio 's eyes.
This made him very angry , and he ordered his retainers to arrest the false Hana-Saka-Jijii at once and put him in prison for an impostor.
From this imprisonment the wicked old man was never freed.
Thus did he meet with punishment at last for all his evil doings.
A duck arrived from Portugal.
Some said she came from Spain , but that 's all the same.
At any rate she was called the person_0 , and laid eggs , and was killed and cooked , and that was _ her _ career.
But the ducklings which crept forth from her eggs were afterwards also called person_0 , and there is something in that.
`` He annoys me with his loud crowing !"
observed the person_0 duck.
`` But he 's a handsome bird , there 's no denying that , though he is not a drake.
How charmingly they sing ! There 's something quite pretty in their warbling.
I call it Portugal.
And while she was still speaking , a little singing bird came head over heels from the roof into the yard.
The cat was behind him , but the bird escaped with a broken wing , and that 's how he came tumbling into the yard.
`` That 's just like the cat ; she 's a villain !"
said the person_0 duck.
`` I remember her ways when I had children of my own.
That such a creature should be allowed to live , and to wander about upon the roofs ! I do n't think they do such things in Portugal !"
And she pitied the little singing bird , and the other ducks who were not of person_0 descent pitied him too.
`` Poor little creature !"
they said , as one after another came up.
`` We certainly ca n't sing ,"
`` But I can talk of it ,"
said the person_0 duck ; `` and I 'll do something for the little fellow , for that 's my duty !"
`` That 's a good deed ,"
she said : `` the others may take example by it"
`` Piep !"
`` You are very kind-hearted , madam ,"
he said ; but he did not wish for a second bath.
`` I have never thought about my heart ,"
But pray make yourself at home , for one can make oneself comfortable.
I myself am from a strange country , as you may see from my bearing , and from my feathery dress.
`` She 's quite full of Portulak ,"
It was too witty ! And all the other ducks now began to notice the little singing bird.
`` The person_0 has certainly a greater command of language ,"
they said.
`` For our part , we do n't care to fill our beaks with such long words , but our sympathy is just as great.
If we do n't do anything for you , we march about with you everywhere ; and we think that the best thing we can do"
`` You have a lovely voice ,"
said one of the oldest.
`` It must be a great satisfaction to be able to give so much pleasure as you are able to impart.
`` Do n't plague him so ,"
interposed the person_0 duck : `` he requires rest and nursing.
My little singing bird , do you wish me to prepare another bath for you ?"
`` Oh no ! pray let me be dry !"
was the little bird 's petition.
`` The water-cure is the only remedy for me when I am unwell ,"
quoth the person_0.
`` Amusement is beneficial too ! The neighbouring fowls will soon come to pay their visit.
There are two Cochin Chinese among them.
They wear feathers on their legs , are well educated , and have been brought from afar , consequently they stand higher than the others in my regard"
And the fowls came , and the cock came ; to-day he was polite enough to abstain from being rude.
`` You are a true singing bird ,"
he said , `` and you do as much with your little voice as can possibly be done with it.
But one requires a little more shrillness , that every hearer may hear that one is a male"
The two Chinese stood quite enchanted with the appearance of the singing bird.
He looked very much rumpled after his bath , so that he seemed to them to have quite the appearance of a little Cochin China fowl.
`` He 's charming ,"
they cried , and began a conversation with him , speaking in whispers , and using the most aristocratic Chinese dialect.
-LRB- Illustration : THE LITTLE SINGING BIRD RECEIVES DISTINGUISHED PATRONAGE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` We are of your race ,"
they continued.
`` The ducks , even the person_0 , are swimming birds , as you can not fail to have noticed.
Except us two and the cock , there 's no one in the whole poultry-yard who is at once talented and polite.
It can not even be said of the inhabitants of the duck-yard.
We warn you , little singing bird : do n't trust that one yonder with the short tail feathers , for she 's cunning.
The person_0 is the only one who has any education , and with whom one can associate , but she is passionate , and talks too much about Portugal"
`` I wonder what those two Chinese are always whispering to one another about ,"
whispered one duck to her friend.
`` They annoy me -- we have never spoken to them"
Now the drake came up.
He thought the little singing bird was a sparrow.
`` Well , I do n't understand the difference ,"
he said ; `` and indeed it 's all the same thing.
He 's only a plaything , and if one has them , why , one has them"
`` Do n't attach any value to what he says ,"
the person_0 whispered.
`` He 's very respectable in business matters ; and with him business takes precedence of everything.
But now I shall lie down for a rest.
One owes that to oneself , that one may be nice and fat when one is to be embalmed with apples and plums"
The little singing bird busied himself with his broken wing.
But the neighbour 's fowls were awake.
The Chinese were the first to leave the duck-yard ; and the other fowls soon followed them.
The witty little duck said of the person_0 that the old lady was becoming a ducky dotard.
At this the other ducks laughed and cackled aloud.
`` Ducky dotard ,"
they whispered ; `` that 's too witty !"
and then they repeated the former joke about Portulak , and declared that it was vastly amusing.
And then they lay down.
They had been lying asleep for some time , when suddenly something was thrown into the yard for them to eat.
It came down with such a thwack , that the whole company started up from sleep and clapped their wings.
The person_0 awoke too , and threw herself over on the other side , pressing the little singing bird very hard as she did so.
`` Piep !"
he cried ; `` you trod very hard upon me , madam"
`` Well , why do you lie in my way ?"
the duck retorted.
`` You must not be so touchy.
I have nerves of my own , but yet I never called out ` Piep ! ' `` Do n't be angry ,"
said the little bird `` the ` piep ' came out of my beak unawares"
The person_0 did not listen to him , but began eating as fast as she could , and made a good meal.
`` Now I want to rest after my dinner ,"
said the person_0.
`` You must conform to the rules of the house while you 're here.
I want to sleep now"
The little singing bird was quite taken aback , for he had meant it kindly.
`` Give that to a chicken !"
she said , `` and do n't be always standing in my way"
`` Why are you angry with me ?"
replied the little singing bird.
`` What have I done ?"
`` Done !"
repeated the person_0 duck : `` your mode of expression is not exactly genteel ; a fact to which I must call your attention"
`` Yesterday it was sunshine here ,"
said the little bird , `` but to-day it 's cloudy and the air is close"
`` You do n't know much about the weather , I fancy ,"
retorted the person_0.
`` The day is not done yet.
Do n't stand there looking so stupid"
`` But you are looking at me just as the wicked eyes looked when I fell into the yard yesterday"
`` Impertinent creature !"
I 've taken your part , and will teach you good manners"
And so saying , she bit off the singing bird 's head , and he lay dead on the ground.
`` Now , what 's the meaning of this ?"
she said , `` could he not bear even that ? Then certainly he was not made for this world.
I 've been like a mother to him I know that , for I 've a good heart"
Then the neighbour 's cock stuck his head into the yard , and crowed with steam-engine power.
`` You 'll kill me with your crowing !"
she cried.
`` It 's all your fault.
He 's lost his head , and I am very near losing mine"
`` There 's not much lying where he fell !"
observed the cock.
`` Speak of him with respect ,"
retorted the person_0 duck , `` for he had song , manners , and education.
He was affectionate and soft , and that 's as good in animals , as in your so-called human beings"
And all the ducks came crowding round the little dead singing bird.
`` We shall never get such a singing bird again ; he was almost a Chinese ,"
they whispered , and they wept with a mighty clucking sound , and all the fowls clucked too ; but the ducks went about with the redder eyes.
`` We 've hearts of our own ,"
they said ; `` nobody can deny that"
`` Hearts !"
repeated the person_0 , `` yes , that we have , almost as much as in Portugal"
`` Let us think of getting something to satisfy our hunger ,"
said the drake , `` for that 's the most important point.
If one of our toys is broken , why , we have plenty more !"
Whenever this woman gave her anything to do , she worked at it indefatigably , and did everything that lay in her power.
Still she could not touch the heart of the wicked woman by that ; she was never satisfied ; it was never enough.
Dost thou imagine thou art to idle away the whole day ?"
Then she heard a low voice which said , `` Be comforted , my child , I have come to help thee"
The maiden looked up , and an old woman was by her side.
She took the girl kindly by the hand , and said , `` Only tell me what is troubling thee"
The girl lay down on her bed , and soon fell asleep.
The maiden thanked God , and sat still till evening came , when the step-mother came in and marvelled to see the work completed.
`` Just look , you awkward creature ,"
When she went out she said , `` The creature is worth more than her salt.
I must give her some work that is still harder"
She set to work at once , knelt down by the water , into which her tears were falling , and began to empty it.
Go into the thicket and lie down and sleep ; I will soon do thy work"
She went to her step-mother , and showed her that the work was done.
`` It ought to have been done long before this ,"
said she , and grew white with anger , but she meditated something new.
The maiden was dismayed , and said , `` How can I complete such a great work ?"
`` I will endure no opposition ,"
screamed the step-mother.
`` If thou canst empty a pond with a spoon that is full of holes , thou canst build a castle too.
She sat down and wept , and still she hoped the old woman would help her.
If it would be a pleasure to thee , thou canst live in it thyself"
When the maiden had gone away , the old woman touched the gray rocks.
There was a dull heavy noise from the ground ; pillars arose of their own accord on high , and placed themselves in order near each other.
The inside of the castle was being finished while evening was drawing near.
The sun was just setting when the girl awoke , and the brightness of a thousand lights flashed in her face.
She hurried to the castle , and entered by the open door.
The steps were spread with red cloth , and the golden balustrade beset with flowering trees.
When she saw the splendor of the apartment , she stood as if turned to stone.
Who knows how long she might have stood there if she had not remembered the step-mother ? `` Alas !"
she said to herself , `` if she could but be satisfied at last , and would give up making my life a misery to me"
The girl went and told her that the castle was ready.
`` I will move into it at once ,"
said she , and rose from her seat.
When they entered the castle , she was forced to hold her hand before her eyes , the brilliancy of everything was so dazzling.
`` Thou seest ,"
said she to the girl , `` how easy it has been for thee to do this ; I ought to have given thee something harder"
She went through all the rooms , and examined every corner to see if anything was wanting or defective ; but she could discover nothing.
`` Now we will go down below ,"
said she , looking at the girl with malicious eyes.
`` The kitchen and the cellar still have to be examined , and if thou hast forgotten anything thou shalt not escape thy punishment"
Nothing was wanting , not even a coal-box and water-pail.
`` Which is the way to the cellar ?"
she cried.
`` If that is not abundantly filled , it shall go ill with thee"
She herself raised up the trap-door and descended ; but she had hardly made two steps before the heavy trap-door which was only laid back , fell down.
And now the magnificent castle belonged to the girl alone.
She at first did not know how to reconcile herself to her good fortune.
And soon the fame of the beauty and riches of the maiden went over all the world.
Wooers presented themselves daily , but none pleased her.
At length the son of the King came and he knew how to touch her heart , and she betrothed herself to him.
I entreat thee to wait for me here under this lime-tree , I shall be back with thee in a few hours"
I will wait here under the lime-tree until thou returnest"
The maid stayed beneath the lime-tree until sunset , but he did not return.
She sat three days from morning till evening , waiting for him , but in vain.
As he still was not there by the fourth day , she said , `` Some accident has assuredly befallen him.
I will go out and seek him , and will not come back until I have found him"
She inquired everywhere for her betrothed , but no one had seen him ; no one knew anything about him.
Far and wide did she wander through the world , but she found him not.
At last she hired herself to a farmer as a cow-herd , and buried her dresses and jewels beneath a stone.
the little calf knelt down , and she stroked it.
`` Alas !"
said she , `` I believed him true to me , but he has forgotten me"
Next day he again came along the road.
When he was aware of the voice , he looked down and reined in his horse.
`` Alas !"
said she , `` he no longer knows me ,"
and her grief was ever greater.
Soon after this a great festival three days long was to be held at the King 's court , and the whole country was invited to it.
`` Now will I try my last chance ,"
thought the maiden , and when evening came she went to the stone under which she had buried her treasures.
She took out the dress with the golden suns , put it on , and adorned herself with the jewels.
When she entered the brightly-lighted hall , every one started back in amazement , but no one knew who she was.
The King 's son went to meet her , but he did not recognize her.
He led her out to dance , and was so enchanted with her beauty , that he thought no more of the other bride.
Next evening she took out the dress with the silver moons , and put a half-moon made of precious stones in her hair.
Before she went away she was forced to promise him to come again to the festival on the last evening.
The prince had already been waiting for her for a long time , and forced his way up to her.
`` Do but tell who thou art ,"
said he , `` I feel just as if I had already known thee a long time"
`` Dost thou not know what I did when thou leftest me ?"
`` Come ,"
said he to her , `` here I stay no longer ,"
gave her his hand , and led her down to the carriage.
The horses hurried away to the magic castle as if the wind had been harnessed to the carriage.
The illuminated windows already shone in the distance.
When they drove past the lime-tree , countless glow-worms were swarming about it.
It shook its branches , and sent forth their fragrance.
Long , long ago there lived a man called person_1.
His surname meant `` Millionaire ,"
but although he was not so rich as all that , he was still very far removed from being poor.
One day , without any reason whatsoever , the thought of death and sickness came to him.
The idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched.
`` I should like to live ,"
he said to himself , `` till I am five or six hundred years old at least , free from all sickness.
The ordinary span of a man 's life is very short"
He wondered whether it were possible , by living simply and frugally henceforth , to prolong his life as long as he wished.
person_1 had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named Shin-no - Shiko.
He was one of the most able and powerful rulers in Chinese history.
He built all the large palaces , and also the famous great wall of China.
He could not get away from it.
Ah -- if only he could find the `` Elixir of person_0 ,"
he would be happy.
The Emperor at last called a meeting of his courtiers and asked them all if they could not find for him the `` Elixir of person_0"
of which he had so often read and heard.
Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever.
So he left his old home to the care of his relatives , and started out on his quest.
He traveled through all the mountainous regions of the land , climbing to the tops of the highest peaks , but never a hermit did he find.
At last , after wandering in an unknown region for many days , he met a hunter.
`` Can you tell me ,"
asked person_1 , `` where the hermits live who have the Elixir of person_0 ?"
`` No"
said the hunter ; `` I ca n't tell you where such hermits live , but there is a notorious robber living in these parts.
It is said that he is chief of a band of two hundred followers"
You think that you would like to become a hermit so as to find the Elixir of person_0.
`` You , person_1 , are fond of good living and of every comfort.
You are not even like an ordinary man , for you are exceptionally idle , and more sensitive to heat and cold than most people.
`` In answer to your prayer , however , I will help you in another way.
I will send you to the country of Perpetual person_0 , where death never comes -- where the people live forever !"
person_1 obeyed wonderingly.
The crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort.
It then spread its wings , rose high in the air , and flew away over the mountains right out to sea.
person_1 was at first quite frightened ; but by degrees he grew accustomed to the swift flight through the air.
On and on they went for thousands of miles.
After several days they reached an island.
The crane flew some distance inland and then alighted.
As soon as person_1 got down from the bird 's back , the crane folded up of its own accord and flew into his pocket.
Now person_1 began to look about him wonderingly , curious to see what the country of Perpetual person_0 was like.
He walked first round about the country and then through the town.
Everything was , of course , quite strange , and different from his own land.
Within the memory of all the islanders no man had ever died there , and sickness was a thing unknown.
This tradition was handed down for ages from generation to generation -- but none knew exactly what death was except that it led to Paradise.
All this person_1 soon found out by talking to the islanders.
He found himself , according to his ideas , in the land of Topsyturvydom.
Everything was upside down.
He had wished to escape from dying.
What he had hitherto considered poison these people ate as good food , and all the things to which he had been accustomed as food they rejected.
Whenever any merchants from other countries arrived , the rich people rushed to them eager to buy poisons.
These they swallowed eagerly , hoping for death to come so that they might go to Paradise.
Vainly they tried to imagine what death could be like.
The wealthy would have given all their money and all their goods if they could but shorten their lives to two or three hundred years even.
Without any change to live on forever seemed to this people wearisome and sad.
He never saw any one ill after eating these horrible things , nor did he ever see any one with as much as a cold.
person_1 was delighted.
He said to himself that he would never grow tired of living , and that he considered it profane to wish for death.
He was the only happy man on the island.
For his part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy life.
He set himself up in business , and for the present never even dreamed of going back to his native land.
As years went by , however , things did not go as smoothly as at first.
He had heavy losses in business , and several times some affairs went wrong with his neighbors.
This caused him great annoyance.
Time passed like the flight of an arrow for him , for he was busy from morning till night.
No sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket.
person_1 was amazed to see that it had remained undamaged after all these years.
Once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it.
As he did so , the bird spread its wings and flew , swiftly out across the sea in the direction of Japan.
Such was the willfulness of the man 's nature that he looked back and regretted all he had left behind.
He tried to stop the bird in vain.
The crane held on its way for thousands of miles across the ocean.
Then a storm came on , and the wonderful paper crane got damp , crumpled up , and fell into the sea.
person_1 fell with it.
Very much frightened at the thought of being drowned , he cried out loudly to Jofuku to save him.
He looked round , but there was no ship in sight.
He swallowed a quantity of sea-water , which only increased his miserable plight.
While he was thus struggling to keep himself afloat , he saw a monstrous shark swimming towards him.
As it came nearer it opened its huge mouth ready to devour him.
He was in a cold perspiration with fright , and utterly bewildered.
Suddenly a bright light came towards him , and in the light stood a messenger.
But you grew weary of living there , and begged to be allowed to return to your native land so that you might die.
Jofuku , so that he might try you , allowed you to drop into the sea , and then sent a shark to swallow you up.
Your desire for death was not real , for even at that moment you cried out loudly and shouted for help"
`` It is also vain for you to wish to become a hermit , or to find the Elixir of person_0.
These things are not for such as you -- your life is not austere enough.
It is best for you to go back to your paternal home , and to live a good and industrious life.
Never neglect to keep the anniversaries of your ancestors , and make it your duty to provide for your children 's future.
The angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking , and person_1 took the lesson to heart.
Then said they , `` We can not go on thus , we had better go into the world and seek our fortune"
Then spoke the eldest , `` Now I have found the good luck I wished for , and I desire nothing more"
He took as much of the silver as he could possibly carry , and then turned back and went home again.
But the two others said , `` We want something more from good luck than mere silver ,"
and did not touch it , but went onwards.
After they had walked for two days longer without stopping , they came to a hill which was all gold.
The second brother stopped , took thought with himself , and was undecided.
`` What shall I do ?"
At length he made a decision , and putting as much into his pockets as would go in , said farewell to his brother , and went home.
When he got down he saw with astonishment a table beneath the tree richly spread with food , the steam of which rose up to meet him.
`` This time ,"
said he , `` my wish has been fulfilled at the right moment"
and folded it up tidily and put it in his pocket.
and scarcely had the wish crossed his lips than as many dishes with the most exquisite food on them stood on the table as there was room for.
`` Now I perceive ,"
said he , `` in what kitchen my cooking is done.
Thou shalt be dearer to me than the mountains of silver and gold"
For he saw plainly that it was a wishing-cloth.
`` Good evening , blackbird !"
said the youth.
`` How dost thou get on in thy solitude ?"
`` One day is like another ,"
replied the charcoal-burner , `` and every night potatoes ! Hast thou a mind to have some , and wilt thou be my guest ?"
`` Many thanks ,"
`` Who is to prepare it for thee ?"
said the charcoal-burner.
`` I see that thou hast nothing with thee , and there is no one within a two hours ' walk who could give thee anything"
`` And yet there shall be a meal ,"
answered the youth , `` and better than any thou hast ever tasted"
Thereupon he brought his cloth out of his knapsack , spread it on the ground , and said , `` Little cloth , cover thyself ,"
and instantly boiled meat and baked meat stood there , and as hot as if it had just come out of the kitchen.
The charcoal-burner stared , but did not require much pressing ; he fell to , and thrust larger and larger mouthfuls into his black mouth.
`` I must first know what these wonderful powers are ,"
answered the youth.
`` That will I tell thee ,"
`` So far as I am concerned ,"
said the youth , `` if nothing else can be done , we will exchange ,"
and he gave the charcoal-burner the cloth , took the knapsack from the hook , put it on , and bade farewell.
When he had walked a while , he wished to make a trial of the magical powers of his knapsack and tapped it.
Immediately the seven warriors stepped up to him , and the corporal said , `` What does my lord and ruler wish for ?"
`` March with all speed to the charcoal-burner , and demand my wishing-cloth back"
The young man bade them retire , went onwards , and hoped fortune would shine yet more brightly on him.
By sunset he came to another charcoal-burner , who was making his supper ready by the fire.
`` If thou wilt eat some potatoes with salt , but with no dripping , come and sit down with me ,"
said the sooty fellow.
`` No , he replied , this time thou shalt be my guest ,"
and he spread out his cloth , which was instantly covered with the most beautiful dishes.
They ate and drank together , and enjoyed themselves heartily.
The hat is of no use to me , and I will willingly give it for thy table-cloth"
`` That suits me very well ,"
he answered , took the hat , put it on , and left his table-cloth behind him.
Hardly , however , had he walked away than he tapped on his knapsack , and his soldiers had to fetch the cloth back again.
`` One thing comes on the top of another ,"
thought he , `` and I feel as if my luck had not yet come to an end"
Neither had his thoughts deceived him.
When any one blew it all the walls and fortifications fell down , and all towns and villages became ruins.
`` Now ,"
said he , `` I am a made man , and it is time for me to go home and see how my brothers are getting on"
When he reached home , his brothers had built themselves a handsome house with their silver and gold , and were living in clover.
He will come in his carriage in full splendor like a mighty king , not like a beggar ,"
and they drove him out of doors.
Then he fell into a rage , and tapped his knapsack until a hundred and fifty men stood before him armed from head to foot.
The King said , `` This vagabond is not brought to order yet ,"
and next day sent a still larger troop against him , but they could do even less.
`` And now ,"
said he , `` I will not make peace until the King gives me his daughter to wife , and I govern the whole kingdom in his name"
She wished much to get rid of him , and night and day studied how she could accomplished this.
Then she thought to herself , `` Is it possible that his wonderful powers lie in the knapsack ?"
`` Dear child ,"
said he , `` this knapsack is my greatest treasure ; as long as I have it , there is no power on earth that I am afraid of"
And he revealed to her the wonderful virtue with which it was endowed.
They obeyed , and the false wife sent still more men after him , who were to drive him quite out of the country.
Then he would have been ruined if he had not had the little hat.
But his hands were scarcely at liberty before he turned it twice.
Immediately the cannon began to thunder , and struck down everything , and the King 's daughter herself was forced to come and beg for mercy.
As she entreated in such moving terms , and promised amendment , he allowed himself to be persuaded and granted her peace.
But the horn still remained to him , and in great anger he blew it with all his strength.
Instantly all walls , fortifications , towns , and villages , toppled down , and crushed the King and his daughter to death.
Then no one opposed him any longer , and he made himself King of the whole country"
As they were running about , the crab found a rice - dumpling and the monkey a persimmon-seed.
The crab picked up the rice-dumpling and showed it to the monkey , saying : `` Look what a nice thing I have found !"
Then the monkey held up his persimmon-seed and said : `` I also have found something good ! Look !"
Now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit , he had no use for the seed he had just found.
The persimmon-seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone.
He , therefore , in his greedy nature , felt very envious of the crab 's nice dumpling , and he proposed an exchange.
The simple-minded crab could not resist the monkey 's clever persuasion.
He at last gave in and consented to the monkey 's proposal , and the exchange was made.
The greedy monkey soon gobbled up the dumpling , and with great reluctance gave up the persimmon - seed to the crab.
He would have liked to keep that too , but he was afraid of making the crab angry and of being pinched by his sharp scissor-like claws.
They then separated , the monkey going home to his forest trees and the crab to his stones along the river-side.
As soon as the crab reached home he put the persimmon-seed in the ground as the monkey had told him.
In the following spring the crab was delighted to see the shoot of a young tree push its way up through the ground.
Each year it grew bigger , till at last it blossomed one spring , and in the following autumn bore some fine large persimmons.
Among the broad smooth green leaves the fruit hung like golden balls , and as they ripened they mellowed to a deep orange.
`` How delicious they will be to eat !"
he said to himself.
At last , one day , he knew the persimmons must be quite ripe and he wanted very much to taste one.
He determined to ask the monkey to help him , and set out to find him.
He was soon wide awake , however , when he heard himself called , and eagerly listening to what the crab told him.
He consented to go with the crab to pick the fruit for him.
He quickly climbed the tree and began to pluck and eat , as fast as he could , one persimmon after another.
Each time he chose the best and ripest he could find , and went on eating till he could eat no more.
He was so disappointed that he ran round and round the tree calling to the monkey to remember his promise.
The persimmon is as hard as stone when it is unripe.
The monkey 's missile struck home and the crab was sorely hurt by the blow.
There he lay a pitiful sight at the foot of the tree he had himself planted.
Now the crab had a son who had been playing with a friend not far from the spot where this sad work had taken place.
At this dreadful sight the poor young crab sat down and wept.
He looked about for some clue which would lead him to discover the murderer.
Alas ! He at first thought of going to attack the monkey at once , for he burned with rage.
Second thoughts , however , told him that this was useless , for the monkey was an old and cunning animal and would be hard to overcome.
The young crab set out at once to call on the mortar , his father 's old friend , and told him of all that had happened.
He besought the mortar with tears to help him avenge his father 's death.
The mortar was very sorry when he heard the woful tale and promised at once to help the young crab punish the monkey to death.
He warned him that he must be very careful in what he did , for the monkey was a strong and cunning enemy.
The mortar now sent to fetch the bee and the chestnut -LRB- also the crab 's old friends -RRB- to consult them about the matter.
In a short time the bee and the chestnut arrived.
After talking for a long time as to the ways and means of carrying out their plans they separated , and Mr.
Mortar went home with the young crab to help him bury his poor father.
He thought it quite a fine thing that he had robbed his friend of all his ripe persimmons and then that he had killed him.
Still , smile as hard as he might , he could not banish altogether the fear of the consequences should his evil deeds be discovered.
So he would not go out , and kept himself at home for several days.
He wanted to find out what the crabs were saving about their chief 's death , for the old crab had been the chief of the tribe.
But he heard nothing and said to himself : `` They are all such fools that they do n't know and do n't care who murdered their chief !"
Little did he know in his so-called `` monkey 's wisdom"
that this seeming unconcern was part of the young crab 's plan.
He purposely pretended not to know who killed his father , and also to believe that he had met his death through his own fault.
By this means he could the better keep secret the revenge on the monkey , which he was meditating.
So the monkey returned home from his walk quite content.
He told himself he had nothing now to fear.
One fine day , when the monkey was sitting at home , he was surprised by the appearance of a messenger from the young crab.
My master hopes you will honor his house with your kind visit"
When the monkey heard these words he rejoiced in his inmost heart , for all his fears of being suspected were now at rest.
He could not guess that a plot had just been set in motion against him.
We were great friends as you know.
I remember that we once exchanged a rice - dumpling for a persimmon-seed.
It grieves me much to think that that seed was in the end the cause of his death.
I accept your kind invitation with many thanks.
I shall be delighted to do honor to my poor old friend !"
And he screwed some false tears from his eyes.
The messenger laughed inwardly and thought , `` The wicked monkey is now dropping false tears , but within a short time he shall shed real ones"
But aloud he thanked the monkey politely and went home.
He changed his dress and set out solemnly to visit the young crab.
He found all the members of the crab 's family and his relatives waiting to receive and welcome him.
As soon as the bows of meeting were over they led him to a hall.
Here the young chief mourner came to receive him.
The feast over , he was next invited to the tea-ceremony room to drink a cup of tea.
When the young crab had conducted the monkey to the tearoom he left him and retired.
Time passed and still he did not return.
At last the monkey became impatient.
He said to himself : `` This tea ceremony is always a very slow affair.
I am tired of waiting so long.
I am very thirsty after drinking so much sake at the dinner !"
It was the chestnut , one of the crab 's friends , who had hidden himself in the fireplace.
The monkey , taken by surprise , jumped backward , and then started to run out of the room.
The bee , who was hiding outside the screens , now flew out and stung him on the cheek.
`` Then you -- are -- my -- enemy ?"
gasped the monkey brokenly.
`` Of course ,"
said the young crab.
`` It -- was -- your -- father 's -- fault -- not -- mine !"
gasped the unrepentant monkey.
`` Can you still lie ? I will soon put an end to your breath !"
and with that he cut off the monkey 's head with his pitcher claws.
Thus the wicked monkey met his well-merited punishment , and the young crab avenged his father 's death.
This is the end of the story of the monkey , the crab , and the persimmon-seed"
Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.
They were all good girls ; but the youngest , named Balna , was more clever than the rest.
The Raja 's wife died when they were quite little children , so these seven poor person_0 were left with no mother to take care of them.
Then Balna used to say to her sisters , `` Send that woman away ; send her away.
Let her get the fire at her own house.
What does she want with ours ? If we allow her to come here , we shall suffer for it some day"
Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters.
Next he noticed the Prudhan 's widow come to the door , and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with.
Then the eldest sister answered , `` Balna , let the poor woman take the wood and the fire ; she does us no harm"
At this he was very angry , and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him.
I can not tell how it is"
And she bade her watch the seven person_0 , and see if any one gave them anything to eat.
But the other sisters said , `` Oh no , do not be unkind , Balna.
The girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother.
Let us rather invite her to come and have some of the fruit"
And calling her to them , they gave her one of the pomeloes.
I ate one , and it was the nicest I have ever tasted"
The Raja was deeply grieved , and said to his wife , `` What can I do for you ?"
She answered , `` There is only one thing that will make my headache well.
Next day , when the seven person_0 went as usual to the grave of their mother , the pomelo tree had disappeared.
Then they all began to cry very bitterly.
Every morning the person_0 went to their mother 's grave , and found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake.
I can not tell how it is !"
And her daughter said , `` I will watch"
Next day , while the person_0 were eating the cream cake , who should come by but their step-mother 's daughter.
Balna saw her first , and said , `` See , sisters , there comes that girl again.
He replied , `` Yes , whatever it is , I will do it"
He found them crying by the ruins of their mother 's grave.
Do you not hear voices ? Let us go in the direction of the sound , and find out what it is"
So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the place where the seven person_0 sat crying and wringing their hands.
So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him , and married her.
Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of him ; and they went away , but they also did not return.
And the seven person_0 grieved very much , for they feared that their kind husbands must have been killed.
But he said , `` I am a holy man , you must let me in"
Then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace , but they did not know that this was no Fakir , but a wicked Magician named Punchkin.
Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him , or marry you"
So the poor Princess was dragged away , without any power of effecting an escape , or of letting her sisters know what had become of her.
As Punchkin passed through the palace gate the servants said to him , `` Where did you get that pretty little dog ?"
And he answered , `` One of the person_0 gave it to me as a present"
At hearing which they let him go without further questioning.
Thus time went on , till Balna 's son was fourteen years old.
So he set out on his travels ; but for some months he could learn nothing to help him in his search.
All the rocks and trees you see here were living people once , and the Magician turned them to what they now are.
Then the little Prince thought , `` These must be my parents and my uncles.
I have found what I seek at last"
To this the Prince agreed.
So the Malee 's wife dressed him up in a saree , and pretended that he was her daughter.
You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years ; now rather speak kindly.
Tell him you have given up all hopes of again seeing the husband you have so long mourned , and say you are willing to marry him.
Then endeavor to find out what his power consists in , and whether he is immortal , or can be put to death"
Balna determined to take her son 's advice ; and the next day sent for Punchkin , and spoke to him as had been suggested.
The Magician , greatly delighted , begged her to allow the wedding to take place as soon as possible.
`` And do tell me ,"
she said , `` are you quite immortal ? Can death never touch you ? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering ?"
`` Why do you ask ?"
said he.
`` Because ,"
`` It is true ,"
he added , `` that I am not as others.
Far , far away , hundreds of thousands of miles from this , there lies a desolate country covered with thick jungle.
It is , however ,"
Balna told her son what Punchkin had said ; but at the same time implored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.
So saying , he went away.
It was the middle of the day , and the heat was very great.
`` Sir ,"
replied the Prince , `` I will not sell my parrot"
Then Punchkin got frightened , and said , `` Anything , anything ; name what price you will , and it shall be yours"
The Prince answered , `` Let the seven Raja 's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly liberated"
`` It is done as you desire ,"
said the Magician , `` only give me my parrot"
And with that , by a stroke of his wand , Balna 's husband and his brothers resumed their natural shapes.
`` Now , give me my parrot ,"
repeated Punchkin.
`` Not so fast , my master ,"
rejoined the Prince ; `` I must first beg that you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned"
The Magician immediately waved his wand again ; and , whilst he cried , in an imploring voice , `` Give me my parrot !"
`` Give me my parrot !"
cried Punchkin.
Punchkin then stretched out his left arm , crying , `` Give me my parrot !"
The Prince pulled off the parrot 's second wing , and the Magician 's left arm tumbled off.
`` Give me my parrot !"
cried he , and fell on his knees.
Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head ; but still he rolled his eyes , and cried , `` Give me my parrot !"
`` Take your parrot , then ,"
And as to the rest of the world , every one went to his own house"
`` What fine linen ,"
said he , and put one piece in his pocket.
He returned home , thought no more of what he had found , and went to bed.
Just as he was going to sleep , it seemed to him as if some one was saying his name.
He listened , and was aware of a soft voice which cried to him , `` Drummer , drummer , wake up !"
As it was a dark night he could see no one , but it appeared to him that a figure was hovering about his bed.
`` What do you want ?"
he asked.
`` Give me back my dress ,"
answered the voice , `` that you took away from me last evening by the lake"
`` You shall have it back again ,"
said the drummer , `` if you will tell me who you are"
`` Ah ,"
I have to bathe in the lake every day with my two sisters , but I can not fly back again without my dress.
My sisters have gone away , but I have been forced to stay behind.
I entreat you to give me my dress back"
`` Be easy , poor child ,"
said the drummer.
`` I will willingly give it back to you"
He took it out of his pocket , and reached it to her in the dark.
She snatched it in haste , and wanted to go away with it.
`` Stop a moment , perhaps I can help you"
`` You can only help me by ascending the glass-mountain , and freeing me from the power of the witch.
But you can not come to the glass-mountain , and indeed if you were quite close to it you could not ascend it"
`` When I want to do a thing I always can do it ,"
said the drummer ; `` I am sorry for you , and have no fear of anything.
But I do not know the way which leads to the glass-mountain"
`` The road goes through the great forest , in which the man-eaters live ,"
she answered , `` and more than that , I dare not tell you"
And then he heard her wings quiver , as she flew away.
By daybreak the drummer arose , buckled on his drum , and went without fear straight into the forest.
After he had walked for a while without seeing any giants , he thought to himself , `` I must waken up the sluggards ,"
and he hung his drum before him , and beat such a reveille that the birds flew out of the trees with loud cries.
It was not long before a giant who had been lying sleeping among the grass , rose up , and was as tall as a fir-tree.
`` Wretch !"
cried he ; `` what art thou drumming here for , and wakening me out of my best sleep ?"
`` I am drumming ,"
he replied , `` because I want to show the way to many thousands who are following me"
`` What do they want in my forest ?"
demanded the giant.
`` They want to put an end to thee , and cleanse the forest of such a monster as thou art !"
`` Oho !"
said the giant , `` I will trample you all to death like so many ants"
`` Dost thou think thou canst do anything against us ?"
Every one of them has a hammer of steel in his belt , and with that they will beat in thy skull"
The giant grew angry and thought , `` If I meddle with the crafty folk , it might turn out badly for me.
I can strangle wolves and bears , but I can not protect myself from these earth-worms"
`` Listen , little fellow ,"
`` Thou hast long legs ,"
`` Come here , worm ,"
said the giant ; `` seat thyself on my shoulder , I will carry thee where thou wishest to be"
The giant lifted him up , and the drummer began to beat his drum up aloft to his heart 's delight.
The giant thought , `` That is the signal for the other people to turn back"
After a while , a second giant was standing in the road , who took the drummer from the first , and stuck him in his button-hole.
The drummer laid hold of the button , which was as large as a dish , held on by it , and looked merrily around.
Then they came to a third giant , who took him out of the button-hole , and set him on the rim of his hat.
and so it was.
The giant only made two steps more , and they reached the foot of the mountain , where the giant put him down.
He began to climb , but that was useless , for he always slipped back again.
`` If one was a bird now ,"
thought he ; but what was the good of wishing , no wings grew for him.
Whilst he was standing thus , not knowing what to do , he saw , not far from him , two men who were struggling fiercely together.
`` What fools you are ,"
said he , `` to quarrel about a saddle , when you have not a horse for it !"
`` The saddle is worth fighting about ,"
The saddle belongs to us in common.
It is my turn to ride on it , but that other man will not let me do it"
`` I will soon decide the quarrel ,"
said the drummer , and he went to a short distance and stuck a white rod in the ground.
Then he came back and said , `` Now run to the goal , and whoever gets there first , shall ride first"
He went to the door and knocked.
When he had knocked for the third time , an old woman with a brown face and red eyes opened the door.
She had spectacles on her long nose , and looked sharply at him ; then she asked what he wanted.
`` Entrance , food , and a bed for the night ,"
replied the drummer.
`` That thou shalt have ,"
said the old woman , `` if thou wilt perform three services in return"
`` Why not ?"
he answered , `` I am not afraid of any kind of work , however hard it may be"
The old woman let him go in , and gave him some food and a good bed at night.
`` That is strange work ,"
said the drummer , but he went to the pond , and began to empty it.
So he gave it up and sat down.
He looked at her , and saw that she was wondrously beautiful.
`` Ah ,"
`` Stay here ,"
said the maiden , `` I will help thee out of thy difficulty.
Thou art tired , lay thy head in my lap , and sleep.
When thou awakest again , thy work will be done"
The drummer did not need to be told that twice.
As soon as his eyes were shut , she turned a wishing-ring and said , `` Rise , water.
Fishes , come out"
When the drummer awoke , he saw with amazement that all was done.
'"
In the evening the witch came , and when she had put this question , he threw the fish in her face.
She behaved as if she did not remark it , and said nothing , but looked at him with malicious eyes.
Next morning she said , `` Yesterday it was too easy for thee , I must give thee harder work.
She gave him an axe , a mallet , and two wedges.
But the axe was made of lead , and the mallet and wedges were of tin.
When he began to cut , the edge of the axe turned back , and the mallet and wedges were beaten out of shape.
He did not know how to manage , but at mid-day the maiden came once more with his dinner and comforted him.
`` Lay thy head on my lap ,"
said she , `` and sleep ; when thou awakest , thy work will be done"
'"
The old woman came , `` There thou seest how easy the work was !"
said she ; `` but for whom hast thou left that bough which is lying there still ?"
`` For thee , thou witch ,"
he replied , and gave her a blow with it.
The maiden , however , did not desert him in his need.
She brought him his food at noon , and when he had eaten , he laid his head on her lap , and went to sleep.
When he awoke , the entire pile of wood was burning in one enormous flame , which stretched its tongues out into the sky.
`` Listen to me ,"
At last when thou hast done everything , seize her with both thy hands , and throw her into the midst of the fire"
The maiden departed , and the old woman came sneaking up to him.
`` Oh , I am cold ,"
When thou hast done that , thou art free , and mayst go where thou likest , come ; go in with a good will"
He carried the log out , and laid it down.
But the old woman laughed venomously , and said , `` Thou thinkest thou hast her safe , but thou hast not got her yet !"
Promise to be true to me , and thou shalt be my husband.
We shall not want for riches , we shall have enough with what the witch has gathered together here"
She led him into the house , where there were chests and coffers crammed with the old woman 's treasures.
The maiden left the gold and silver where it was , and took only the precious stones.
`` I do not like the old saddle ,"
said she , `` I need only turn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home"
`` Very well , then ,"
answered the drummer , `` then wish us in front of the town-gate"
`` Ah ,"
said the King 's daughter , `` I beg thee to be careful.
`` How can I forget thee ?"
said he , and promised her to come back very soon , and gave his hand upon it.
But when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek , every thought of the King 's daughter vanished from him.
He emptied out his pockets , and laid handfuls of the largest jewels on the table.
The parents had not the least idea what to do with the riches.
The son was content to do as his parents desired"
The poor King 's daughter had stood for a long time without the town waiting for the return of the young man.
When evening came , she said , `` He must certainly have kissed his parents on the right cheek , and has forgotten me"
Her heart was full of sorrow , she wished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest , and would not return to her father 's court.
Every evening she went into the town and passed the young man 's house ; he often saw her , but he no longer knew her.
At length she heard the people saying , `` The wedding will take place to-morrow"
Then she said , `` I will try if I can win his heart back"
On the first day of the wedding ceremonies , she turned her wishing-ring , and said , `` A dress as bright as the sun"
Instantly the dress lay before her , and it was as bright as if it had been woven of real sunbeams.
When all the guests were assembled , she entered the hall.
`` Not for money ,"
On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring and said , `` A dress as silvery as the moon"
But the drummer , who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught , could not be aroused.
Sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest.
But the people in the house had heard the lamentation of the stranger-maiden , and told the bridegroom about it.
On the third evening , the King 's daughter turned her wishing-ring , and said , `` A dress glittering like the stars"
The maiden gave it as she had given the others for permission to spend the night outside the bridegroom 's door.
Suddenly , his memory returned to him.
`` Ah ,"
He sprang up , took the King 's daughter by the hand , and led her to his parents ' bed.
`` This is my true bride ,"
said he ; `` if I marry the other , I shall do a great wrong"
The parents , when they heard how everything had happened , gave their consent.
The first bride received the beautiful dresses as a compensation , and declared herself satisfied"
There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage.
In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees , one of which bore white and the other red roses.
She had two children who were like the two rose-trees , and one was called Snow-white , and the other Rose-red.
Rose-red answered , `` Never so long as we live ,"
and their mother would add , `` What one has she must share with the other"
They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries , and no beasts did them any harm , but came close to them trustfully.
He got up and looked quite kindly at them , but said nothing and went away into the forest.
And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children.
Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother 's little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it.
In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the wrekin.
The kettle was of copper and shone like gold , so brightly was it polished.
In the evening , when the snowflakes fell , the mother said , `` Go , Snow-white , and bolt the door ,"
One evening , as they were thus sitting comfortably together , some one knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in.
The mother said , `` Quick , Rose-red , open the door , it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter"
Rose-red screamed and sprang back , the lamb bleated , the dove fluttered , and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother 's bed.
`` Poor bear ,"
said the mother , `` lie down by the fire , only take care that you do not burn your coat"
Then she cried , `` Snow-white , Rose-red , come out , the bear will do you no harm , he means well"
So they both came out , and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer , and were not afraid of him.
The bear said , `` Here , children , knock the snow out of my coat a little ;"
so they brought the broom and swept the bear 's hide clean ; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably.
It was not long before they grew quite at home , and played tricks with their clumsy guest.
As soon as day dawned the two children let him out , and he trotted across the snow into the forest.
`` Where are you going , then , dear bear ?"
asked Snow-white.
`` I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs.
The bear ran away quickly , and was soon out of sight behind the trees.
A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get fire-wood.
When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long.
He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried , `` Why do you stand there ? Can you not come here and help me ?"
`` What are you about there , little man ?"
asked Rose-red.
`` You stupid , prying goose !"
answered the dwarf ; `` I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.
The children tried very hard , but they could not pull the beard out , it was caught too fast.
`` I will run and fetch some one ,"
said Rose-red.
`` You senseless goose !"
snarled the dwarf ; `` why should you fetch some one ? You are already two too many for me ; can you not think of something better ?"
`` Do n't be impatient ,"
said Snow-white , `` I will help you ,"
and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket , and cut off the end of the beard.
Bad luck to you !"
and then he swung the bag upon his back , and went off without even once looking at the children.
Some time after that Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish.
As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water , as if it were going to leap in.
They ran to it and found it was the dwarf.
`` Where are you going ?"
said Rose-red ; `` you surely do n't want to go into the water ?"
`` I am not such a fool !"
cried the dwarf ; `` do n't you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in ?"
Nothing was left but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard , whereby a small part of it was lost.
I can not let myself be seen by my people.
I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes !"
It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread , and laces and ribbons.
The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn here and there.
Directly afterwards they heard a loud , piteous cry.
They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf , and was going to carry him off.
Then he took up a sack full of precious stones , and slipped away again under the rock into his hole.
The girls , who by this time were used to his thanklessness , went on their way and did their business in the town.
The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones ; they glittered and sparkled with all colors so beautifully that the children stood still and looked at them.
`` Why do you stand gaping there ?"
cried the dwarf , and his ashen-gray face became copper-red with rage.
He was going on with his bad words when a loud growling was heard , and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest.
The dwarf sprang up in a fright , but he could not get to his cave , for the bear was already close.
Then in the dread of his heart he cried , `` Dear Mr.
Come , take these two wicked girls , they are tender morsels for you , fat as young quails ; for mercy 's sake eat them !"
The bear took no heed of his words , but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw , and he did not move again.
`` I am a King 's son ,"
Now he has got his well-deserved punishment"
The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years.
She took the two rose-trees with her , and they stood before her window , and every year bore the most beautiful roses , white and red"
Long , long ago there lived , in Japan a brave warrior known to all as Tawara Toda , or `` My Lord Bag of Rice"
His true name was Fujiwara person_2 , and there is a very interesting story of how he came to change his name.
One day he sallied forth in search of adventures , for he had the nature of a warrior and could not bear to be idle.
He had not gone far when he came to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi spanning one end of the beautiful Lake Biwa.
No sooner had he set foot on the bridge than he saw lying right across his path a huge serpent - dragon.
Its body was so big that it looked like the trunk of a large pine tree and it took up the whole width of the bridge.
One of its huge claws rested on the parapet of one side of the bridge , while its tail lay right against the other.
The monster seemed to be asleep , and as it breathed , fire and smoke came out of its nostrils.
He was a brave man , however , and putting aside all fear went forward dauntlessly.
He had only gone a few steps when he heard some one calling him from behind.
person_2 knew at once that this was no ordinary mortal and he wondered much at the strange occurrence.
`` Yes , it was I ,"
answered the man : `` I have an earnest request to make to you.
Do you think you can grant it to me ?"
`` If it is in my power to do so I will ,"
answered person_2 , `` but first tell me who you are ?"
`` I am the person_1 of the Lake , and my home is in these waters just under this bridge"
`` And what is it you have to ask of me !"
said person_2.
`` I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede , who lives on the mountain beyond ,"
and the person_1 pointed to a high peak on the opposite shore of the lake.
`` I have lived now for many years in this lake and I have a large family of children and grand-children.
I am powerless to save them.
I am , therefore , very unhappy , and in my extremity I determined to ask the help of a human being.
But all who came this way , as soon as they saw me were terrified and ran away as fast as they could.
I beg you to have pity upon me.
Will you not help me and kill my enemy the centipede ?"
person_2 felt very sorry for the person_1 on hearing his story , and readily promised to do what he could to help him.
The warrior asked where the centipede lived , so that he might attack the creature at once.
So person_2 was conducted to the palace of the person_1 , under the bridge.
Never had person_2 seen anything so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake.
The dainty goldfishes , red carp , and silvery trout , waited upon the person_1 and his guest.
person_2 was astonished at the feast that was spread for him.
The dishes were crystallized lotus leaves and flowers , and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony.
Thus the hours flew by till midnight , and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the centipede.
The person_1 stood by the warrior 's side trembling with fear.
`` The centipede ! The centipede ! Those two balls of fire are its eyes.
It is coming for its prey ! Now is the time to kill it"
person_2 showed not the least sign of fear.
He tried to calm the person_1.
`` Do n't be afraid.
I shall surely kill the centipede.
Just bring me my bow and arrows"
The person_1 did as he was bid , and the warrior noticed that he had only three arrows left in his quiver.
He took the bow , and fitting an arrow to the notch , took careful aim and let fly.
The arrow hit the centipede right in the middle of its head , but instead of penetrating , it glanced off harmless and fell to the ground.
Nothing daunted , person_2 took another arrow , fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly.
The warrior saw that he had now only one arrow left in his quiver , and if this one failed he could not kill the centipede.
He looked across the waters.
The huge reptile had wound its horrid body seven times round the mountain and would soon come down to the lake.
Nearer and nearer gleamed fireballs of eyes , and the light of its hundred feet began to throw reflections in the still waters of the lake.
Then suddenly the warrior remembered that he had heard that human saliva was deadly to centipedes.
But this was no ordinary centipede.
This was so monstrous that even to think of such a creature made one creep with horror.
person_2 determined to try his last chance.
At last the dreadful night was over.
Day dawned beautiful and clear.
The centipede was gone from the mountain.
Then all the inhabitants of the palace came out with joy , and person_2 pointed to the lake.
There lay the body of the dead centipede floating on the water , which was dyed red with its blood.
The gratitude of the person_1 knew no bounds.
The whole family came and bowed down before the warrior , calling him their preserver and the bravest warrior in all Japan.
Another feast was prepared , more sumptuous than the first.
The presents that they carried were as follows : First , a large bronze bell.
Second , a bag of rice.
Third , a roll of silk.
Fourth , a cooking pot.
Fifth , a bell.
person_2 did not want to accept all these presents , but as the person_1 insisted , he could not well refuse.
As soon as the person_1 's retainers had put down the presents they vanished , and person_2 told all that had happened to him.
The presents which he had received from the grateful person_1 were found to be of magic power.
The cooking pot was wonderful , too.
No matter what was put into it , it cooked deliciously whatever was wanted without any firing -- truly a very economical saucepan.
Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed.
Every day the maiden went out to her mother 's grave , and wept , and she remained pious and good.
The woman had brought two daughters into the house with her , who were beautiful and fair of face , but vile and black of heart.
Now began a bad time for the poor step-child.
`` Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor with us ?"
said they.
`` He who wants to eat bread must earn it ; out with the kitchen-wench"
They took her pretty clothes away from her , put an old gray bedgown on her , and gave her wooden shoes.
`` Just look at the proud princess , how decked out she is !"
they cried , and laughed , and led her into the kitchen.
There she had to do hard work from morning till night , get up before daybreak , carry water , light fires , cook and wash.
.
And as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty , they called her Cinderella.
It happened that the father was once going to the fair , and he asked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them.
`` Beautiful dresses ,"
said one , `` Pearls and jewels ,"
said the second.
`` And thou , Cinderella ,"
said he , `` what wilt thou have ?"
`` Father , break off for me the first branch which knocks against your hat on your way home"
Then he broke off the branch and took it with him.
When he reached home he gave his step-daughters the things which they had wished for , and to Cinderella he gave the branch from the hazel-bush.
And it grew , however , and became a handsome tree.
`` Thou go , Cinderella !"
said she ; `` Thou art dusty and dirty and wouldst go to the festival ? Thou hast no clothes and shoes , and yet wouldst dance !"
Hardly had one hour passed before they had finished , and all flew out again.
But the step-mother said , `` No , Cinderella , thou hast no clothes and thou canst not dance ; thou wouldst only be laughed at"
And she thought to herself , `` That she most certainly can not do"
Then the maiden carried the dishes to the step-mother and was delighted , and believed that she might now go with them to the festival.
On this she turned her back on Cinderella , and hurried away with her two proud daughters.
Then the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her , and slippers embroidered with silk and silver.
She put on the dress with all speed , and went to the festival.
They never once thought of Cinderella , and believed that she was sitting at home in the dirt , picking lentils out of the ashes.
The prince went to meet her , took her by the hand and danced with her.
She danced till it was evening , and then she wanted to go home.
But the King 's son said , `` I will go with thee and bear thee company ,"
for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged.
She escaped from him , however , and sprang into the pigeon-house.
The King 's son waited until her father came , and then he told him that the stranger maiden had leapt into the pigeon-house.
The old man thought , `` Can it be Cinderella ?"
and they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew the pigeon-house to pieces , but no one was inside it.
Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the preceding day.
And when Cinderella appeared at the festival in this dress , every one was astonished at her beauty.
The King 's son had waited until she came , and instantly took her by the hand and danced with no one but her.
When others came and invited her , he said , `` She is my partner"
When evening came she wished to leave , and the King 's son followed her and wanted to see into which house she went.
But she sprang away from him , and into the garden behind the house.
Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pears.
She clambered so nimbly between the branches like a squirrel that the King 's son did not know where she was gone.
He waited until her father came , and said to him , `` The stranger-maiden has escaped from me , and I believe she has climbed up the pear-tree"
The father thought , `` Can it be Cinderella ?"
and had an axe brought and cut the tree down , but no one was on it.
And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had , and the slippers were golden.
And when she went to the festival in the dress , no one knew how to speak for astonishment.
The King 's son danced with her only , and if any one invited her to dance , he said , `` She is my partner"
The King 's son picked it up , and it was small and dainty , and all golden.
Then were the two sisters glad , for they had pretty feet.
The eldest went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on , and her mother stood by.
But she could not get her big toe into it , and the shoe was too small for her.
The maiden cut the toe off , forced the foot into the shoe , swallowed the pain , and went out to the King 's son.
Then he took her on his his horse as his bride and rode away with her.
Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was streaming from it.
Then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe , but her heel was too large.
The maiden cut a bit off her heel , forced her foot into the shoe , swallowed the pain , and went out to the King 's son.
He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe , and how it had stained her white stocking.
Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again.
`` This also is not the right one ,"
said he , `` have you no other daughter ?"
`` No ,"
said the man , `` There is still a little stunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her , but she can not possibly be the bride"
He absolutely insisted on it , and Cinderella had to be called.
She first washed her hands and face clean , and then went and bowed down before the King 's son , who gave her the golden shoe.
The step-mother and the two sisters were terrified and became pale with rage ; he , however , took Cinderella on his horse and rode away with her.
And thus , for their wickedness and falsehood , they were punished with blindness as long as they lived"
LET us proceed , howe'er -LRB- our plan explained : -RRB- A pretty servant-girl a man retain 'd.
The wife replied , you surely are deceiv 'd ; An honest , virtuous creature she 's believ 'd.
I understand you , cried the list ` ning fair ; You are deceiv 'd : -- myself alone was there.
Wife 'Twas clearly I , howe'er , for her you took.
-- Wife Indeed I do , 'twas myself.
Neighbour A flannel petticoat display 'd the elf.
Wife How hard of credence ! -- 'twas myself I vow.
Wife Why , turn her off ? -- the very thought I scoff ; She serves me well.
Neighbour And so it seems is taught ; By all means keep her then , since thus she 's thought"
There was once on a time a poor man , who could no longer support his only son.
Then said the son , `` Dear father , things go so badly with us that I am a burden to you.
I would rather go away and see how I can earn my bread"
So the father gave him his blessing , and with great sorrow took leave of him.
Then the others followed him , and he pressed on and conquered the enemy.
The King had a daughter who was very beautiful , but she was also very strange.
`` If he loves me with all his heart ,"
said she , `` of what use will life be to him afterwards ?"
On her side she would do the same , and if he died first , would go down to the grave with him.
`` But dost thou know what thou must promise ?"
said the King.
`` I must be buried with her ,"
he replied , `` if I outlive her , but my love is so great that I do not mind the danger"
Then the King consented , and the wedding was solemnized with great splendor.
The King had placed sentries at all the gates , and it was not possible to avoid his fate.
Whilst he thus gazed before him , he saw a snake creep out of a corner of the vault and approach the dead body.
and hewed the snake in three pieces.
Immediately the severed parts joined themselves together , the snake moved , and became alive again , and both of them hastened away together.
So he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his dead wife , and the two others on her eyes.
And hardly had he done this than the blood stirred in her veins , rose into her pale face , and colored it again.
Then she drew breath , opened her eyes , and said , `` Ah , God , where am I ?"
`` Thou art with me , dear wife ,"
he answered , and told her how everything had happened , and how he had brought her back again to life.
When the shameful deed was done , she said , `` Now let us return home , and say that he died on the way.
I will extol and praise thee so to my father that he will marry me to thee , and make thee the heir to his crown"
He was astonished when he saw them come alone , and asked what had happened to them.
and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep themselves hidden from every one.
Soon afterwards the great ship came sailing in , and the godless woman appeared before her father with a troubled countenance.
He said , `` Why dost thou come back alone ? Where is thy husband ?"
`` Ah , dear father ,"
He was present at his death , and can tell you all"
The King said , `` I will make the dead alive again ,"
and opened the chamber , and bade the two come out.
When the woman saw her husband , she was thunderstruck , and fell on her knees and begged for mercy.
The King said , `` There is no mercy.
The frolick , ev ` ry where is known to fame ; Conjecture if you can , and tells its name.
SHE entered as the holy monk desired , And they together to his cell retired.
The friar on the bed this maiden threw ; A kiss would take : -- she from him rather drew ; And said.
A SECOND dose the friar soon bestowed , And e ` en a third , so fast his bounty flowed.
We 'll see , rejoined the priest , that naught you lose ; But other secrets oftentimes we use.
If me thou disbeliev ` st , thy mother ask ; She thoroughly can undertake the task.
ON such a point we readily should say , Long live the fools who wit so well display !"
When darkness came on , he saw a light , which he went up to , and came to a house wherein lived a witch.
`` Do give me one night 's lodging , and a little to eat and drink ,"
said he to her , `` or I shall starve"
`` Oho !"
`` What do you wish ?"
said the soldier.
`` That you should dig all round my garden for me , tomorrow"
The soldier consented , and next day labored with all his strength , but could not finish it by the evening.
`` I see well enough ,"
The soldier spent the whole day in doing it , and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more.
`` To-morrow , you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work.
Next day the old woman took him to the well , and let him down in a basket.
He found the blue light , and made her a signal to draw him up again.
`` No ,"
said he , perceiving her evil intention , `` I will not give thee the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground"
The witch fell into a passion , let him down again into the well , and went away.
He sat for a while very sorrowfully , then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe , which was still half full.
`` This shall be my last pleasure ,"
thought he , pulled it out , lit it at the blue light and began to smoke.
When the smoke had circled about the cavern , suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him , and said , `` Lord , what are thy commands ?"
`` What commands have I to give thee ?"
replied the soldier , quite astonished.
`` I must do everything thou biddest me ,"
said the little man.
`` Good ,"
said the soldier ; `` then in the first place help me out of this well"
When he was above , he said to the little man , `` Now go and bind the old witch , and carry her before the judge"
`` It is all done ,"
said he , `` and the witch is already hanging on the gallows.
What further commands has my lord ?"
inquired the dwarf.
`` At this moment , none ,"
answered the soldier ; `` Thou canst return home , only be at hand immediately , if I summon thee"
`` Nothing more is needed than that thou shouldst light thy pipe at the blue light , and I will appear before thee at once"
Thereupon he vanished from his sight.
The soldier returned to the town from which he had come.
He went to the best inn , ordered himself handsome clothes , and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsomely as possible.
`` What am I to do ?"
asked the little man.
`` Late at night , when the King 's daughter is in bed , bring her here in her sleep , she shall do servant 's work for me"
When twelve o'clock had struck , the door sprang open , and the mannikin carried in the princess.
`` Aha ! art thou there ?"
cried the soldier , `` get to thy work at once ! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber"
and then he threw them in her face , and made her pick them up again , and clean and brighten them.
She , however , did everything he bade her , without opposition , silently and with half-shut eyes.
When the first cock crowed , the mannikin carried her back to the royal palace , and laid her in her bed.
Next morning when the princess arose , she went to her father , and told him that she had had a very strange dream.
`` I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning ,"
It was only a dream , and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything"
`` The dream may have been true ,"
said the King , `` I will give thee a piece of advice.
But unseen by the King , the mannikin was standing beside him when he said that , and heard all.
And again the princess was compelled to do servant 's work until cock-crow.
`` We must think of something else ,"
`` Do what I bid thee ,"
Next morning the King had the entire town searched for his daughter 's shoe.
And now loaded with chains , he was standing at the window of his dungeon , when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by.
His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted.
As soon as the soldier was alone again , he lighted his pipe and summoned the black mannikin.
`` Have no fear ,"
said the latter to his master.
`` Go wheresoever they take you , and let them do what they will , only take the blue light with you"
Next day the soldier was tried , and though he had done nothing wicked , the judge condemned him to death.
When he was led forth to die , he begged a last favor of the King.
`` What is it ?"
asked the King.
`` That I may smoke one more pipe on my way"
`` Thou mayst smoke three ,"
answered the King , `` but do not imagine that I will spare thy life"
`` Strike down to earth that false judge there , and his constable , and spare not the King who has treated me so ill"
Then the little dogs said , `` No , no , we will not go.
If the mistress gets to know it , she will beat us"
The countryman said , `` She will know nothing about it.
Do come ; after all , she never gives you anything good"
Then the little dogs again said , `` Nay , nay , we must let it alone ; we must not go"
But at that very moment the mistress came , and seized the stick in great haste , and beat them and treated them very hardly.
And when they were outside the house , the little dogs said to the countryman , `` Dost , dost , dost , dost , dost thou see ?"
Then the countryman laughed and said , `` Did n't , did n't , did n't , you expect it ?"
So they just had to run away"
The shepherd told all this to his mother , who said , `` Take the third for thy wife"
This he did , and lived contentedly and happily with her"
Now , evaporated apples are nothing more or less than dried apples.
The cook of the loggers ' camp used them to make apple pies.
And first , before making his pies , he always soaked them in water so they would swell.
Now you see what made person_0 Coon feel so queer and uncomfortable.
He had first eaten his dried apples.
And then he had soaked them , by drinking out of the brook.
In fact , the wonder of it was that he was able to get through his mother 's doorway , when he reached home.
But he did it , though it cost him a few groans.
And he frightened his mother , too.
`` I only hope you 're not poisoned ,"
she said , when person_0 told her what he had been doing.
And that remark frightened person_0 more than ever.
He was sure he was never going to feel any better.
Poor Mrs.
Coon was much worried all the rest of the night.
But when morning came she knew that person_0 was out of danger.
She knew it because of something he said.
It was this : `` Oh , dear ! I wish I had something to eat !"
Once on a time a poor pious peasant died , and arrived before the gate of heaven.
At the same time a very rich , rich lord came there who also wanted to get into heaven.
At length all became quiet again , and Saint Peter came and opened the gate of heaven , and let the peasant in.
Wandering through the woods one day , Fatty Coon 's bright eyes caught a strange gleam from something -- something that shone and glittered out of the green.
Fatty wanted to see what it was , though he hardly thought it was anything to eat.
But whenever he came upon something new he always wanted to examine it.
So now Fatty hurried to see what the strange thing was.
Fatty Coon looked carefully at the bright thing.
He walked all around it , so he could see it from all sides.
And at last he thought he knew what it was.
He saw nothing strange in that ; for he knew that the moon often touched the earth.
`` Oh ! the moon ! the moon !"
Fatty shouted.
He had run so fast that , being so plump , he was quite out of breath.
And that was all he could say.
`` Well , well ! What about the moon !"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
`` Anybody would think you had found it , almost"
And she smiled.
Fatty puffed and gasped.
And at last he caught his breath again.
`` Yes -- I 've found it ! It 's over in the woods -- just a little way from here !"
he said.
`` Big , and round , and shiny ! Let 's all go and bring it home !"
`` Well , well , well !"
Mrs.
Coon was puzzled.
She had never heard of the moon being found in those woods ; and she hardly knew what to think.
`` Are you sure ?"
she asked.
`` Oh , yes , Mother !"
Fatty could hardly wait , he was so eager to lead the way.
And with many a shake of the head , Mrs.
Coon , with her family , started off to see the moon.
`` There !"
Fatty cried , as they came in sight of the bright , round thing.
`` There it is -- just as I told you !"
And they all set up a great shouting.
All but Mrs.
Coon.
She was n't quite sure , even yet , that Fatty had really found the moon.
And she walked close to the shining thing and peered at it.
But not too close ! Mrs.
Coon did n't go too near it.
And she told her children quite sternly to stand back.
It was well that she did ; for when Mrs.
A trap ! THAT was what Mrs.
Coon saw right in front of her.
Yes -- it was a mercy that Fatty had n't begun knocking it about.
For if he had he would have stepped right into the trap and it would have shut -- SNAP ! Just like that.
And there he would have been , caught fast.
It was no wonder that Mrs.
Coon hurried her family away from that spot.
And Fatty led them all home again.
He could n't get away from his moon fast enough"
Then the wolf answered , `` If I had but the chance of seeing a man for once , I would set on him notwithstanding"
`` I can help thee to do that ,"
said the fox.
`` Come to me early to-morrow morning , and I will show thee one"
The wolf presented himself betimes , and the fox took him out on the road by which the huntsmen went daily.
First came an old discharged soldier.
`` Is that a man ?"
inquired the wolf.
`` No ,"
answered the fox , `` that was one"
Afterwards came a little boy who was going to school.
`` Is that a man ?"
`` No , that is going to be one"
At length came a hunter with his double-barrelled gun at his back , and hanger by his side.
Said the fox to the wolf , `` Look , there comes a man , thou must attack him , but I will take myself off to my hole"
The wolf then rushed on the man.
When the huntsman saw him he said , `` It is a pity that I have not loaded with a bullet ,"
aimed , and fired his small shot in his face.
`` Well , brother wolf ,"
said the fox , `` how hast thou got on with man ?"
`` Ah !"
`` See what a braggart thou art !"
said the fox.
`` Thou throwest thy hatchet so far that thou canst not fetch it back again !"
He took it home , therefore , and the two children grew up together.
The one , however , which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel , because a bird had carried it away.
Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they were sad.
Lina saw this and said , `` Hark you , old Sanna , why are you fetching so much water ?"
`` If thou wilt never repeat it to anyone , I will tell thee why"
Betimes next morning the forester got up and went out hunting , and when he was gone the children were still in bed.
Then Lina said to Fundevogel , `` If thou wilt never leave me , I too will never leave thee"
Fundevogel said , `` Neither now , nor ever will I leave thee"
Then said Lina , `` Then I will tell thee.
The two children therefore got up , dressed themselves quickly , and went away.
When the water in the kettle was boiling , the cook went into the bed-room to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it.
But when she came in , and went to the beds , both the children were gone.
Then the cook sent three servants after them , who were to run and overtake the children.
Fundevogel said , `` Neither now , nor ever"
Then said Lina , `` Do thou become a rose-tree , and I the rose upon it"
When the three servants came to the forest , nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it , but the children were nowhere.
Then said they , `` There is nothing to be done here ,"
and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it.
They had therefore to go out and look for the second time.
The children , however , saw them coming from a distance.
Then Lina said , `` Fundevogel , never leave me , and I will never leave thee"
Fundevogel said , `` Neither now , nor ever"
Said Lina , `` Then do thou become a church , and I 'll be the chandelier in it"
So when the three servants came , nothing was there but a church , with a chandelier in it.
They said therefore to each other , `` What can we do here , let us go home"
And now the old cook herself got on her legs , and went with the three servants in pursuit of the children.
The children , however , saw from afar that the three servants were coming , and the cook waddling after them.
Then said Lina , `` Fundevogel , never leave me , and I will never leave thee"
Then said Fundevogel , `` Neither now , nor ever"
Said Lina , `` Be a fishpond , and I will be the duck upon it"
Then the children went home together , and were heartily delighted , and if they are not dead , they are living still"
`` I will see to it , master ,"
answered Grethel.
The fowls began to turn brown , and were nearly ready , but the guest had not yet arrived.
The master said , `` I will run myself , and fetch the guest"
She ran down , set a jug , said , `` God bless it to thy use , Grethel ,"
and took a good drink , and took yet another hearty draught.
Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire , basted them , and drove the spit merrily round.
But as the roast meat smelt so good , Grethel thought , `` Something might be wrong , it ought to be tasted !"
When the two wings were eaten , she went and looked for her master , and did not see him.
It suddenly occurred to her , `` Who knows ? They are perhaps not coming at all , and have turned in somewhere"
So she ran into the cellar again , took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee.
So she took another hearty drink , and let the second chicken rejoin the first.
`` Yes , sir , I will soon serve up ,"
answered Grethel.
Presently the guest came , and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.
Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it !"
The guest heard the sharpening , and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could.
Grethel was not idle ; she ran screaming to her master , and cried , `` You have invited a fine guest !"
`` Eh , why , Grethel ? What do you mean by that ?"
`` Yes ,"
said she , `` he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up , off the dish , and has run away with them !"
`` That 's a nice trick !"
said her master , and lamented the fine chickens.
`` If he had but left me one , so that something remained for me to eat"
He called to him to stop , but the guest pretended not to hear.
Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand , crying , `` Just one , just one ,"
meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken , and not take both.
`` Thirty years ,"
replied God ; `` does that content thee ?"
`` Ah , Lord ,"
answered the ass , `` that is a long time.
Relieve me of a portion of this long time"
Then God had pity on him and relieved him of eighteen years.
The ass went away comforted , and the dog appeared.
`` How long wouldst thou like to live ?"
said God to him.
`` Thirty years are too many for the ass , but thou wilt be satisfied with that"
`` Lord ,"
God saw that he was right , and released him from twelve years of life.
Then came the monkey.
`` Thou wilt certainly live thirty years willingly ?"
said the Lord to him.
`` Thou hast no need to work as the ass and the dog have to do , and wilt always enjoy thyself"
`` Ah ! Lord ,"
he answered , `` it may seem as if that were the case , but it is quite different.
When it rains porridge I have no spoon.
God was gracious and took off ten.
At last man appeared , joyous , healthy and vigorous , and begged God to appoint his time for him.
`` Thirty years shalt thou live ,"
said the Lord.
`` Is that enough for thee ?"
`` What a short time ,"
`` I will add to it the ass 's eighteen years ,"
said God.
`` That is not enough ,"
replied the man.
`` Thou shalt also have the dog 's twelve years"
`` Still too little !"
`` Well , then ,"
said God , `` I will give thee the monkey 's ten years also , but more thou shalt not have"
The man went away , but was not satisfied.
So man lives seventy years.
Then man is weak-headed and foolish , does silly things , and becomes the jest of the children"
Then there was one who loved the King 's daughter , and he asked the King if he might have her.
`` Yes ,"
said the King ; `` if you can cross the mountain without falling , you shall have her"
And the princess said she would go over it with him , and would hold him if he were about to fall.
Meanwhile the King 's daughter had fallen quite deep down into the earth into a great cave.
So she did all he bade her.
When Old Rinkrank came home , he knocked at his door , and cried , `` Mother Mansrot , open the door for me"
`` No ,"
said she , `` Old Rinkrank , I will not open the door for thee"
`` I have washed thy dishes already ,"
said she.
`` I have made thy bed already ,"
said she.
He tried to peep in , but could not get his head through because of his long beard.
Then he began to cry most piteously , for it hurt him very much , and to entreat her to release him again.
But she said not until he gave her the ladder with which he ascended the mountain.
Then , whether he would or not , he had to tell her where the ladder was.
She went to her father , and told him all that had happened to her.
Then the King had Old Rinkrank put to death , and took all his gold and silver.
The princess married her betrothed , and lived right happily in great magnificence and joy"
`` If that is all ,"
said the man , `` then I will go into the forest , and get some wood for making reels"
The man listened , laid down his axe for a moment , and began to consider what that could mean.
`` Hollo ,"
he said at last , `` what can that have been ; my ears must have been singing , I wo n't alarm myself for nothing"
He stopped , and felt afraid and alarmed , and pondered over the circumstance.
That was enough for him , and all inclination had departed from him , so he hastily descended the tree , and set out on his way home.
The woman ran as fast as she could by by-ways so as to get home first.
`` No ,"
said he , `` I see very well that winding wo n't do ,"
and told her what had happened to him in the forest , and from that time forth left her in peace about it.
Neverthless after some time , the man again began to complain of the disorder in the house.
`` Wife ,"
said he , `` it is really a shame that the spun yarn should lie there all entangled !"
`` I 'll tell you what ,"
`` Yes , that will do ,"
said the man.
So they did that , and when it was done , he said , `` The yarn is in skeins , now it must be boiled"
The woman was again distressed ; She certainly said , `` Yes , we will boil it next morning early"
but she was secretly contriving another trick.
The man was willing and took good care not to loiter.
He got up as quickly as he could , and went into the kitchen.
But when he reached the kettle and peeped in , he saw , to his horror , nothing but a lump of tow.
But you yourself must own she was an odious woman !"
All perished together except the girl , who had jumped out of the carriage in a fright , and hidden herself behind a tree.
When the robbers had gone away with their booty , she came out and beheld the great disaster.
She walked about and looked for a road , but could find none.
When , however , she had sat there for a while , a white dove came flying to her with a little golden key in its mouth.
So she opened it , and found a beautiful white bed , and she prayed God to protect her during the night , and lay down and slept.
And when she opened it , she found garments beset with gold and with jewels , more splendid than those of any king 's daughter.
Once , however , the dove came and said , `` Wilt thou do something for my sake ?"
`` With all my heart ,"
said the girl.
The girl went to the little house , and came to the door.
There sat an old woman who stared when she saw her , and said , `` Good-day my child"
The girl gave her no answer , and opened the door.
`` Whither away ,"
But the girl was silent , got away from her , and went straight into the room.
Now there lay on the table an enormous quantity of rings , which gleamed and glittered before her eyes.
She turned them over and looked for the plain one , but could not find it.
Then his servants and his horses , who had likewise been changed into trees , were freed from the enchantment also , and stood beside him.
And he led them forth to his kingdom , for he was a King 's son , and they married , and lived happily"
My inclination to trade revived.
I bought goods suited to the commerce I intended , and put to sea a second time , with merchants of known probity.
We embarked on board a good ship , and after recommending ourselves to God , set sail.
We traded from island to island , and exchanged commodities with great profit.
We went to take a little fresh air in the meadows , and along the streams that watered them.
I made a very good meal , and afterwards fell asleep.
I can not tell how long I slept , but when I awoke the ship was gone.
I was very much surprised to find the ship gone.
I got up and looked about everywhere , and could not see one of the merchants who landed with me.
At last I perceived the ship under sail , but at such a distance that I lost sight of her in a very little time.
I leave you to guess at my melancholy reflections in this sad condition.
I upbraided myself a hundred times for not being content with the produce of my first voyage , that might well have served me all my life.
But all this was in vain , and my repentance out of season.
It was at least fifty paces round.
In short , the bird lighted , and sat over the egg to hatch it.
As I walked through this valley I perceived it was strewn with diamonds , some of which were of surprising bigness.
I spent the day in walking about the valley , resting myself at times in such places as I thought most suitable.
When night came on I went into a cave , where I thought I might be in safety.
When day appeared the serpents retired , and I came out of the cave trembling.
I can justly say that I walked a long time upon diamonds without feeling an inclination to touch any of them.
This was a great piece of fresh meat , and at the same time I saw several others fall down from the rocks in different places.
And this stratagem they make use of to get the diamonds out of the valley , which is surrounded with such precipices that nobody can enter it.
I had scarcely laid me down before the eagles came.
` You will treat me , ' replied I , ` with more civility when you know me better.
Do not trouble yourself ; I have diamonds enough for you and myself too , more than all the other merchants together.
Yet they did not so much admire my stratagem to save myself as my courage to attempt it.
I could not moderate my joy when I found myself delivered from the danger I have mentioned.
I thought I was in a dream , and could scarcely believe myself to be out of danger.
We took ship at the nearest port and came to the Isle of Roha , where the trees grow that yield camphor.
This tree is so large , and its branches so thick , that a hundred men may easily sit under its shade.
Here I exchanged some of my diamonds for good merchandise.
There I immediately gave great alms to the poor , and lived honourably upon the vast riches I had gained with so much fatigue"
My father left me the best inheritance ; to wit -- good humor.
And who was my father ? Why , that has nothing to do with the humor.
He was lively and stout , round and fat ; and his outer and inner man were in direct contradiction to his calling.
He had to go first before the bishop even , and before the princes of the blood.
The face said , `` It does n't matter , it does n't matter ; it will be better than one thinks"
I am not quite young.
It is very useful , and contains everything that a man needs to know -- such as who preaches in the church and in the new books.
Certainly , one may live merrily and be contentedly buried if one takes in the _ Intelligencer _.
The newspaper and my walk to the churchyard were always my most exciting occupations -- they were like bathing-places for my good humor.
The newspaper every one can read for himself.
But please come with me to the churchyard ; let us wander there where the sun shines and the trees grow green.
I heard it from my father , or found it out myself.
Now we are in the churchyard.
As if that was of any consequence.
Then sometimes the public applauded too much to suit his taste , and sometimes too little.
`` They 're like wet wood this evening ,"
he would say ; `` they wo n't kindle at all !"
Here rests a very happy man.
That is to say , a very grand man.
Everything is so nicely managed , it 's enough to put one into a good humor.
-LRB- Illustration : THE CHURCHYARD NARRATION.
Nobody derived any benefit from it , and no one even heard what the good thing was.
Why , then the good thing would not suit the time , and the man must carry his good idea down with him again.
What an unhappy man he must be ! Here rests a remarkably stingy woman.
Here is a maiden of another kind.
When the canary bird of the heart begins to chirp , reason puts her fingers in her ears.
The maiden was going to be married , but -- well , it 's an every-day story , and we will let the dead rest.
Here sleeps a widow who carried melody in her mouth and gall in her heart.
Here 's a family sepulchre.
they declared his opinion to be the only true one , because he belonged to the family.
The great poet Goethe concludes his `` Faust"
with the words `` may be continued ;"
and our wanderings in the churchyard may be continued too.
I inscribe their life and their deeds , looked at in my fashion , in my record ; and that 's what all people ought to do.
And that 's my story"
There was once on a time an old king who was ill , and thought to himself , `` I am lying on what must be my death-bed"
Then said he , `` Tell Faithful John to come to me"
Faithful John was his favorite servant , and was so called , because he had for his whole life long been so true to him.
He is still of tender age , and can not always know how to guide himself.
Then answered Faithful John , `` I will not forsake him , and will serve him with fidelity , even if it should cost me my life"
On this , the old person_0 said , `` Now I die in comfort and peace"
When the mourning was over , Faithful John said to him , `` It is now time that thou shouldst see thine inheritance.
I will show thee thy father 's palace"
`` There is something within it ,"
he replied , `` which would terrify thee"
But the person_0 answered , `` I have seen all the palace , and I will know what is in this room also ,"
and he went and tried to break open the door by force.
`` Ah , no ,"
replied the young person_0 , `` if I do not go in , it will be my certain destruction.
I should have no rest day or night until I had seen it with my own eyes.
I shall not leave the place now until thou hast unlocked the door"
Then he strengthened him with wine , until he came to himself again.
The first words the person_0 said were , `` Ah , the beautiful portrait ! whose it it ?"
`` That is the princess of the Golden Dwelling ,"
answered Faithful John.
I will give my life to win her.
Thou art my most Faithful John , thou must help me"
Then they sailed across the sea , and sailed on until they came to the town wherein dwelt the princess of the Golden Dwelling.
Faithful John bade the person_0 stay behind on the ship , and wait for him.
`` Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me ,"
said he , `` therefore see that everything is in order ; have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated"
Then he gathered together in his apron all kinds of gold things , went on shore and walked straight to the royal palace.
And when she was just turning round to carry away the sparkling water she saw the stranger , and asked who he was.
So he answered , `` I am a merchant ,"
and opened his apron , and let her look in.
Then she cried , `` Oh , what beautiful gold things !"
and put her pails down and looked at the golden wares one after the other.
Then said the girl , `` The princess must see these , she has such great pleasure in golden things , that she will buy all you have"
She took him by the hand and led him upstairs , for she was the waiting-maid.
But Faithful John said , `` I am only the servant of a rich merchant.
The things I have here are not to be compared with those my master has in his ship.
They are the most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in gold"
Then she got into the ship , and the person_0 led her within.
Within , however , the person_0 showed her the golden vessels , every one of them , also the wild beasts and strange animals.
Many hours went by whilst she was seeing everything , and in her delight she did not observe that the ship was sailing away.
`` Ah ,"
The person_0 , however , seized her hand , and said , `` I am not a merchant.
The first time that I looked on thy portrait , I fell fainting to the ground"
On this he stopped playing and listened to what they were saying to each other , for that he well understood.
One cried , `` Oh , there he is carrying home the princess of the Golden Dwelling"
`` Yes ,"
replied the second , `` but he has not got her yet"
Said the third , `` But he has got her , she is sitting beside him in the ship"
Spake the second , `` But is there no escape ?"
But who knows that ? And whosoever does know it , and tells it to him , will be turned to stone from the toe to the knee"
Then said the second , `` I know more than that ; even if the horse be killed , the young person_0 will still not keep his bride.
Said the third , `` Is there no escape at all ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
`` But what avails that ?"
`` Whosoever knows it and tells it to him , half his body will become stone from the knee to the heart"
Then said the third , `` I know still more ; even if the bridal garment be burnt , the young person_0 will still not have his bride.
But if any one who knows that were to declare it , he would become stone from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot"
At length , however , he said to himself , `` I will save my master , even if it bring destruction on myself"
When therefore they came to shore , all happened as had been foretold by the ravens , and a magnificent chestnut horse sprang forward.
`` Good ,"
said the person_0 , `` he shall carry me to my palace ,"
The other attendants again began to murmur , and said , `` Behold , now he is even burning the person_0 's bridal garment !"
But the young person_0 said , `` Who knows what good he may have done , leave him alone , he is my most faithful John"
`` Yes ,"
answered the person_0 , `` it shall be granted unto thee"
Then said Faithful John , `` I am unjustly condemned , and have always been true to thee ,"
Then cried the person_0 , `` Oh , my most Faithful John.
Pardon , pardon -- bring him down"
But as Faithful John spoke the last word he had fallen down lifeless and become a stone.
Thereupon the person_0 and the Queen suffered great anguish , and the person_0 said , `` Ah , how ill I have requited great fidelity !"
and ordered the stone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom beside his bed.
And as often as he looked on it he wept and said , `` Ah , if I could bring thee to life again , my most faithful John"
Some time passed and the Queen bore twins , two sons who grew fast and were her delight.
Then the stone began to speak and said , `` Thou canst bring me to life again if thou wilt use for that purpose what is dearest to thee"
Then cried the person_0 , `` I will give everything I have in the world for thee"
And when he had smeared the stone with their blood , life returned to it , and Faithful John stood once more safe and healthy before him.
He said to the person_0 , `` Thy truth shall not go unrewarded ,"
Then the person_0 was full of joy , and when he saw the Queen coming he hid Faithful John and the two children in a great cupboard.
When she entered , he said to her , `` Hast thou been praying in the church ?"
`` Yes ,"
answered she , `` but I have constantly been thinking of Faithful John and what misfortune has befallen him through us"
The Queen turned pale , and her heart was full of terror , but she said , `` We owe it to him , for his great fidelity"
and told her how everything had occurred.
Then they dwelt together in much happiness until their death"
Once when the father was going out to plough , the little one said , `` Father , I will go out with you"
`` Thou wouldst go out with me ?"
said the father.
`` Stay here , thou wilt be of no use out there , besides thou mightest get lost !"
Then Thumbling began to cry , and for the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket , and took him with him.
When he was outside in the field , he took him out again , and set him in a freshly-cut furrow.
Whilst he was there , a great giant came over the hill.
`` Do thou see that great bogie ?"
said the father , for he wanted to frighten the little fellow to make him good ; `` he is coming to fetch thee"
The giant , however , had scarcely taken two steps with his long legs before he was in the furrow.
He took up little Thumbling carefully with two fingers , examined him , and without saying one word went away with him.
The giant , however , carried him home , suckled him , and Thumbling grew and became tall and strong after the manner of giants.
Then the boy was already so strong that he tore up a young tree out of the earth by the roots.
But the giant thought , `` We must do better than that ,"
took him back again , and suckled him two years longer.
When he tried him , his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground.
the boy tore up the strongest oak-tree from the earth , so that it split , and that was a mere trifle to him.
`` Now that will do ,"
said the giant , `` thou art perfect ,"
and took him back to the field from whence he had brought him.
His father was there following the plough.
The young giant went up to him , and said , `` Does my father see what a fine man his son has grown into ?"
The farmer was alarmed , and said , `` No , thou art not my son ; I do n't want thee leave me !"
`` Truly I am your son ; allow me to do your work , I can plough as well as you , nay better"
`` No , no , thou art not my son ; and thou canst not plough go away !"
When he entered the yard , his mother did not recognize him , and asked , `` Who is that horrible tall man ?"
The farmer said , `` That is our son"
She said , `` No that can not be our son , we never had such a tall one , ours was a little thing"
She called to him , `` Go away , we do not want thee !"
The youth was silent , but led his horses to the stable , gave them some oats and hay , and all that they wanted.
Then she said , `` Yes ,"
and brought in two immense dishes full of food , which would have been enough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week.
The youth , however , ate the whole of it himself , and asked if she had nothing more to set before him.
`` No ,"
she replied , `` that is all we have"
`` But that was only a taste , I must have more"
`` At length come a few crumbs ,"
said he , and ate all there was , but it was still not sufficient to appease his hunger.
The youth laid it across his knees , and snap ! he broke it in two in the middle like a bean-stalk , and threw it away.
The father then harnessed four horses , and brought a bar which was so long and thick , that the four horses could only just drag it.
So the father harnessed eight horses , and brought one which was so long and thick , that the eight horses could only just carry it.
So he went away , and gave out that he was a smith 's apprentice.
The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman.
`` Yes ,"
said the smith , and looked at him , and thought , `` That is a strong fellow who will strike out well , and earn his bread"
So he asked , `` How much wages dost thou want ?"
`` I do n't want any at all ,"
he replied , `` only every fortnight , when the other journeymen are paid , I will give thee two blows , and thou must bear them"
The miser was heartily satisfied , and thought he would thus save much money.
Then said he , `` I will only give you quite a small blow , that 's all"
And he raised his foot , and gave him such a kick that he flew away over four loads of hay.
Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in the smithy for himself , took it as a stick in his hand and went onwards.
When he had walked for some time , he came to a small farm , and asked the bailiff if he did not require a head-servant.
`` Yes ,"
He again replied that he wanted no wages at all , but that every year he would give him three blows , which he must bear.
Then the bailiff was satisfied , for he , too , was a covetous fellow.
Next morning all the servants were to go into the wood , and the others were already up , but the head-servant was still in bed.
Then one of them called to him , `` Get up , it is time ; we are going into the wood , and thou must go with us"
`` Ah ,"
said he quite roughly and surlily , `` you may just go , then ; I shall be back again before any of you"
The bailiff said they were to awaken him again , and tell him to harness the horses.
The head-man , however , said as before , `` Just go there , I shall be back again before any of you"
And then he stayed in bed two hours longer.
When he came to the barricade , the others were still standing there , not able to get through.
`` Do n't you see ,"
When he was over , he said to the others , `` There , you see , I have got over quicker than you ,"
and drove on , and the others had to stay where they were.
Then said the bailiff to his wife , `` The servant is a good one , if he does sleep long , he is still home before the others"
`` No ,"
said he , `` I will not be a bailiff , I am head-servant , and will remain so , but I will administer that which we agreed on"
The bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he demanded , but it was of no use , the head-servant said no to everything.
Then the bailiff did not know what to do , and begged for a fortnight 's delay , for he wanted to find some way of escape.
The head-servant consented to this delay.
The bailiff summoned all his clerks together , and they were to think the matter over , and give him advice.
The advice pleased the bailiff , and the head-servant was quite willing to go down the well.
So the bailiff cried , `` Sh-sh ,"
and pretended to frighten the hens away.
When the head-servant had finished his work , he climbed up and said , `` Just look what a beautiful neck-tie I have on ,"
and behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing round his neck.
The head-servant now wanted to take his reward , but the bailiff again begged for a fortnight 's delay.
He said , `` I will manage it , just you go away to bed"
Then he went into the mill , and poured out the corn.
About eleven o'clock he went into the miller 's room , and sat down on the bench.
Then he said , `` If anything of that kind comes again , I shall strike out in return"
And when he had received a second box on the ear , he , too struck out.
And so it continued the whole night.
He took nothing without returning it , but repaid everything with interest , and did not lay about him in vain.
At daybreak , however , everything ceased.
When the miller had got up , he wanted to look after him , and wondered if he were still alive.
Then the youth said , `` I have eaten my fill , have received some boxes on the ears , but I have given some in return"
The miller rejoiced , and said that the mill was now released from the spell , and wanted to give him much money as a reward.
But he said , `` Money , I will not have , I have enough of it"
Then said the head-servant to the bailiff 's wife , `` If he does not come back , you must take the other blow"
She cried , `` No , no I can not bear it ,"
and opened the other window , because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead.
Then he gave her such a kick that she , too , flew out , and as she was lighter she went much higher than her husband.
Her husband cried , `` Do come to me ,"
but she replied , `` Come thou to me , I can not come to thee"
The master answered , `` You have served me faithfully and honestly ; as the service was so shall the reward be ;"
and he gave person_0 a piece of gold as big as his head.
As he went on , always putting one foot before the other , he saw a horseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse.
`` Ah !"
The rider , who had heard him , stopped and called out , `` Hollo ! person_0 , why do you go on foot , then ?"
`` I must ,"
`` I will tell you what ,"
said the rider , `` we will exchange : I will give you my horse , and you can give me your lump"
`` With all my heart ,"
said person_0 , `` but I can tell you , you will have to crawl along with it"
person_0 was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free.
Never again will I mount it.
What would I not give to have such a cow"
`` Well ,"
said the countryman , `` if it would give you so much pleasure , I do not mind giving the cow for the horse"
person_0 agreed with the greatest delight ; the countryman jumped upon the horse , and rode quickly away.
person_0 drove his cow quietly before him , and thought over his lucky bargain.
Good heart , what more can I want ?"
Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother 's village.
As it drew nearer mid-day , the heat was more oppressive , and person_0 found himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross.
He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst.
`` I can find a cure for this ,"
thought person_0 ; `` I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk"
By good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a wheel-barrow , in which lay a young pig.
`` What sort of a trick is this ?"
cried he , and helped the good person_0 up.
person_0 told him what had happened.
The butcher gave him his flask and said , `` Take a drink and refresh yourself.
The cow will certainly give no milk , it is an old beast ; at the best it is only fit for the plough , or for the butcher"
`` Well , well ,"
A young pig like that now is the thing to have , it tastes quite different ; and then there are the sausages !"
`` Hark ye , person_0 ,"
said the butcher , `` out of love for you I will exchange , and will let you have the pig for the cow"
`` Heaven repay you for your kindness !"
Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm.
They said good morning to each other , and person_0 began to tell of his good luck , and how he had always made such good bargains.
The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a christening-feast.
`` Just lift her ,"
added he , and laid hold of her by the wings ; `` how heavy she is -- she has been fattened up for the last eight weeks.
Whoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will have to wipe the fat from both sides of his mouth"
`` Yes ,"
said person_0 , as he weighed her in one hand , `` she is a good weight , but my pig is no bad one"
Meanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other , and shook his head.
`` Look here ,"
he said at length , `` it may not be all right with your pig.
In the village through which I passed , the Mayor himself had just had one stolen out of its sty.
I fear -- I fear that you have got hold of it there.
The good person_0 was terrified.
`` Goodness !"
he said , `` help me out of this fix ; you know more about this place than I do , take my pig and leave me your goose"
`` I shall risk something at that game ,"
answered the lad , `` but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble"
So he took the cord in his hand , and drove away the pig quickly along a by-path.
The good person_0 , free from care , went homewards with the goose under his arm.
`` When I think over it properly ,"
How glad my mother will be !"
`` Yes ,"
answered the scissors-grinder , `` the trade has a golden foundation.
A real grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket finds gold in it.
But where did you buy that fine goose ?"
`` I did not buy it , but exchanged my pig for it"
`` And the pig ?"
`` That I got for a cow"
`` And the cow ?"
`` I took that instead of a horse"
`` And the horse ?"
`` For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head"
`` And the gold ?"
`` Well , that was my wages for seven years ' service"
`` You have known how to look after yourself each time ,"
said the grinder.
`` If you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in your pocket whenever you stand up , you will have made your fortune"
`` How shall I manage that ?"
said person_0.
`` You must be a grinder , as I am ; nothing particular is wanted for it but a grindstone , the rest finds itself.
`` How can you ask ?"
answered person_0.
and he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange.
`` Now ,"
Take it with you and keep it carefully"
person_0 loaded himself with the stones , and went on with a contented heart ; his eyes shone with joy.
`` I must have been born with a caul ,"
he cried ; `` everything I want happens to me just as if I were a Sunday-child"
Meanwhile , as he had been on his legs since daybreak , he began to feel tired.
Then he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry them just then.
`` There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I ,"
he cried out.
With a light heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was with his mother at home"
And , indeed , he declared he was the happiest man ; I heard it out of his own mouth.
He was a Dane , a traveling theater director.
He had all his company with him in a large box , for he was proprietor of a puppet-show.
His inborn cheerfulness , he said , had been _ purified _ by a Polytechnic candidate , and the experiment had made him completely happy.
I did not at first understand all this , but afterwards he explained the whole story to me , and here it is.
He told me : -LRB- Illustration : THE ANIMATED PUPPETS.
Punctually at eight o'clock my performance closed ; for children must go early to bed , and a manager must consult the convenience of his public.
At nine o'clock the candidate commenced his lecture , with experiments , and now I formed part of _ his _ audience.
It was wonderful to hear and to see.
All night long I could not go to sleep.
And the next evening , when I gave another performance , and the candidate was again present , I felt fairly overflowing with humor.
But I had the best of it , for there was much in what he did of which he could not always give me an explanation.
For instance , that a piece of iron that falls through a spiral should become magnetic.
` One of the happiest ! ' said the candidate , and he seemed to take real pleasure in it.
There was some magic in it , or I should certainly have become tipsy.
We drank to my success and clinked our glasses.
He packed all my dolls into a box , bound the box on my back , and then let me fall through a spiral.
The spirit had come upon all of us : all the puppets had become distinguished artists , so they said themselves , and I was the director.
All was ready for the first representation ; the whole company wanted to speak to me , and the public also.
The lady who acted the queen wished to be treated off the stage as a queen , or else she should get out of practice.
The hero would only play parts composed of nothing but points ; for those brought him down the applause.
The prima donna would only play in a red light ; for she declared that a blue one did not suit her complexion.
It was like a company of flies in a bottle ; and I was in the bottle with them , for I was the director.
My breath stopped and my head whirled round ; I was as miserable as a man can be.
It was quite a novel kind of men among whom I now found myself.
` Now you 'll just have to stay there , ' said I , ` and I shall beware how I wish you flesh and blood again.
' I felt quite light , my good humor had come back , and I was the happiest of mortals.
The Polytechnic student had fully purified me.
I sat as happy as a king , and went to sleep on the box.
I am a happy director : none of my company ever grumble , nor my public either , for they are always merry.
I can put my pieces together just as I please.
I take out of every comedy what pleases me best , and no one is angry at it.
On this occasion I chose the general `` moving-day"
But this time I happened to see two children playing in this wilderness of sweepings.
They were playing at `` going to bed ,"
`` It was splendid !"
they said ; but it was a little too strong for me , and besides , I was obliged to mount up on my visit.
`` It 's moving-day to-day ,"
he said ; `` streets and houses are like a dust-bin , a large dust-bin ; but I 'm content with a cartload.
I may get something good out of that , and I really did get something good out of it , once.
The dustman was there with his cart , which was full , and looked like a sample of streets on moving-day.
` I 'm sorry for the tree , ' it thought ; ` and I was also at the feast , where the chandeliers glittered.
` That 's a stupid affair with yonder fir tree , ' said the potsherds.
You see , potsherds think everything is stupid.
` When one is in the dust-cart , ' they said , ` one ought not to give one 's self airs and wear tinsel.
I know that I have been useful in the world , far more useful than such a green stick.

aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` There are the good people below , playing at ` changing houses.
If he had been allowed to get in , he would have escaped the clutches of the poets.
`` Just cast your mind 's eye into that great omnibus.
If on the glasses there stood written ' _ oblivion _ , ' on the barrel ' _ remembrance _ ' is inscribed.
Thus too , there was a Louis XI.
I fancy that Death took , these two teeth out of the savings bank of life , and gave them to Louis XI.
Any day , any how , any minute , the omnibus may draw up.
Then says the mother to the daughter , `` Go into the garden , and chase the hare away"
The girl says to the little hare , `` Sh-sh , hare , you are still eating up all our cabbages"
Says the hare , `` Come , maiden , and seat yourself on my little hare 's tail , and come with me into my little hare 's hut"
The girl will not do it.
The girl says to the hare , `` Sh-sh , little hare , you are still eating all the cabbages"
The little hare says , `` Maiden , seat thyself on my little hare 's tail , and come with me into my little hare 's hut"
The maiden refuses.
The third day the hare comes again , and eats the cabbages.
On this the mother says to the daughter , `` Go into the garden , and hunt the hare away"
Says the maiden , `` Sh-sh , little hare , you are still eating all our cabbages"
Says the little hare , `` Come , maiden , seat thyself on my little hare 's tail , and come with me into my little hare 's hut"
Then all the wedding-guests assembled.
-LRB- Who were the wedding-guests ? -RRB- That I can tell you as another told it to me.
The girl , however , was sad , for she was all alone.
The little hare comes and says , `` Open the doors , open the doors , the wedding-guests are merry"
The bride says nothing , but weeps.
The little hare goes away.
The little hare comes back and says , `` Take off the lid , take off the lid , the wedding-guests are hungry"
The bride again says nothing , and weeps.
The little hare goes away.
The little hare comes back and says , `` Take off the lid , take off the lid , the wedding-guests are waiting"
The little hare comes once more and says , `` Take off the lid , take off the lid ,"
and gets up , and strikes the doll on the head so that her cap falls off.
Then the little hare sees that it is not his bride , and goes away and is sorrowful"
Then said the son , `` I will manage very well for myself ; I will always say , Not much , not much , not much"
So he walked for a long time and always said , `` Not much , not much , not much"
Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said , `` person_0 speed you ! not much , not much , not much"
`` What sayst thou churl , ` not much ?"
' And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish.
So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and said , `` Hast thou never seen me threshing ?"
`` What ought I to say , then ?"
asked the youth.
`` Thou must say , ` Get it full , get it full.
'"
After this he again walked a long time , and said , `` Get it full , get it full ,"
until he came to the gallows , where they had got a poor sinner whom they were about to hang.
Then said he , `` Good morning ; get it full , get it full"
And he again got some blows on his back.
`` What am I to say , then ?"
said he.
`` Thou must say , may person_0 have pity on the poor soul"
Again the youth walked on for a long while and said , `` May person_0 have pity on the poor soul !"
Then he came to a pit by which stood a knacker who was cutting up a horse.
The youth said , `` Good morning ; person_0 have pity on the poor soul !"
`` What dost thou say , thou ill-tempered knave ?"
and the knacker gave him such a box on the ear , that he could not see out of his eyes.
`` What am I to say , then ?"
`` Thou must say , ` There lies the carrion in the pit ! '"
So he walked on , and always said , `` There lies the carrion in the pit , there lies the carrion in the pit"
And he came to a cart full of people , so he said , `` Good morning , there lies the carrion in the pit !"
She was , however , good and pious.
And as she was thus forsaken by all the world , she went forth into the open country , trusting in the good God.
Then a poor man met her , who said , `` Ah , give me something to eat , I am so hungry !"
She reached him the whole of her piece of bread , and said , `` May God bless it to thy use ,"
and went onwards.
Then came a child who moaned and said , `` My head is so cold , give me something to cover it with"
Then she gave it her own ; and a little farther on one begged for a frock , and she gave away that also.
and took it off , and gave away that also.
Then she gathered together the money into this , and was rich all the days of her life"
People say that everything about her does look so strange , and that there are such odd things in her house , that I have become quite curious !"
But the maiden did not let herself be turned aside by her parent 's prohibition , and still went to Frau Trude.
And when she got to her , Frau Trude said , `` Why art thou so pale ?"
`` Ah ,"
she replied , and her whole body trembled , `` I have been so terrified at what I have seen"
`` What hast thou seen ?"
`` I saw a black man on your steps"
`` That was a collier"
`` Then I saw a green man"
`` That was a huntsman"
`` After that I saw a blood-red man"
`` That was a butcher"
`` Oho !"
said she , `` then thou hast seen the witch in her proper costume.
I have been waiting for thee , and wanting thee a long time already ; thou shalt give me some light"
Then she changed the girl into a block of wood , and threw it into the fire.
A father was one day sitting at dinner with his wife and his children , and a good friend who had come on a visit was with them.
It did not look around , and it did not speak ; but went straight into the next room.
Soon afterwards it came back , and went out at the door again in the same quiet manner.
On the second and on the third day , it came also exactly in the same way.
said he , neither did he know to whom it could belong.
On this the stranger got up , went to the room door , opened it a little , and peeped in.
The parents gave the money at once to a poor man , and after that the child was never seen again"
A louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer in an egg-shell.
Then the little louse fell in and burnt herself.
On this the little flea began to scream loudly.
Then said the little room-door , `` Little flea , why art thou screaming ?"
`` Because the louse has burnt herself"
Then the little door began to creak.
On this a little broom in the corner said , `` Why art thou creaking , little door ?"
`` Have I not reason to creak ?"
`` The little louse has burnt herself , The little flea is weeping"
So the little broom began to sweep frantically.
Then a little cart passed by and said , `` Why art thou sweeping , little broom ?"
`` Have I not reason to sweep ?"
`` The little louse has burnt herself , The little flea is weeping , The little door is creaking"
So the little cart said , `` Then I will run ,"
and began to run wildly.
Then said the ash-heap by which it ran , `` Why art thou running so , little cart ?"
`` Have I not reason to run ?"
`` The little louse has burnt herself , The little flea is weeping , The little door is creaking , The little broom is sweeping"
The ash-heap said , `` Then I will burn furiously ,"
and began to burn in clear flames.
A little tree stood near the ash-heap and said , `` Ash-heap , why art thou burning ?"
`` Have I not reason to burn ?"
The little tree said , `` Then I will shake myself ,"
`` Have I not reason to shake myself ?"
On this the girl said , `` Then I will break my little water-pitcher ,"
and she broke her little water-pitcher.
Then said the little spring from which ran the water , `` Girl , why art thou breaking thy water-jug ?"
`` Have I not reason to break my water-jug ?"
`` Oh , ho !"
said the spring , `` then I will begin to flow ,"
and began to flow violently.
One fine winter 's day person_0 Coon came upon the queerest tracks in the snow.
But these were six times as big as bear tracks.
And person_0 felt a shiver of fear run up and down his back.
He followed the trail a little way.
But he was very careful.
The great tracks led straight toward Farmer Green 's house.
And person_0 did not want to go there.
So he hurried home to ask his mother what he had found.
Mrs.
Coon listened to person_0 's story.
`` I think it must be the monster that almost caught me in the road last summer ,"
said person_0 , meaning the automobile that had given him a great fright.
`` Maybe he 's come back again to catch Farmer Green and his family.
Do you suppose he 's eaten them up ?"
Mrs.
Coon was puzzled.
And she was somewhat alarmed , too.
She wanted to see those strange tracks herself.
So she told her other children not to step a foot out of the house until she came back.
And then she asked person_0 to run along and show her where he had come upon the monster 's trail.
person_0 Coon felt very important , as he led the way across the swamp and into the woods.
It was not often that he could show his mother anything.
And he was so proud that he almost forgot his fright.
`` I guess you 're glad I have sharp eyes ,"
he said , as they hurried along.
`` If the tracks are as big as you say they are , your eyes would n't have to be very sharp to see them ,"
his mother told him.
Mrs.
Coon never liked to hear her children boast.
She knew that boasting is one of the most unpleasant things anyone can do.
`` Well -- maybe you do n't think I saw the monster 's tracks at all ,"
said person_0.
`` Maybe you do n't think I heard him screech --"
`` When did you hear him screech ?"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
`` This is the first you 've said about SCREECHING.
When was it ?"
`` Last summer ,"
person_0 answered.
Mrs.
Coon did n't smile.
Perhaps she was too worried for that.
`` It may not be the same monster ,"
she said.
`` It may not be a monster at all"
But by this time person_0 was sure he was right.
He was sure he knew more than his mother.
`` Why ca n't we go right over to Farmer Green 's and take some of his chickens ?"
he asked.
`` The monster has probably eaten him by this time , and all his family , too"
But Mrs.
Coon would do no such thing.
`` Show me the tracks ,"
she said firmly.
And so they went on into the woods.
`` There they are !"
person_0 cried , a few minutes later.
`` See , Mother ! They 're even bigger than I said"
He heard a funny noise behind him , then.
And when person_0 Coon looked around he saw that his mother was actually holding her sides , she was laughing so hard.
`` Those are Farmer Green 's tracks ,"
she said , as soon as she could stop laughing long enough to speak.
`` What -- as big as that ?"
person_0 pointed at the huge prints in the snow.
`` Snowshoes !"
Mrs.
Coon said.
`` He was wearing snowshoes -- great frames made of thongs and sticks , to keep him from sinking into the snow"
So that was all there was to person_0 's monster.
Somehow , he was disappointed.
But he was very glad he had said nothing to Jasper Jay about his strange animal.
For if he had , he knew he would never have heard the last of it.
And person_0 was glad about another thing , too.
He felt very happy that his mother had not let him go after Farmer Green 's chickens"
`` Oh , Mother ! What is it ?"
he cried.
`` The loggers have come ,"
Mrs.
Coon said.
`` They are cutting down all the big trees in the swamp"
`` Then we 'll have to move , wo n't we ?"
Fatty asked.
`` No ! They wo n't touch this tree ,"
his mother told him.
`` It 's an old tree , and hollow -- so they wo n't chop it down.
It 's only the good sound trees that they 'll take"
`` But I thought this was a good tree"
Fatty was puzzled.
`` So it is , my son ! It 's a good tree for us.
But not for the loggers.
They would have little use for it"
Fatty Coon felt better when he heard that.
And he had a good deal of fun , peeping down at the loggers and watching them work.
But he took care that they should not see HIM.
He knew what their bright axes could do.
When night came Fatty had still more fun.
When the loggers were asleep Fatty went to their camp in the woods beside the brook and he found many good things to eat.
He did not know the names of all the goodies ; but he ate them just the same.
He ` specially liked some potatoes which the careless cook had left in a pan near the open camp-fire.
The fire was out.
And the pan rested on a stump close beside it.
Fatty Coon climbed up and crawled right inside the pan.
Fatty had jumped to one side , when the tin pan fell.
It made a great clatter ; and he kept very still for a few moments , while he listened.
But no one stirred.
And then Fatty jumped plump into the ashes.
WHEW ! He jumped out again as fast as he could ; for beneath the ashes there were plenty of hot coals.
Fatty stood in them for not more than three seconds , but that was quite long enough.
The bottoms of his feet burned as if a hundred hornets had stung them.
He stood first on one foot and then on another.
If you could have seen him you would have thought Fatty was dancing.
And you might have laughed , because he looked funny.
But Fatty Coon did not laugh.
In fact , he came very near crying.
And he did not wait to eat another mouthful.
He limped along toward home.
And it was several days before he stirred out of his mother 's house again.
He just lay in his bed and waited until his burns were well again.
It was very hard.
For Fatty did not like to think of all those good things to eat that he was missing.
And he hoped the loggers would not go away before his feet were well again"
So one day he led his brother person_1 over to the old hollow sycamore.
His sisters , Fluffy and Cutey , wanted to go too.
But person_0 would not let them.
`` Girls ca n't be barbers ,"
he said.
And of course they could find no answer to that.
As soon as person_0 and person_1 reached the old sycamore I am sorry to say that a dispute arose.
Each of them wanted to use his own tail for the barber 's pole.
They could n't both stick their tails through the hole in the tree at the same time.
So they finally agreed to take turns.
Playing barber-shop was n't so much fun as they had expected , because nobody would come near to get his hair cut.
You see , the smaller forest - people were all afraid to go inside that old sycamore where person_0 and person_1 were.
There was no telling when the two brothers might get so hungry they would seize and eat a rabbit or a squirrel or a chipmunk.
And you know it is n't wise to run any such risk as that.
person_0 offered to cut person_1 's hair.
But person_1 remembered what his mother had said when person_0 came home with his moustache gone and his head all rough and uneven.
So person_1 would n't let person_0 touch him.
But HE offered to cut person_0 's hair -- what there was left of it.
`` No , thank you !"
said person_0.
`` I only get my hair cut once a month"
Of course , he had never had his hair cut except that once , in his whole life.
Now , since there was so little to do inside the hollow tree , person_0 and person_1 kept quarreling.
person_1 would no sooner stick his tail through the hole in the side of the tree than person_0 would want HIS turn.
And when person_0 had succeeded in squeezing HIS tail out through the opening person_1 would insist that person_0 's time was up.
It was person_0 's turn , and person_1 was shouting to him to stand aside and give him a chance.
`` I wo n't !"
said person_0.
`` I 'm going to stay here just as long as I please"
The words were hardly out of his mouth when he gave a sharp squeal , as if something hurt him.
And he tried to pull his tail out of the hole.
He wanted to get it out now.
But alas ! it would not come ! It was caught fast ! And the harder person_0 pulled the more it hurt him.
`` Go out and see what 's the matter !"
he cried to person_1.
But person_1 would n't stir.
He was afraid to leave the shelter of the hollow tree.
`` It may be a bear that has hold of your tail ,"
he told person_0.
And somehow , that idea made person_0 tremble all over.
`` Oh , dear ! oh , dear !"
he wailed.
`` What shall I do ? Oh ! whatever shall I do ?"
He began to cry.
And person_1 cried too.
How person_0 wished that his mother was there to tell him what to do ! But he knew of no way to fetch her.
Even if she were at home she could never hear him calling from inside the tree.
So person_0 gave up all hope of her helping.
`` Please , Mr.
Bear , let go of my tail !"
he cried , when he could stand the pain no longer.
The only answer that came was a low growl , which frightened person_0 and person_1 more than ever.
And then , just as they both began to howl at the top of their voices person_0 's tail was suddenly freed.
He was pulling on it so hard that he fell all in a heap on the floor of the barber-shop.
And that surprised him.
But he was still more surprised when he heard his mother say -- `` Stop crying and come out -- both of you !"
person_0 and person_1 scrambled out of the hollow sycamore.
person_0 looked all around.
But there was no bear to be seen anywhere -- no one but his mother.
`` Did you frighten the bear away , Mother ?"
he asked.
`` There was no bear ,"
Mrs.
Coon told him.
`` And it 's lucky for you that there was n't.
I saw your tail sticking out of this tree and I thought I would teach you a lesson.
Now , do n't ever do such a foolish thing again.
Just think what a fix you would have been in if Johnnie Green had come along.
He could have caught you just as easily as anything"
person_0 Coon was so glad to be free once more that he promised to be good forever after.
And he was just as good as any little coon could be -- all the rest of that day"
One night person_0 Coon was strolling along the road that wound through the valley.
The night was dark and though it was not very late , all the country people seemed to be in bed.
There were no farmers driving along the road.
person_0 had it all to himself.
And so he walked slowly homewards.
It was then that the terrible monster almost caught him.
This is how it all happened.
There was a br-br-br-r-r-r in the air.
person_0 really should have heard it long before he did.
But he had eaten so many apples that he had begun to feel sleepy ; and his ears were not so sharp as they should have been.
And when at last person_0 heard that br - r-r-r it was quite loud.
He was startled.
And he stopped right in the middle of the road to listen.
person_0 had never heard such a sound before.
The strange animal was on him before he knew it.
Its glaring eyes blinded him.
And if it had not screamed at him person_0 would never have escaped.
It was the terrible screech of the monster which finally made person_0 jump.
It was a frightful cry -- like six wildcats all wailing together.
And person_0 leaped to one side of the road just before the monster reached him.
The great creature went past person_0 like the wind and tore on up the hill.
He seemed to be running so fast that he could not stop.
person_0 could hear him panting as he climbed the sharp rise of the road.
person_0 Coon hurried away.
He wanted to get home before the monster could stop and come back to look for him.
When person_0 told his mother about his narrow escape Mrs.
Coon became much excited.
Mrs.
Coon and person_0 climbed to the very top of their old poplar and gazed down the valley.
`` Look , Mother !"
person_0 cried.
`` He 's stopped at Farmer Green 's ! You can see his eyes from here !"
Mrs.
Coon looked.
Sure enough ! It was just as person_0 said.
And that horrid call echoed across the valley once more.
Farmer Green stuck his head out of his chamber-window , to see what the man in the automobile wanted.
`` Where 's the nearest village , please ?"
the stranger asked.
And after Farmer Green had told him the man drove his car on again.
From their tree-top person_0 and his mother watched the monster dash down the valley.
They knew he had gone , because they could see the gleam of those awful eyes.
`` Do you suppose he ate up Farmer Green and his family ?"
person_0 asked in a frightened voice.
`` I hope so ,"
she said.
`` Then perhaps there 'll be no more traps in the woods"
`` But who would plant the corn ?"
person_0 asked.
Mrs.
Coon did not appear to hear his question"
Fatty Coon was so fat and round that he looked like a ball of fur , with a plumelike tail for a handle.
But if you looked at him closely you would have seen a pair of very bright eyes watching you.
Fatty loved to eat.
Yes -- he loved eating better than anything else in the world.
That was what made him so fat.
And that , too , was what led him into many adventures.
Among them all there was what grown people call `` a strong family resemblance ,"
which is the same thing as saying that they all looked very much alike.
The tail of each one of them -- mother and children too -- had six black rings around it.
Each of them had a dark brown patch of fur across the face , like a mask.
Coon , for she was so much bigger than her children.
And you would have known which was Fatty -- he was so much rounder than his brother and his sisters.
Mrs.
Coon 's home was in the hollow branch of an old tree.
It was a giant of a tree -- a poplar close by a brook which ran into the swamp -- and the branch which was Mrs.
Coon 's home was as big as most tree-trunks are.
Blackie was Fatty 's brother -- for the mask on his face was just a little darker than the others '.
Fluffy was one of Fatty 's sisters , because her fur was just a little fluffier than the other children 's.
And Cutey was the other sister 's name , because she was so quaint.
Now , Fatty Coon was forever looking around for something to eat.
He was never satisfied with what his mother brought home for him.
No matter how big a dinner Mrs.
Sometimes he went to the edge of the brook and tried to catch fish by hooking them out of the water with his sharp claws.
Sometimes he went over to the swamp and hunted for duck among the tall reeds.
He ate everything.
And he always wanted more.
`` Is this all there is ?"
Fatty Coon asked his mother one day.
He had gobbled up every bit of the nice fish that Mrs.
Coon had brought home for him.
It was gone in no time at all.
Mrs.
Coon sighed.
She had heard that question so many times ; and she wished that for once Fatty might have all the dinner he wanted.
`` Yes -- that 's all ,"
she said , `` and I should think that it was enough for a young coon like you"
Fatty said nothing more.
It made person_0 Coon feel sad , just to think that there was that field full of corn , and that he could never eat all of it.
But person_0 made up his mind that he would do the best he could.
He would visit the cornfield every night and feast on those sweet , tender kernels.
The very next night person_0 set out toward Farmer Green 's.
It was hardly dark.
But person_0 could not wait any longer.
He could not even wait for his mother and his sisters and his brother.
He hurried away alone.
And when he came in sight of the cornfield he felt better.
He had been the least bit afraid that the corn might be gone.
He thought that maybe Farmer Green had picked it , or that some of the forest people had eaten it all.
But there it was -- a forest of corn , waving and rustling in the moonlight as the breeze touched it.
person_0 felt very happy as he slipped through the rail-fence.
I would n't dare say how many ears of corn person_0 ate that night.
And he would have eaten more , too , if it had n't been for just one thing.
A dog barked.
And that spoiled person_0 's fun.
For the dog was altogether too near for person_0 to feel safe.
He even dropped the ear of corn he was gnawing and hurried toward the woods.
It was lucky for person_0 that he started when he did.
For that dog was close behind him in no time.
There was only one thing to do : person_0 knew that he must climb a tree at once.
So he made for the nearest tree in sight -- a big , spreading oak , which stood all alone just beyond the fence.
person_0 looked down at the dog and scolded a little.
He was not afraid.
But it made him cross to be driven out of the cornfield.
And he wished the dog would go away.
But the dog -- it was Farmer Green 's Spot -- the dog had no idea of leaving.
He stayed right there and barked so loudly that it was not long before Farmer Green and his hired man came in sight.
And with them was Johnnie Green and a little , young dog that had just been given to him.
When Farmer Green saw person_0 he seemed disappointed.
`` He 's too young to bother with ,"
he said.
`` His skin 's not worth much.
We 'll go ` long and see what we can find"
But Johnnie Green stayed behind.
He wanted that young coon.
And he intended to have him , too.
Leaving the young dog to watch person_0 Coon , Johnnie went back to the farmhouse.
After a while he appeared again with an axe over his shoulder.
And when he began to chop away at the big oak , person_0 Coon felt very uneasy.
Whenever Johnnie drove his axe into the tree , both the tree and person_0 shivered together.
And person_0 began to wish he had stayed away from the cornfield.
But not for long , because Johnnie Green soon gave up the idea of chopping down the big oak.
He looked up longingly at person_0 Coon.
And Johnnie started to climb the tree himself.
But the higher he climbed , the higher person_0 climbed.
And Johnnie knew that he could never catch that plump young coon in that way.
At last Johnnie Green started off , calling his dog after him.
And then person_0 Coon came down.
But he did not go back to the cornfield.
He decided that he had had adventures enough for one night.
But person_0 had learned something -- at least he thought he had.
For he made up his mind that once he climbed a tree , no man could reach him.
TREES COULD NOT BE CHOPPED DOWN ! That was what person_0 believed.
Perhaps you will know , later , whether person_0 ever found out that he was mistaken"
It was mid-summer when person_0 Coon had what he then believed to be the finest time in all his life.
Of course it was something to eat -- the surprise.
You must have guessed that , knowing person_0 Coon as you do.
`` Come , children !"
Mrs.
Coon said.
`` Come with me ! I 'm going to give you a treat -- something specially nice"
`` Is it something to eat ?"
person_0 asked , as they started off in the direction of Farmer Green 's fields.
`` Yes -- and the best thing you ever tasted ,"
Mrs.
Coon said.
person_0 was greatly excited.
His little bright eyes turned green in the moonlight.
He wondered what the surprise would be.
And , as usual , he was very hungry.
He walked close beside his mother , for he wanted to be the first to taste the surprise.
You would think that he would have wanted his two sisters to taste it first , and his brother Blackie , too.
But you must not forget that person_0 was greedy.
And greedy people are not thoughtful of others.
When Mrs.
Coon turned out of the lane and crawled through the fence , person_0 squeezed between the rails very nimbly , for him.
`` Here we are !"
said his mother.
person_0 looked about him.
They stood in a field grown high with tall stalks of some sort , which turned to green , ribbon-like leaves half way up from the ground.
person_0 grunted.
He was very impolite , you see.
`` Well -- what is there to eat that 's so fine ?"
he asked.
`` This stuff is n't good.
It 's like eating reeds"
He had already bitten into one of the stalks.
`` What do you call that ?"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
She showed person_0 a long roll of green that grew out of one of the stalks.
`` That 's something like a cattail ,"
said person_0.
`` It is n't good to eat"
`` Have you ever tried one ?"
asked his mother.
`` N -- no ,"
Patty said.
`` But Freddie Bluejay told me they were n't good"
`` He did , did he ?"
Mrs.
Coon said nothing more.
She stood up on her hind legs and pulled one of the tall stalks down until she could reach that long , green thing that grew there.
In a jiffy she had torn it from its stalk.
And then she stripped the green covering off it.
`` Try that !"
said Mrs.
Coon with a smile.
Of course it was person_0 who tasted it first.
He took a good mouthful of the white kernels , and he was overjoyed.
Such sweetness ! Such delicious , milky juice ! It was a moment that person_0 never forgot.
`` What 's its name , Mother ?"
he inquired.
`` Corn , my child"
`` Well , why does n't Freddie Bluejay like it ?"
person_0 asked.
`` He 's probably very fond of corn ,"
said Mrs.
Coon.
`` And I 've no doubt he was afraid that you would eat up this whole field , once you started"
`` I 'd like to ,"
said person_0 , with a sigh.
`` I 'd like to eat all the corn in the world"
He nosed about among the bushes and the tall grasses and caught a few bugs and a frog or two.
But he did n't think that THAT was much.
He did n't seem to have much luck , down on the ground.
So he climbed a tall hemlock , to see if he could find a squirrel 's nest , or some bird 's eggs.
Fatty loved to climb trees.
Up in the big hemlock he forgot , for a time , that he was still hungry.
It was delightful to feel the branches swaying under him , and the bright sunshine was warm upon his back.
He climbed almost to the very tip-top of the tree and wound himself around the straight stem.
The thick , springy branches held him safely , and soon Fatty was fast asleep.
Next to eating , Fatty loved sleeping.
And now he had a good nap.
Fatty Coon woke up at last , yawned , and slowly unwound himself from the stem of the tree.
He was terribly hungry now.
And he felt that he simply MUST find something to eat at once.
Pretty soon Fatty smiled.
He smiled because he was pleased.
And he was pleased because he saw exactly what he had been looking for.
Not far below him was a big nest , built of sticks and lined with bark and moss.
There were four white eggs in the nest -- the biggest crow 's eggs Fatty had ever seen.
And he began to eat them hungrily.
His nose became smeared with egg , but he did n't mind that at all.
He kept thinking how good the eggs tasted -- and how he wished there were more of them.
There was a sudden rush through the branches of the tall tree.
And Fatty Coon caught a hard blow on his head.
He felt something sharp sink into his back , too.
And he clutched at the edge of the nest to keep from falling.
Fatty was surprised , to say the least , for he had never known crows to fight like that.
And he was frightened , because his back hurt.
He could n't fight , because he was afraid he would fall if he let go of the nest.
There was nothing to do but run home as fast as he could.
Fatty tried to hurry ; but there was that bird , beating and clawing his back , and pulling him first one way and then another.
He began to think he would never reach home.
But at last he came to the old poplar where his mother lived.
He was glad , because he knew that no crow could follow him down there.
Mrs.
Coon waked up.
`` What on earth is the matter ?"
she exclaimed.
Poor Fatty told her.
He cried a little , because his back hurt him , and because he was so glad to be safe at home once more.
`` What color were those eggs ?"
Mrs.
Coon inquired.
`` White !"
said Fatty.
`` Ah , ha !"
Mrs.
Coon said.
`` Do n't you remember that crows ' eggs are a blueish green ? That must have been a goshawk 's nest.
And a goshawk is the fiercest of all the hawks there are.
It 's no wonder your back is clawed.
Come here and let me look at it"
Fatty Coon felt quite proud , as his mother examined the marks of the goshawk 's cruel claws.
And he did n't feel half as sorry for himself as you might think , for he remembered how good the eggs had tasted.
He only wished there had been a dozen of them"
For once Fatty Coon was not hungry.
He had eaten so much of Farmer Green 's corn that he felt as if he could not swallow another mouthful.
He was strolling homewards through the woods when someone called to him.
It was Jimmy person_0.
`` Where are you going , Fatty ?"
Jimmy person_0 asked.
`` Home !"
said Fatty.
`` Are you hungry ?"
Jimmy person_0 asked anxiously.
`` I should say not !"
Fatty answered.
`` I 've just had the finest meal I ever ate in my life"
Jimmy person_0 seemed to be relieved to hear that.
`` Come on over and play ,"
he said.
`` My brother and I are playing barber - shop over in the old sycamore tree ; and we need you"
`` All right !"
said Fatty.
`` What do you need me for ?"
Fatty asked , as he trudged along beside Jimmy person_0.
`` We need you for the barber 's pole ,"
Jimmy explained.
`` You can come inside the hollow tree and stick your tail out through a hole.
It will make a fine barber 's pole -- though the stripes DO run the wrong way , to be sure"
Fatty Coon was greatly pleased.
He looked around at his tail and felt very proud.
`` I 've got a beautiful tail -- have n't I ?"
he asked.
`` Um -- yes !"
Jimmy person_0 replied , `` though I must say it is n't one that I would care for myself.
But come along ! There may be people waiting to get their hair cut"
Sure enough ! When they reached the make-believe barber-shop there was a gray squirrel inside , and Jimmy person_0 's brother was busily snipping the fur off Mr.
Squirrel 's head.
`` How much do you charge for a hair-cut ?"
Fatty asked.
`` Oh , that depends !"
Jimmy person_0 said.
`` Mr.
Squirrel will pay us six cabbage leaves.
But if we were to cut your hair we 'd have to ask more.
We 'd want a dozen cabbage leaves , at least"
`` Well , do n't I get anything for the use of my tail ?"
Fatty asked.
He had already stuck it out through the hole ; and he had half a mind to pull it in again.
Jimmy person_0 and his brother whispered together for a few moments.
`` I 'll tell you what we 'll do ,"
Jimmy said.
`` If you 'll let us use your tail for the barber 's pole , we 'll cut your hair free.
Is n't that fair enough ?"
Fatty Coon was satisfied.
But he insisted that Jimmy begin to cut his hair at once.
`` I 'm doing my part of the work now ,"
he pointed out.
`` So there 's no reason why you should n't do yours"
With that Jimmy person_0 began.
He clipped and snipped at Fatty 's head , pausing now and then to see the effect.
He smiled once in a while , behind Fatty 's back , because Fatty certainly did look funny with his fur all ragged and uneven.
`` Moustache trimmed ?"
Jimmy person_0 asked , when he had finished with Fatty 's head.
`` Certainly -- of course !"
Fatty Coon answered.
And pretty soon Fatty 's long white moustache lay on the floor of the barber-shop.
Fatty felt a bit uneasy as he looked down and saw his beautiful moustache lying at his feet.
`` You have n't cut it too short , I hope ,"
he said.
`` No , indeed !"
Jimmy person_0 assured him.
`` It 's the very latest style"
`` What on earth has happened to you ?"
Mrs.
Coon cried , -- when Fatty reached home that night.
`` Have you been in a fire ?"
`` It 's the latest style , Mother ,"
Fatty told her.
`` At least , that 's what Jimmy person_0 says"
He felt the least bit uneasy again.
`` Did you let that Jimmy person_0 do that to you ?"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
Fatty hung his head.
He said nothing at all.
But his mother knew.
`` Well ! you ARE a sight !"
she exclaimed.
`` It will be months before you look like my child again.
I shall be ashamed to go anywhere with you"
Fatty Coon felt very foolish.
And there was just one thing that kept him from crying.
And THAT was THIS : he made up his mind that when he played barber-shop with Jimmy person_0 again he would get even with him.
But when the next day came , Fatty could n't find Jimmy person_0 and his brother anywhere.
They kept out of sight.
But they had told all the other forest-people about the trick they had played on Fatty Coon.
And everywhere Fatty went he heard nothing but hoots and jeers and laughs.
He felt very silly.
And he wished that he might meet Jimmy person_0 and his brother"
The winter was fast going.
person_0 was much thinner than he had been in the fall.
He had spent so much of the time sleeping that he had really eaten very little.
And now he hardly knew himself as he looked at his sides.
They no longer stuck out as they had once.
After nosing about the swamp and the woods all the afternoon person_0 decided that there was no use in trying to get a meal there.
The ground was covered with snow.
And except for rabbit tracks -- and a few squirrels ' -- he could find nothing that even suggested food.
And looking at those tracks only made him hungrier than ever.
For a few minutes person_0 thought deeply.
And then he turned about and went straight toward Farmer Green 's place.
He waited behind the fence just beyond Farmer Green 's house ; and when it began to grow dark he crept across the barnyard.
As person_0 passed a small , low building he noticed a delicious smell.
And he stopped right there.
He had gone far enough.
The door was open a little way.
And after one quick look all around -- to make sure there was nobody to see him -- person_0 slipped inside.
It was almost dark inside Farmer Green 's smokehouse -- for that was what the small , low building was called.
It was almost dark ; but person_0 could see just as well as you and I can see in the daytime.
There was a long row of hams hung up in a line.
Underneath them were white ashes , where Farmer Green had built wood fires , to smoke the hams.
But the fires were out , now ; and person_0 was in no danger of being burned.
The hams were what person_0 Coon had smelled.
And the hams were what person_0 intended to eat.
But when it came to eating , person_0 's courage never failed him.
He would have tried to eat an elephant , if he had had the chance.
person_0 did not stop to look long at that row of hams.
He climbed a post that ran up the side of the house and he crept out along the pole from which the hams were hung.
He stopped at the very first ham he came to.
There was no sense in going any further.
And person_0 dropped on top of the ham and in a twinkling he had torn off a big , delicious mouthful.
person_0 could not eat fast enough.
He wished he had two mouths -- he was so hungry.
But he did very well , with only ONE.
In no time at all he had made a great hole in the ham.
And he had no idea of stopping.
But he did stop.
He stopped very suddenly.
For the first thing he knew , something threw him right down upon the floor.
And the ham fell on top of him and nearly knocked him senseless.
He choked and spluttered ; for the ashes filled his mouth and his eyes , and his ears , too.
But he was terribly frightened.
And though his eyes smarted so he could hardly see , he sprang up and found the doorway.
person_0 swallowed a whole mouthful of ashes as he dashed across the barnyard.
And he never stopped running until he was almost home.
He was puzzled.
Try as he would , he could n't decide what it was that had flung him upon the floor.
`` It was some sort of trap , probably ,"
Mrs.
Coon said.
But for once Mrs.
Coon was mistaken.
It was very simple.
In his greedy haste person_0 had merely bitten through the cord that fastened the ham to the pole.
person_0 's children thought it very exciting.
It was their favorite story.
And they made their father tell it over and over again"
After his adventure with the goshawk Fatty Coon did not go near the tree-tops for a long time.
Somehow , he felt safer on the ground.
You see , he had n't forgotten the fright he had had , nor how the goshawk 's claws had hurt his back.
Fatty had been looking for frogs , but he had had no luck at all.
He wished he might find a frog.
But not one frog appeared.
Fatty began to think that some other coon must have visited the creek just before him and caught them all.
And then he forgot all about frogs.
Yes ! Frogs passed completely out of Fatty Coon 's mind.
For whom should he spy but Mrs.
Turtle ! He saw her little black head first , bobbing along through the water of the creek.
She was swimming toward the bank where Fatty was hidden.
And pretty soon she pulled herself out of the water and waddled a short distance along the sand at the edge of the creek.
Mrs.
Turtle stopped then ; and for a few minutes she was very busy about something.
First she dug a hole in the sand.
And Fatty wondered what she was looking for.
But he kept very quiet.
And after a time Mrs.
Turtle splashed into the creek again and paddled away.
But before she left she scooped sand into the hole she had dug.
Before she left the place she looked all around , as if to make sure that no one had seen her.
And as she waddled slowly to the water Fatty could see that she was smiling as if she was very well pleased about something.
She seemed to have a secret.
Fatty Coon had grown very curious , as he watched Mrs.
Turtle.
He went straight to the spot where Mrs.
Turtle had dug the hole and filled it up again.
And Fatty was so eager to know what she had been doing that he began to dig in the very spot where Mrs.
Turtle had dug before him.
It took Fatty Coon only about six seconds to discover Mrs.
Turtle 's secret.
Turtle had left there in the warm sand to hatch.
THAT was why she looked all around to make sure that no one saw her.
THAT was why she seemed so pleased.
For Mrs.
But it never happened that way at all.
For as soon as he got over his surprise at seeing them , Fatty Coon began at once to eat those twenty - seven eggs.
They were delicious.
And as he finished the last one he could n't help thinking how lucky he had been"
`` Be quiet , my child ,"
said the old woman , `` and thou shalt have it.
Thy step-sister has long deserved death , to-night when she is asleep I will come and cut her head off.
Only be careful that thou art at the far-side of the bed , and push her well to the front"
It would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner , and heard everything.
When she had gone away , the girl got up and went to her sweetheart , who was called Roland , and knocked at his door.
When daylight comes , and she sees what she has done , we shall be lost"
`` But ,"
said Roland , `` I counsel thee first to take away her magic wand , or we can not escape if she pursues us"
Then she hurried away with her lover.
When the old witch got up next morning , she called her daughter , and wanted to give her the apron , but she did not come.
Then the witch cried , `` Where art thou ?"
`` Here , on the stairs , I am sweeping ,"
answered the first drop of blood.
The old woman went out , but saw no one on the stairs , and cried again , `` Where art thou ?"
`` Here in the kitchen , I am warming myself ,"
cried the second drop of blood.
She went into the kitchen , but found no one.
Then she cried again , `` Where art thou ?"
`` Ah , here in the bed , I am sleeping"
cried the third drop of blood.
She went into the room to the bed.
What did she see there ? Her own child , whose head she had cut off , bathed in her blood.
`` That shall not serve you ,"
cried she , `` even if you have got a long way off , you shall still not escape me"
She put on her many league boots , in which went an hour 's walk at every step , and it was not long before she overtook them.
On this the girl and her sweetheart Roland resumed their natural shapes again , and they walked on the whole night until daybreak.
Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge , and her sweetheart Roland into a fiddler.
`` Oh , yes ,"
he replied , `` I will play to you while you do it"
When they were delivered , Roland said , `` Now I will go to my father and arrange for the wedding"
`` Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait for thee ,"
said the girl , `` and that no one may recognize me , I will change myself into a red stone land-mark"
Then Roland went away , and the girl stood like a red land-mark in the field and waited for her beloved.
But when Roland got home , he fell into the snares of another , who prevailed on him so far that he forgot the maiden.
From that time forth , strange things happened in the shepherd 's house.
The shepherd did as she bade him , and next morning just as day dawned , he saw the chest open , and the flower come out.
Swiftly he sprang towards it , and threw a white cloth over it.
She told him her story , and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him , but she answered , `` No ,"
Everything he had forgotten , and which had vanished from his mind , had suddenly come home again to his heart.
Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland , and grief came to an end and joy began"
A poor man had twelve children and was forced to work night and day to give them even bread.
I will hold thy child at its christening , and will take charge of it and make it happy on earth"
The man said , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am God"
`` Then I do not desire to have thee for a godfather ,"
said the man ; `` thou givest to the rich , and leavest the poor to hunger"
Thus spoke the man , for he did not know how wisely God apportions riches and poverty.
He turned therefore away from the Lord , and went farther.
The man asked , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am the Devil"
`` Then I do not desire to have thee for godfather ,"
said the man ; `` thou deceivest men and leadest them astray"
He went onwards , and then came person_0 striding up to him with withered legs , and said , `` Take me as godfather"
The man asked , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am person_0 , and I make all equal"
Then said the man , `` Thou art the right one , thou takest the rich as well as the poor , without distinction ; thou shalt be godfather"
person_0 answered , `` I will make thy child rich and famous , for he who has me for a friend can lack nothing"
The man said , `` Next Sunday is the christening ; be there at the right time"
person_0 appeared as he had promised , and stood godfather quite in the usual way.
When the boy had grown up , his godfather one day appeared and bade him go with him.
I make thee a celebrated physician.
When thou art called to a patient , I will always appear to thee.
But beware of using the herb against my will , or it might fare ill with thee"
It was not long before the youth was the most famous physician in the whole world.
`` He had only to look at the patient and he knew his condition at once , and if he would recover , or must needs die"
Now it so befell that the King became ill , and the physician was summoned , and was to say if recovery were possible.
`` If I could but cheat person_0 for once ,"
He therefore took up the sick man , and laid him the other way , so that now person_0 was standing by his head.
Then he gave the King some of the herb , and he recovered and grew healthy again.
Soon afterwards the King 's daughter fell into a severe illness.
When the physician came to the sick girl 's bed , he saw person_0 by her feet.
He raised up the sick girl , and placed her head where her feet had lain.
Then he gave her some of the herb , and instantly her cheeks flushed red , and life stirred afresh in her.
and seized him so firmly with his ice-cold hand , that he could not resist , and led him into a cave below the earth.
There he saw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in countless rows , some large , others half-sized , others small.
Every instant some were extinguished , and others again burnt up , so that the flames seemed to leap hither and thither in perpetual change.
`` See ,"
said person_0 , `` these are the lights of men 's lives.
`` Show me the light of my life ,"
said the physician , and he thought that it would be still very tall.
person_0 pointed to a little end which was just threatening to go out , and said , `` Behold , it is there"
`` Ah , dear godfather ,"
`` I can not ,"
answered person_0 , `` one must go out before a new one is lighted"
`` Then place the old one on a new one , that will go on burning at once when the old one has come to an end ,"
pleaded the physician.
Immediately the physician fell on the ground , and now he himself was in the hands of person_0"
There was once upon a time a person_0 who had no children.
At last a Fakir came along , and he said to the person_0 , `` Man , why are you lying here ?"
He replied , `` Fakir , a thousand men have come and passed by ; you pass on too"
But the Fakir said , `` Who are you , man ?"
The person_0 replied , `` I am a person_0 , Fakir.
Of goods and gold I have no lack , but I have lived long and have no children.
So I have come here , and have laid me down at the cross-roads.
The Fakir answered him , `` Oh person_0 ! If you have children , what will you give me ?"
`` Whatever you ask , Fakir ,"
answered the person_0.
The person_0 took the sweetmeats and put them in his bosom.
The person_0 said , `` Well , I agree"
Then the Fakir went on his way , and the person_0 came home and gave one sweetmeat to each of his two wives.
After some time two sons were born to the person_0.
Then what did the person_0 do but place those two sons in an underground room , which he had built in the earth.
Some time passed , and one day the Fakir appeared , and said , `` person_0 ! bring me that son of yours !"
What did the person_0 do but bring two slave-girls ' sons and present them to the Fakir.
While the Fakir was sitting there the person_0 's sons were sitting down below in their cellar eating their food.
Just then a hungry ant had carried away a grain of rice from their food , and was going along with it to her children.
Another stronger ant came up and attacked her in order to get this grain of rice.
On this the second ant let go and did not rob the first , but went off to where the person_0 's sons were eating their food.
On hearing this the Fakir said , `` person_0 ! these are not your sons ; go and bring those children who are eating their food in the cellar"
Then the person_0 went and brought his own sons.
So the person_0 's son went out to gather cow-dung , and when he had collected some he brought it in.
Then the Fakir looked at the person_0 's son and put on a great pot , and said , `` Come round here , my pupil"
But the person_0 's son said , `` Master first , and pupil after"
Then the Fakir made a dash at the person_0 's son , thinking to catch him and throw him into the caldron.
There were about a hundred gallons of oil in this caldron , and the fire was burning beneath it.
He then saw a key of the Fakir 's lying there ; he took this key and opened the door of the Fakir 's house.
So the person_0 's son let all the creatures go , and took them out of the house , and they all returned thanks to God.
Next he let out all the men who were in prison.
Come , I will fight you"
The bald man said , `` If I throw you , you shall be my slave ; and if you throw me , I will be your slave"
So they got ready and began to fight , and the person_0 's son threw him.
I appoint the tiger as guard over my property.
And you are my slave , you , too , must stay here with my belongings"
So the person_0 's son started off to the city to see the sights , and arrived at a pool.
He saw that it was a pleasant pool , and thought he would stop and bathe there , and therewith he began to strip off his clothes.
So she said to her father , `` My father ; I wish to marry"
`` Good ,"
said her father.
He went in and sat down.
The person_0 's daughter came out and sat in the balcony , and cast her glance round all the assembly.
She noticed that the traveller Prince was sitting in the assembly in Fakir 's attire.
The handmaiden obeyed the Princess 's order , went to him , and sprinkled the scent over him.
Then the people said , `` The slave-girl has made a mistake"
But she replied , `` The slave-girl has made no mistake , ` tis her mistress has made the mistake"
On this the person_0 married his daughter to the Fakir , who was really no Fakir , but a Prince.
What fate had decreed came to pass in that country , and they were married.
One day the traveller Prince said , `` Let all the person_0 's sons-in-law come out with me to-day to hunt"
People said , `` What is this Fakir that he should go a-hunting ?"
However , they all set out for the hunt , and fixed their meeting-place at a certain pool.
Instantly they killed and brought in a great number.
Then taking with him these spoils of the chase , the Prince came to the pool settled on as a meeting-place.
Thence they returned home to the town , and went to the person_0 their father-in-law , to present their game.
Now that person_0 had no son.
Then the new Prince told him that in fact he , too , was a Prince.
At this the person_0 , his father-in-law , was greatly delighted and took him by the hand and embraced him.
`` Good-day , Father Hollenthe"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your daughter ?"
`` Oh , yes , if Mother Malcho -LRB- Milch-cow -RRB- , Brother High-and-Mighty , Sister K setraut , and fair Katrinelje are willing , you can have her"
`` Where is Mother Malcho , then ?"
`` She is in the cow-house , milking the cow"
`` Good-day , Mother Malcho"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your daughter ?"
`` Oh , yes , if Father Hollenthe , Brother High-and-Mighty , Sister K setraut , and fair Katrinelje are willing , you can have her"
`` Where is Brother High-and-Mighty , then ?"
`` He is in the room chopping some wood"
`` Good-day , Brother High-and-Mighty"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your sister ?"
`` Oh , yes , if Father Hollenthe , Mother Malcho , Sister K setraut , and fair Katrinelje are willing , you can have her"
`` Where is Sister K setraut , then ?"
`` She is in the garden cutting cabbages"
`` Good-day , sister K setraut"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your sister ?"
`` Oh , yes , if Father Hollenthe , Mother Malcho , Brother High-and - Mighty , and fair Katrinelje are willing , you may have her"
`` Where is fair Katrinelje , then ?"
`` She is in the room counting out her farthings"
`` Good day , fair Katrinelje"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` Wilt thou be my bride ?"
`` Oh , yes , if Father Hollenthe , Mother Malcho , Brother High-and-Mighty , and Sister K setraut are willing , I am ready"
`` Fair Katrinelje , how much dowry do hast thou ?"
And many other things are mine , Have I not a dowry fine ? `` Pif-paf-poltrie , what is thy trade ? Art thou a tailor ?"
`` Something better"
`` A shoemaker ?"
`` Something better"
`` A husbandman ?"
`` Something better"
`` A joiner ?"
`` Something better"
`` A smith ?"
`` Something better"
`` A miller ?"
`` Something better"
`` Perhaps a broom-maker ?"
`` Yes , that 's what I am , is it not a fine trade ?"
A very wealthy old man , imagining that he was on the point of death , sent for his sons and divided his property among them.
However , he did not die for several years afterwards ; and miserable years many of them were.
Besides the weariness of old age , the old fellow had to bear with much abuse and cruelty from his sons.
And they let the poor old man know what they felt.
One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles.
He did so ; in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of stones and gravel before him.
`` Look here , friend ,"
said he.
`` Your sons will get to know of my coming here to-day , and will inquire about it.
Keep these bags in your own hands , and on no account let your sons get to them as long as you are alive.
You will soon find them change their conduct towards you.
Salaam.
I will come again soon to see how you are getting on"
When the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth they began to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than ever before.
Whatever she did , he was not satisfied , but grumbled and scolded , and knocked her about and beat her.
As the authorities at last heard of it , they had him summoned , and put in prison in order to make him better.
He was kept for a while on bread and water , and then set free again.
All went on well for a time , but then he fell into his old ways , and was surly and quarrelsome.
And because he dared not beat her , he would seize her by the hair and tear it out.
When he hit her he laughed , and when he missed her , he stormed and swore.
This went on so long that the neighbors came to the wife 's assistance.
The tailor was again summoned before the magistrates , and reminded of his promise.
`` Dear gentlemen ,"
said he , `` I have kept my word , I have not beaten her , but have shared joy and sorrow with her"
`` How can that be ,"
said the judge , `` when she continually brings such heavy complaints against you ?"
The judges were not satisfied with this answer , but gave him the reward he deserved"
`` I thank you kindly , little dog , I fare as well as you !"
Old Rhyme.
ONCE upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called person_0 , who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea.
`` Come in good time , my dear Duchess ,"
said person_0 's letter , `` and we will have something so very nice.
I am baking it in a pie-dish -- a pie - dish with a pink rim.
You never tasted anything so good ! And YOU shall eat it all ! _ I _ will eat muffins , my dear Duchess !"
wrote person_0.
Duchess read the letter and wrote an answer : -- `` I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four.
But it is very strange.
_ I _ was just going to invite you to come here , to supper , my dear person_0 , to eat something MOST DELICIOUS"
`` I will come very punctually , my dear person_0 ,"
wrote Duchess ; and then at the end she added -- `` I hope it is n't mouse ?"
And then she thought that did not look quite polite ; so she scratched out `` is n't mouse"
and changed it to `` I hope it will be fine ,"
and she gave her letter to the postman.
But she thought a great deal about person_0 's pie , and she read person_0 's letter over and over again.
`` I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse !"
said Duchess to herself -- `` I really could n't , COULD N'T eat mouse pie.
And I shall have to eat it , because it is a party.
And MY pie was going to be veal and ham.
A pink and white pie-dish ! and so is mine ; just like person_0 's dishes ; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit 's"
Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it"
A playful jest can scarcely give offence : Who knows too much , oft shows a want of sense.
-- But why dismiss ? -- their wishes are to please : And , truly , no necessity appears For solitude : -- consider well your years.
My latter days I 'll now devote with care , To guard the sex from ev ` ry latent snare.
THE FAIR my pages safely may pursue , And this apology they 'll not refuse.
Crowns , jewels , palaces , appeared as naught.
'Twas solely beauteous woman now he sought.
THIS savage , solitary , rustick school , The father chose his infancy to rule.
His partner 's death produced distaste of life , And made him fear to seek another wife.
A hermit 's gloomy , mossy cell he took , And wished his child might thither solely look.
In tears he viewed his son the forest quit , And fain would have him for the world unfit.
THE city 's palaces and lofty spires , Our rustick 's bosom filled with new desires.
The prince 's residence great splendor showed , And lively pleasure on the youth bestowed.

There was one on a time a great war , and when it came to an end , many soldiers were discharged.
person_0.
person_0ill I will give you something"
Thereupon he divided the loaf into four parts , and gave the apostle one of them , and a kreuzer likewise.
person_0.
Brother person_1 spoke as he had done before , and again gave him a quarter of the loaf and one kreuzer.
person_0.
Brother person_1 gave him also the third quarter of bread and the third kreuzer.
person_0.
Peter thanked him , and Brother person_1 went onwards , and had but a quarter of the loaf , and one kreuzer.
With that he went into an inn , ate the bread , and ordered one kreuzer 's worth of beer.
When he had had it , he journeyed onwards , and then person_0.
`` Where am I to procure it ?"
answered Brother person_1 ; `` I have been discharged , and I got nothing but a loaf of ammunition-bread and four kreuzers in money.
I met three beggars on the road , and I gave each of them a quarter of my bread , and one kreuzer.
The last quarter I ate in the inn , and had a drink with the last kreuzer.
Now my pockets are empty , and if thou also hast nothing we can go a-begging together"
`` No ,"
answered person_0.
Peter , `` we need not quite do that.
I know a little about medicine , and I will soon earn as much as I require by that"
`` Indeed ,"
said Brother person_1 , `` I know nothing of that , so I must go and beg alone"
`` Just come with me ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` and if I earn anything , thou shalt have half of it"
`` All right ,"
said Brother person_1 , so they went away together.
`` person_0op that howling and crying ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` I will make the man well again ,"
In great delight the man and his wife said , `` How can we reward you ? What shall we give you ?"
But person_0.
Peter would take nothing , and the more the peasant folks offered him , the more he refused.
Brother person_1 , however , nudged person_0.
Peter , and said , `` Take something ; sure enough we are in need of it"
At length the woman brought a lamb and said to person_0.
Peter that he really must take that , but he would not.
Then person_0.
`` That is nothing ,"
said Brother person_1.
`` I will easily carry it ,"
and took it on his shoulder.
Peter , `` Look , that 's a good place , we might cook the lamb there , and eat it"
`` As you like ,"
answered person_0.
Thou must , however , not begin to eat until I have come back , I will come at the right time"
`` Well , go , then ,"
said Brother person_1 , `` I understand cookery , I will manage it"
Then person_0.
Peter went away , and Brother person_1 killed the lamb , lighted a fire , threw the meat into the kettle , and boiled it.
`` That is said to be the best part ,"
said he , and tasted it , but at last he ate it all up.
At length person_0.
Peter returned and said , `` Thou mayst eat the whole of the lamb thyself , I will only have the heart , give me that"
`` But where can it be ?"
said the apostle.
`` I do n't know ,"
`` Oh ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` that is something quite new ! Every animal has a heart , why is a lamb to have none ?"
`` No , be assured , my brother ,"
said Brother person_1 , `` that a lamb has no heart ; just consider it seriously , and then you will see that it really has none"
`` Well , it is all right ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` if there is no heart , then I want none of the lamb ; thou mayst eat it alone"
`` What I ca n't eat now , I will carry away in my knapsack ,"
said Brother person_1 , and he ate half the lamb , and put the rest in his knapsack.
They went farther , and then person_0.
Peter caused a great stream of water to flow right across their path , and they were obliged to pass through it.
Said person_0.
Peter , `` Do thou go first"
`` No ,"
answered Brother person_1 , `` thou must go first ,"
and he thought , `` if the water is too deep I will stay behind"
Then person_0.
Peter strode through it , and the water just reached to his knee.
So Brother person_1 began to go through also , but the water grew deeper and reached to his throat.
Then he cried , `` Brother , help me !"
person_0.
Peter said , `` Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb 's heart ?"
`` No ,"
said he , `` I have not eaten it"
Then the water grew deeper still and rose to his mouth.
`` Help me , brother ,"
cried the soldier.
person_0.
Peter said , `` Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb 's heart ?"
`` No ,"
he replied , `` I have not eaten it"
person_0.
Peter , however , would not let him be drowned , but made the water sink and helped him through it.
Then they journeyed onwards , and came to a kingdom where they heard that the King 's daughter lay sick unto death.
`` Hollo , brother !"
said the soldier to person_0.
Peter , `` this is a chance for us ; if we can heal her we shall be provided for , for life !"
But person_0.
Peter was not half quick enough for him , `` Come , lift your legs , my dear brother ,"
said he , `` that we may get there in time"
But person_0.
`` Now we are done for !"
said Brother person_1 ; `` that comes of thy sleepy way of walking !"
`` Just be quiet ,"
answered person_0.
Peter , `` I can do more than cure sick people ; I can bring dead ones to life again"
`` Well , if thou canst do that ,"
said Brother person_1 , `` it 's all right , but thou shouldst earn at least half the kingdom for us by that"
Then they went to the royal palace , where every one was in great grief , but person_0.
Peter told the King that he would restore his daughter to life.
He was taken to her , and said , `` Bring me a kettle and some water ,"
and when that was brought , he bade everyone go out , and allowed no one to remain with him but Brother person_1.
When he had done that , he stepped forward and said three times , `` In the name of the holy Trinity , dead woman , arise"
And at the third time , the princess arose , living , healthy and beautiful.
Then the King was in the greatest joy , and said to person_0.
Peter , `` Ask for thy reward ; even if it were half my kingdom , I would give it thee"
But person_0.
Peter said , `` I want nothing for it"
`` Oh , thou tomfool !"
person_0.
Then they went on their way , and when they came to a forest , person_0.
Peter said to Brother person_1 , `` Now , we will divide the gold"
`` Yes ,"
he replied , `` we will"
So person_0.
Peter divided the gold , and divided it into three heaps.
But person_0.
`` Oh , I ate that !"
replied Brother person_1 , and hastily swept up the gold.
`` You may trust what I say"
`` But how can that be true ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` when a lamb has no heart ?"
`` Eh , what , brother , what can you be thinking of ? Lambs have hearts like other animals , why should only they have none ?"
`` Well , so be it ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` keep the gold to yourself , but I will stay with you no longer ; I will go my way alone"
`` As you like , dear brother ,"
answered Brother person_1.
`` Farewell"
Then person_0.
Then he arrived in a certain country where he heard that a King 's daughter was dead.
`` Oh , ho !"
So he went to the King , and offered to raise the dead girl to life again.
Peter do.
Then he stood before them and said , `` In the name of the most holy Trinity , dead maiden , I bid thee arise ,"
and he said this thrice , but the bones did not stir.
So he said it thrice more , but also in vain : `` Confounded girl that you are , get up !"
cried he , `` Get up , or it shall be worse for you !"
When he had said that , person_0.
`` Dear brother , I have done everything to the best of my ability ,"
he answered.
Thereupon person_0.
and the King 's daughter arose , healthy and beautiful as before.
Then person_0.
`` I should just like to know ,"
When he got out , person_0.
`` How can I help that ,"
answered Brother person_1 , `` if people will put it in for me ?"
`` Well , I tell thee this , that if ever thou settest about anything of this kind again thou shalt suffer for it !"
`` Eh , brother , have no fear , now I have money , why should I trouble myself with washing bones ?"
`` Faith ,"
said person_0.
Farewell , thou wilt now never see me more"
`` Good-bye ,"
But of the magical power which had been bestowed on his knapsack , he thought no more.
Brother person_1 traveled about with his money , and squandered and wasted what he had as before.
When at last he had no more than four kreuzers , he passed by an inn and thought , `` The money must go ,"
and ordered three kreuzers ' worth of wine and one kreuzer 's worth of bread for himself.
As he was sitting there drinking , the smell of roast goose made its way to his nose.
Brother person_1 looked about and peeped , and saw that the host had two geese standing in the oven.
and when he had said that , he unbuckled it and looked in , and there they were inside it.
`` Ah , that 's right !"
said he , `` now I am a made man !"
and went away to a meadow and took out the roast meat.
Brother person_1 thought to himself , `` One is enough for me ,"
and called the two men up and said , `` Take the goose , and eat it to my health"
The landlord ran thither , and behold the oven was empty ! `` What !"
The two said , `` We are no thieves , a discharged soldier gave us the goose , outside there in the meadow"
`` You shall not throw dust in my eyes that way ! the soldier was here but he went out by the door , like an honest fellow.
I looked after him myself ; you are the thieves and shall pay !"
But as they could not pay , he took a stick , and cudgeled them out of the house.
Brother person_1 went his way and came to a place where there was a magnificent castle , and not far from it a wretched inn.
`` It surprises me that they should come to you and not go to that splendid castle ,"
said Brother person_1.
`` Ah , indeed ,"
`` If others have tried it ,"
said Brother person_1 , `` I will try it too"
`` Leave it alone ,"
said the host , `` it will cost you your neck"
`` It wo n't kill me at once ,"
said Brother person_1 , `` just give me the key , and some good food and wine"
Brother person_1 said , `` Well , dance as long as you like , but none of you must come too close"
But the devils pressed continually nearer to him , and almost stepped on his face with their hideous feet.
`` person_0op , you devils ' ghosts ,"
said he , but they behaved still worse.
Then Brother person_1 grew angry , and cried , `` Hola ! but I will soon make it quiet ,"
and got the leg of a chair and struck out into the midst of them with it.
`` Devils ' crew ,"
cried he , `` it is getting too bad , but wait.
Into my knapsack , all nine of you !"
In an instant they were in it , and then he buckled it up and threw it into a corner.
After this all was suddenly quiet , and Brother person_1 lay down again , and slept till it was bright day.
`` The reason why they have not ,"
`` No ,"
replied Brother person_1 , `` I am used to wandering about , I will travel farther"
So they smote with their great hammers with all their strength , and the devils uttered howls which were quite pitiable.
`` I should be a fool ,"
thought Brother person_1 , `` if I were to take the narrow , rough road"
So he set out and took the broad and pleasant road , and at length came to a great black door , which was the door of Hell.
Brother person_1 knocked , and the door-keeper peeped out to see who was there.
He once gave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it"
thought he , `` I will see if I can find a place for myself in heaven , for I must be somewhere"
So he turned about and went onwards until he came to the door of Heaven , where he knocked.
person_0.
Peter was sitting hard by as door-keeper.
Brother person_1 recognized him at once , and thought , `` Here I find an old friend , I shall get on better"
But person_0.
Peter said , `` I really believe that thou wantest to come into Heaven"
`` Let me in , brother ; I must get in somewhere ; if they would have taken me into Hell , I should not have come here"
`` No ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` thou shalt not enter"
`` Then if thou wilt not let me in , take thy knapsack back , for I will have nothing at all from thee"
`` Give it here , then ,"
said person_0.
Peter.
Then Brother person_1 gave him the knapsack into Heaven through the bars , and person_0.
Peter took it , and hung it beside his seat.
Then said Brother person_1 , `` And now I wish myself inside my knapsack ,"
and in a second he was in it , and in Heaven , and person_0.
Peter was forced to let him stay there"
But in the little fishing village , more than for being a clever fisher of the sea was he known for his kind heart.
One soft summer twilight he was going home at the end of a day 's fishing when he came upon a group of children.
Now person_0 felt very sorry for the poor tortoise and made up his mind to rescue it.
He spoke to the boys : `` Look here , boys , you are treating that poor tortoise so badly that it will soon die !"
One of the older boys answered : `` Who cares whether it lives or dies ? We do not.
Here , boys , go on , go on !"
And they began to treat the poor tortoise more cruelly than ever.
person_0 waited a moment , turning over in his mind what would be the best way to deal with the boys.
`` No , we wo n't give you the tortoise ,"
said one of the boys.
`` Why should we ? We caught it ourselves"
`` What you say is true ,"
said person_0 , `` but I do not ask you to give it to me for nothing.
I will give you some money for it -- in other words , the Ojisan -LRB- Uncle -RRB- will buy it of you.
Wo n't that do for you , my boys ?"
He held up the money to them , strung on a piece of string through a hole in the center of each coin.
`` Look , boys , you can buy anything you like with this money.
You can do much more with this money than you can with that poor tortoise.
See what good boys you are to listen to me"
as they say in Japan.
Gradually they all came up to him , the ringleader of the little band holding out the tortoise to him.
`` Very well , Ojisan , we will give you the tortoise if you will give us the money !"
And person_0 took the tortoise and gave the money to the boys , who , calling to each other , scampered away and were soon out of sight.
Luckily I was passing by and saved you , and so life is still yours.
Now I am going to take you back to your home , the sea , at once.
Do not let yourself be caught again , for there might be no one to save you next time !"
The next morning person_0 went out as usual in his boat.
The weather was fine and the sea and sky were both blue and soft in the tender haze of the summer morning.
person_0 got into his boat and dreamily pushed out to sea , throwing his line as he did so.
He was suddenly startled from his reverie by hearing his own name called : `` person_0 , person_0 !"
Clear as a bell and soft as the summer wind the name floated over the sea.
person_0 saw with surprise that it was the very tortoise he had rescued the day before.
`` Well , Mr.
Tortoise ,"
said person_0 , `` was it you who called my name just now ?"
The tortoise nodded its head several times and said : `` Yes , it was I.
`` Indeed ,"
said person_0 , `` that is very polite of you.
Come up into the boat.
I would offer you a smoke , but as you are a tortoise doubtless you do not smoke ,"
and the fisherman laughed at the joke.
`` He-he-he-he !"
laughed the tortoise ; `` sake -LRB- rice wine -RRB- is my favorite refreshment , but I do not care for tobacco"
`` Indeed ,"
said person_0 , `` I regret very much that I have no `` sake"
in my boat to offer you , but come up and dry your back in the sun -- tortoises always love to do that"
It must be very far away , if it exists at all !"
It is far away at the bottom of the sea , but if I take you there we shall soon reach the place.
If you would like to see the person_1 King 's land I will be your guide"
Before the fisherman could say more the tortoise stopped him , saying : `` What ? You need not swim yourself.
If you will ride on my back I will take you without any trouble on your part"
`` But ,"
said person_0 , `` how is it possible for me to ride on your small back ?"
`` It may seem absurd to you.
but I assure you that you can do so.
Try at once ! Just come and get on my back , and see if it is as impossible as you think !"
`` This is strange indeed !"
said person_0 ; `` then.
Mr.
Tortoise , with your kind permission I will get on your back.
Dokoisho !"
-LRB- Footnote : `` All right"
-LRB- only used by lower classes -RRB-.
-RRB- he exclaimed as he jumped on.
and with these words he leapt into the sea with person_0 on his back.
Down through the water the tortoise dived.
For a long time these two strange companions rode through the sea.
person_0 never grew tired , nor his clothes moist with the water.
`` Ya"
exclaimed person_0.
`` that looks like the gate of some large palace just appearing ! Mr.
Tortoise , can you tell what that place is we can now see ?"
`` That is the great gate of the Rin Gin Palace , the large roof that you see behind the gate is the person_1 King 's Palace itself"
`` Then we have at last come to the realm of the person_1 King and to his Palace ,"
said person_0.
`` Yes , indeed ,"
answered the tortoise , `` and do n't you think we have come very quickly ?"
And while he was speaking the tortoise reached the side of the gate.
`` And here we are , and you must please walk from here"
The tortoise now went in front , and speaking to the gatekeeper , said : `` This is person_0 Taro , from the country of Japan.
I have had the honor of bringing him as a visitor to this kingdom.
Please show him the way"
Then the gatekeeper , who was a fish , at once led the way through the gate before them.
`` person_0 Sama , person_0 Sama ! welcome to the person_1 Palace , the home of the Dragon King of the person_1.
Thrice welcome are you , having come from such a distant country.
And you , Mr.
Tortoise , we are greatly indebted to you for all your trouble in bringing person_0 here"
Then , turning again to person_0 , they said , `` Please follow us this way ,"
and from here the whole band of fishes became his guides.
When he reached the portals a beautiful Princess with her attendant maidens came out to welcome him.
person_0 was lost in wonder while he looked upon her , and he could not speak.
`` person_0 Taro , it gives me the highest pleasure to welcome you to my father 's kingdom ,"
said the Princess.
`` Yesterday you set free a tortoise , and I have sent for you to thank you for saving my life , for I was that tortoise.
Beyond all words , this is the most wonderful place I have ever seen"
While he was speaking a train of fishes appeared , all dressed in ceremonial , trailing garments.
The bridal was celebrated with dazzling splendor , and in the person_1 King 's realm there was great rejoicing.
person_0 enjoyed himself with all his heart.
Never in his whole life had he sat down to such a marvelous feast.
When the feast was over the Princes asked the bridegroom if he would like to walk through the palace and see all there was to be seen.
But , to person_0 , more wonderful than the palace was the garden that surrounded it.
Looking to the south all the trees were green in the fullness of summer , and the day cicala and the night cricket chirruped loudly.
Looking to the west the autumn maples were ablaze like a sunset sky , and the chrysanthemums were in perfection.
What can have happened to them all this time ? How anxious they must have been these days when I did not return as usual.
I must go back at once without letting one more day pass"
And he began to prepare for the journey in great haste.
-LRB- for that was her name -RRB- , `` and you have been kinder to me than any words can tell.
But now I must say good-by.
I must go back to my old parents"
Do not think that I wish to leave you.
It is not that.
I must go and see my old parents.
Let me go for one day and I will come back to you"
`` Then ,"
said the Princess sorrowfully , `` there is nothing to be done.
and she brought him a beautiful lacquer box tied about with a silken cord and tassels of red silk.
and then he added : `` Tell me what is this box ?"
`` That ,"
answered the Princess `` is the tamate-bako -LRB- Box of the Jewel Hand -RRB- , and it contains something very precious.
And person_0 promised that he would never , never open the box whatever happened.
He quickly mounted the creature 's back and was carried away over the shining sea into the East.
Then , with his face turned eagerly towards his own land , he looked for the rising of the blue hills on the horizon before him.
At last the tortoise carried him into the bay he knew so well , and to the shore from whence he had set out.
He stepped on to the shore and looked about him while the tortoise rode away back to the person_1 King 's realm.
Wondering what it can mean he walks quickly towards his old home.
Even that looks different , but a house stands on the spot , and he calls out : `` Father , I have just returned !"
and he was about to enter , when he saw a strange man coming out.
`` Perhaps my parents have moved while I have been away , and have gone somewhere else ,"
was the fisherman 's thought.
Somehow he began to feel strangely anxious , he could not tell why.
`` Excuse me ,"
said he to the man who was staring at him , `` but till within the last few days I have lived in this house.
My name is person_0 Taro.
Where have my parents gone whom I left here ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the fisherman , `` I am person_0 Taro !"
`` Ha , ha !"
laughed the man , `` you must not make such jokes.
He could not possibly be alive now !"
I am really person_0 Taro , and I certainly have not lived three hundred years.
Till four or five days ago I lived on this spot.
Tell me what I want to know without more joking , please"
But the person_0 Taro of whom I have heard is a man who lived three hundred years ago.
Perhaps you are his spirit come to revisit your old home ?"
`` Why do you mock me ?"
said person_0.
`` I am no spirit ! I am a living man -- do you not see my feet ;"
and `` don-don ,"
he stamped on the ground , first with one foot and then with the other to show the man.
-LRB- Japanese ghosts have no feet.
person_0 was lost in bewilderment and trouble.
He seemed to be in a strange dream.
There was no use in staying here any longer.
He must get back to his beautiful wife beyond the sea.
He made his way back to the beach , carrying in his hand the box which the Princess had given him.
But which was the way ? He could not find it alone ! Suddenly he remembered the box , the tamate-bako.
`` The Princess told me when she gave me the box never to open it -- that it contained a very precious thing.
There is nothing else for me to do now.
Yes , yes , I will open the box and look in !"
And so his heart consented to this act of disobedience , and he tried to persuade himself that he was doing the right thing in breaking his promise.
Slowly , very slowly , he untied the red silk cord , slowly and wonderingly he lifted the lid of the precious box.
And what did he find ? Strange to say only a beautiful little purple cloud rose out of the box in three soft wisps.
For an instant it covered his face and wavered over him as if loath to go , and then it floated away like vapor over the sea.
person_0 , who had been till that moment like a strong and handsome youth of twenty-four , suddenly became very , very old.
His back doubled up with age , his hair turned snowy white , his face wrinkled and he fell down dead on the beach.
Poor person_0 ! because of his disobedience he could never return to the person_1 King 's realm or the lovely Princess beyond the sea.
Little children , never be disobedient to those who are wiser than you for disobedience was the beginning of all the miseries and sorrows of life"
There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in wait.
The huntsman had compassion on the poor old creature , felt in his pocket , and gave her what he could afford.
The huntsman thanked the wise woman , and thought to himself , `` Those are fine things that she has promised me , if all does but come true"
`` Well ,"
said the huntsman , `` this is wonderful , it has really come to pass just as the old wife foretold !"
and he took the gun from his shoulder , aimed and fired right into the midst of them , so that the feathers flew about.
The birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries , but one dropped down dead , and the cloak fell at the same time.
Next morning , when he awoke , the promise occurred to him , and he wished to see if it also had been fulfilled.
He then took leave of his parents , buckled on his huntsman 's pouch and gun , and went out into the world.
An old woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden , looking out of one of the windows.
He has a bird 's heart about him , by means of which a gold piece lies every morning under his pillow"
I have certainly money enough"
Nevertheless , the real reason was that he had caught sight of the pretty girl.
He entered the house , and was well received and courteously entertained.
The old woman then said , `` Now we must have the bird 's heart , he will never miss it"
She did so , saying , `` Now , my dearest , drink to me"
So he took the cup , and when he had swallowed the draught , he brought up the heart of the bird.
The girl had to take it away secretly and swallow it herself , for the old woman would have it so.
Then the old witch said , `` We have the bird 's heart , but we must also take the wishing-cloak away from him"
The girl answered , `` We will leave him that , he has lost his wealth"
The old woman was angry and said , `` Such a mantle is a wonderful thing , and is seldom to be found in this world.
I must and will have it !"
She gave the girl several blows , and said that if she did not obey , it should fare ill with her.
So she did the old woman 's bidding , placed herself at the window and looked on the distant country , as if she were very sorrowful.
The huntsman asked , `` Why dost thou stand there so sorrowfully ?"
`` Ah , my beloved ,"
was her answer , `` over yonder lies the Garnet Mountain , where the precious stones grow.
`` Hast thou nothing else to complain of ?"
said the huntsman.
`` I will soon remove that burden from thy heart"
Precious stones were glistening on every side so that it was a joy to see them , and together they gathered the finest and costliest of them.
Now , the old woman had , through her sorceries , contrived that the eyes of the huntsman should become heavy.
He said to the maiden , `` We will sit down and rest awhile , I am so tired that I can no longer stand on my feet"
Then they sat down , and he laid his head in her lap , and fell asleep.
and sat down there in care and sorrow , not knowing what to do.
Then the giants came up , and the first kicked him with his foot and said , `` What sort of an earth-worm is lying curled up here ?"
The second said , `` Step upon him and kill him"
So saying they passed by.
Four legs grew on him , a large head and two thick ears , and he saw with horror that he was changed into an ass.
Still as his hunger increased every minute , and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his present nature , he went on eating with great zest.
Then the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue.
Then he took the cabbages with him , climbed over the wall , and went forth to seek for the castle of his sweetheart.
After wandering about for a couple of days he was lucky enough to find it again.
He dyed his face brown , so that his own mother would not have known him ; and begged for shelter : `` I am so tired ,"
said he , `` that I can go no further"
The witch asked , `` Who are you , countryman , and what is your business ?"
`` I am a King 's messenger , and was sent out to seek the most delicious salad which grows beneath the sun.
When the old woman heard of the exquisite salad , she was greedy , and said , `` Dear countryman , let me just taste this wonderful salad"
`` Why not ?"
answered he , `` I have brought two heads with me , and will give you one of them ,"
and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad cabbage.
The witch suspected nothing amiss , and her mouth watered so for this new dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed it.
The huntsman thought , `` The salad must have already taken effect ,"
and said , `` I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it"
As he went down he saw the two asses running about in the courtyard ; the salad , however , was lying on the ground.
`` All right ,"
said he , `` the two have taken their portion ,"
and he picked up the other leaves , laid them on the dish , and carried them to the maiden.
`` I bring you the delicate food myself ,"
said he , `` in order that you may not have to wait longer"
and bound them together , all three with one rope , and drove them along until he came to a mill.
He knocked at the window , the miller put out his head , and asked what he wanted.
`` I have three unmanageable beasts ,"
answered he , `` which I do n't want to keep any longer.
The miller said , `` Why not ? But how am I to manage them ?"
After that he went back into the castle , and found therein everything he needed.
he continued , `` are certainly not dead , and are fed three times daily , but they are so sad that they can not last much longer"
The huntsman was moved to pity , put away his anger , and told the miller to drive them back again to him.
And when they came , he gave them some of the good salad , so that they became human again.
Your wishing-cloak hangs in a cupboard , and as for the bird 's - heart I will take a vomiting potion"
But he thought otherwise , and said , `` Keep it ; it is all the same , for I will take thee for my true wife"
So the wedding was celebrated , and they lived happily together until their death"
Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children.
The boy was called Hansel and the girl Grethel.
He had little to bite and to break , and once when great scarcity fell on the land , he could no longer procure daily bread.
`` I 'll tell you what , husband ,"
They will not find the way home again , and we shall be rid of them"
`` No , wife ,"
`` O , thou fool !"
said she , `` Then we must all four die of hunger , thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins ,"
and she left him no peace until he consented.
`` But I feel very sorry for the poor children , all the same ,"
said the man.
The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger , and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father.
Grethel wept bitter tears , and said to Hansel , `` Now all is over with us"
`` Be quiet , Grethel ,"
said Hansel , `` do not distress thyself , I will soon find a way to help us"
And when the old folks had fallen asleep , he got up , put on his little coat , opened the door below , and crept outside.
The moon shone brightly , and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies.
Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in.
Then he went back and said to Grethel , `` Be comforted , dear little sister , and sleep in peace , God will not forsake us ,"
and he lay down again in his bed.
Grethel took the bread under her apron , as Hansel had the stones in his pocket.
Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.
When they had walked a short time , Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house , and did so again and again.
`` Ah , father ,"
said Hansel , `` I am looking at my little white cat , which is sitting up on the roof , and wants to say good-bye to me"
The wife said , `` Fool , that is not thy little cat , that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys"
Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood together , as high as a little hill.
When we have done , we will come back and fetch you away"
And as they had been sitting such a long time , their eyes shut with fatigue , and they fell fast asleep.
When at last they awoke , it was already dark night.
Grethel began to cry and said , `` How are we to get out of the forest now ?"
But Hansel comforted her and said , `` Just wait a little , until the moon has risen , and then we will soon find the way"
They walked the whole night long , and by break of day came once more to their father 's house.
The father , however , rejoiced , for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.
The man 's heart was heavy , and he thought `` it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children"
The woman , however , would listen to nothing that he had to say , but scolded and reproached him.
The children were , however , still awake and had heard the conversation.
Nevertheless he comforted his little sister , and said , `` Do not cry , Grethel , go to sleep quietly , the good God will help us"
Early in the morning came the woman , and took the children out of their beds.
Their bit of bread was given to them , but it was still smaller than the time before.
On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket , and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.
`` Hansel , why dost thou stop and look round ?"
said the father , `` go on"
`` I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof , and wants to say good-bye to me ,"
answered Hansel.
`` Simpleton !"
said the woman , `` that is not thy little pigeon , that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney"
Hansel , however , little by little , threw all the crumbs on the path.
The woman led the children still deeper into the forest , where they had never in their lives been before.
When it was noon , Grethel shared her piece of bread with Hansel , who had scattered his by the way.
Then they fell asleep and evening came and went , but no one came to the poor children.
Hansel said to Grethel , `` We shall soon find the way ,"
but they did not find it.
And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer , they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.
It was now three mornings since they had left their father 's house.
`` We will set to work on that ,"
said Hansel , `` and have a good meal.
I will eat a bit of the roof , and thou , Grethel , canst eat some of the window , it will taste sweet"
Then a soft voice cried from the room , `` Nibble , nibble , gnaw , Who is nibbling at my little house ?"
The children answered , `` The wind , the wind , The heaven-born wind ,"
and went on eating without disturbing themselves.
Suddenly the door opened , and a very , very old woman , who supported herself on crutches , came creeping out.
Hansel and Grethel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.
No harm shall happen to you"
She took them both by the hand , and led them into her little house.
Then good food was set before them , milk and pancakes , with sugar , apples , and nuts.
Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen , and Hansel and Grethel lay down in them , and thought they were in heaven.
When a child fell into her power , she killed it , cooked and ate it , and that was a feast day with her.
When Hansel and Grethel came into her neighborhood , she laughed maliciously , and said mockingly , `` I have them , they shall not escape me again !"
Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand , carried him into a little stable , and shut him in with a grated door.
He might scream as he liked , that was of no use.
When he is fat , I will eat him"
Grethel began to weep bitterly , but it was all in vain , she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her.
And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel , but Grethel got nothing but crab-shells.
When four weeks had gone by , and Hansel still continued thin , she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer.
`` Hola , Grethel ,"
she cried to the girl , `` be active , and bring some water.
Let Hansel be fat or lean , to-morrow I will kill him , and cook him"
she cried.
`` If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us , we should at any rate have died together"
`` Just keep thy noise to thyself ,"
said the old woman , `` all that wo n't help thee at all"
Early in the morning , Grethel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water , and light the fire.
`` We will bake first ,"
said the old woman , `` I have already heated the oven , and kneaded the dough"
She pushed poor Grethel out to the oven , from which flames of fire were already darting.
`` Creep in ,"
said the witch , `` and see if it is properly heated , so that we can shut the bread in"
And when once Grethel was inside , she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it , and then she would eat her , too.
`` Silly goose ,"
said the old woman , `` The door is big enough ; just look , I can get in myself !"
and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven.
Then Grethel gave her a push that drove her far into it , and shut the iron door , and fastened the bolt.
Oh ! then she began to howl quite horribly , but Grethel ran away , and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.
Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it.
`` These are far better than pebbles !"
and filled her pinafore full.
`` But now we will go away"
said Hansel , `` that we may get out of the witch 's forest"
When they had walked for two hours , they came to a great piece of water.
`` We can not get over ,"
said Hansel , `` I see no foot-plank , and no bridge"
`` And no boat crosses either ,"
answered Grethel , `` but a white duck is swimming there ; if I ask her , she will help us over"
The duck came to them , and Hansel seated himself on its back , and told his sister to sit by him.
`` No ,"
replied Grethel , `` that will be too heavy for the little duck ; she shall take us across , one after the other"
Then they began to run , rushed into the parlor , and threw themselves into their father 's arms.
The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest ; the woman , however , was dead.
Then all anxiety was at an end , and they lived together in perfect happiness.
My tale is done , there runs a mouse , whosoever catches it , may make himself a big fur cap out of it"
Night fell , and nothing was left for him to do , but to seek a bed in this painful solitude.
It guided him to a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes.
`` Who are you , and what do you want ?"
asked the man in a grumbling voice.
`` I am a poor tailor ,"
he answered , `` whom night has surprised here in the wilderness , and I earnestly beg you to take me into your hut until morning"
`` Go your way ,"
replied the old man in a surly voice , `` I will have nothing to do with runagates ; seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere"
A violent sound of screaming and roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut.
The tailor , full of unwonted courage , jumped up , put his clothes on in haste , and hurried out.
Then close by the hut , he saw a great black bull and a beautiful stag , which were just preparing for a violent struggle.
They rushed at each other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling , and the air resounded with their cries.
He held with both hands to the tops of the horns , and resigned himself to his fate.
It seemed , however , to him just as if he were flying away.
At length the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock , and gently let the tailor down.
The tailor , more dead than alive , required a longer time than that to come to himself.
Flames of fire shot forth , after which followed a great smoke , which hid the stag from his sight.
His courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order.
The stone began to give way under his feet , and sank slowly down into the depths.
When it was once more firm , and the tailor looked round , he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former.
Here , however , there was more to look at and to admire.
Hollow places were cut in the walls , in which stood vases of transparent glass which were filled with colored spirit or with a bluish vapor.
On the floor of the hall two great glass chests stood opposite to each other , which at once excited his curiosity.
Everything was small , but exceedingly carefully and delicately made , and seemed to be cut out by a dexterous hand with the greatest exactitude.
It ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite.
`` Just Heaven !"
On the self - same day when they end , shall thy happiness begin.
Seat thyself , and listen to the story of my life : `` I am the daughter of a rich count.
In our house there was no lack of company ; neighbors and friends visited us often , and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one.
We granted his request with ready courtesy , and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories.
Hardly had I slept for a short time , when the sound of faint and delightful music awoke me.
I felt as if a mountain were weighing down my breast , and was unable to make the very slightest sound.
In the meantime , by the light of my night-lamp , I saw the stranger enter my room through two doors which were fast bolted.
My repugnance to his magic arts was , however , so great , that I vouchsafed him no answer.
I passed the night in the greatest disquietude , and only fell asleep towards morning.
`` I at once suspected nothing good.
I dressed myself quickly , ordered my palfrey to be saddled , and accompanied only by one servant , rode full gallop to the forest.
The servant fell with his horse , and could not follow me , for the horse had broken its foot.
Instead of answering me , he began to laugh loudly.
I fell to the ground , and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness.
`` When I came to my senses again I found myself in this underground cave in a glass coffin.
I answered him as little as I had done the first time.
He vanished and left me in my prison , in which a deep sleep came on me.
Help me to accomplish the other things which happened in those visions.
The first is that we lift the glass chest in which my castle is enclosed , on to that broad stone"
for he was afraid.
Or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the flesh creep , the listeners sometimes said `` Oh , it makes us shudder !"
The younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them , and could not imagine what they could mean.
`` They are always saying ` it makes me shudder , it makes me shudder ! ' It does not make me shudder ,"
thought he.
`` That , too , must be an art of which I understand nothing"
Look how thy brother works , but thou dost not even earn thy salt"
`` Well , father ,"
I do n't understand that at all yet"
He who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes"
The father sighed , and answered him `` thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder , but thou wilt not earn thy bread by that"
`` Just think ,"
said he , `` when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread , he actually wanted to learn to shudder"
`` If that be all ,"
replied the sexton , `` he can learn that with me.
Send him to me , and I will soon polish him"
The father was glad to do it , for he thought , `` It will train the boy a little"
The sexton therefore took him into his house , and he had to ring the bell.
`` Thou shalt soon learn what shuddering is ,"
`` Who is there ?"
cried he , but the figure made no reply , and did not move or stir.
`` Give an answer ,"
cried the boy , `` or take thy self off , thou hast no business here at night"
The sexton , however , remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost.
The sexton thought , `` he ca n't intend to be as bad as his words ,"
uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone.
Thereupon he rang the bell , went home , and without saying a word went to bed , and fell asleep.
The sexton 's wife waited a long time for her husband , but he did not come back.
`` No , I do n't know ,"
I should be sorry if it were"
The woman ran away and found her husband , who was lying moaning in the corner , and had broken his leg.
She carried him down , and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy 's father.
`` Your boy ,"
cried she , `` has been the cause of a great misfortune ! He has thrown my husband down the steps and made him break his leg.
Take the good-for-nothing fellow away from our house"
The father was terrified , and ran thither and scolded the boy.
`` What wicked tricks are these ?"
said he , `` the devil must have put this into thy head"
`` Father ,"
he replied , `` do listen to me.
I am quite innocent.
He was standing there by night like one who is intending to do some evil.
I did not know who it was , and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go away"
`` Ah ,"
said the father , `` I have nothing but unhappiness with you.
Go out of my sight.
I will see thee no more"
`` Yes , father , right willingly , wait only until it is day.
Then will I go forth and learn how to shudder , and then I shall , at any rate , understand one art which will support me"
`` Learn what thou wilt ,"
spake the father , `` it is all the same to me.
Here are fifty thalers for thee.
`` Yes , father , it shall be as you will.
If you desire nothing more than that , I can easily keep it in mind"
Sit down below it , and wait till night comes , and you will soon learn how to shudder"
`` If that is all that is wanted ,"
answered the youth , `` it is easily done ; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as that , thou shalt have my fifty thalers.
Just come back to me early in the morning"
Then the youth went to the gallows , sat down below it , and waited till evening came.
Then he stirred the fire , blew it , and set them all round it to warm themselves.
But they sat there and did not stir , and the fire caught their clothes.
So he said , `` Take care , or I will hang you up again"
The dead men , however , did not hear , but were quite silent , and let their rags go on burning.
and he hung them up again each in his turn.
`` No ,"
A waggoner who was striding behind him heard that and asked , `` Who are you ?"
`` I do n't know ,"
answered the youth.
Then the waggoner asked , `` From whence comest thou ?"
`` I know not"
`` Who is thy father ?"
`` That I may not tell thee"
`` What is it that thou art always muttering between thy teeth"
`` Ah ,"
replied the youth , `` I do so wish I could shudder , but no one can teach me how to do it"
`` Give up thy foolish chatter ,"
said the waggoner.
`` Come , go with me , I will see about a place for thee"
The youth went with the waggoner , and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night.
Then at the entrance of the room the youth again said quite loudly , `` If I could but shudder ! If I could but shudder !"
The host who heard this , laughed and said , `` If that is your desire , there ought to be a good opportunity for you here"
`` Ah , be silent ,"
But the youth said , `` However difficult it may be , I will learn it and for this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth"
The King had promised that he who would venture should have his daughter to wife , and she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on.
Already many men had gone into the castle , but as yet none had come out again.
Then the youth went next morning to the King and said if he were allowed he would watch three nights in the haunted castle.
Then he answered , `` Then I ask for a fire , a turning lathe , and a cutting-board with the knife"
The King had these things carried into the castle for him during the day.
`` Ah , if I could but shudder !"
said he , `` but I shall not learn it here either"
`` You simpletons !"
cried he , `` what are you crying about ? If you are cold , come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves"
After a short time , when they had warmed themselves , they said , `` Comrade , shall we have a game at cards ?"
`` Why not ?"
he replied , `` but just show me your paws"
Then they stretched out their claws.
`` Oh ,"
said he , `` what long nails you have ! Wait , I must first cut them for you"
Thereupon he seized them by the throats , put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast.
`` I have looked at your fingers ,"
said he , `` and my fancy for card-playing has gone ,"
and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water.
and began to cut them down.
Part of them ran away , the others he killed , and threw out into the fish-pond.
When he came back he fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself.
And as he thus sat , his eyes would keep open no longer , and he felt a desire to sleep.
Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner.
`` That is the very thing for me ,"
said he , and got into it.
`` That 's right ,"
said he , `` but go faster"
But he threw quilts and pillows up in the air , got out and said , `` Now any one who likes , may drive ,"
and lay down by his fire , and slept till it was day.
Then said he , `` After all it is a pity , -- he is a handsome man"
The youth heard it , got up , and said , `` It has not come to that yet"
Then the King was astonished , but very glad , and asked how he had fared.
`` Very well indeed ,"
answered he ; `` one night is past , the two others will get over likewise"
`` No ,"
said he , `` it is all in vain.
If some one would but tell me"
When midnight came , an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard ; at first it was low , but it grew louder and louder.
Then it was quiet for awhile , and at length with a loud scream , half a man came down the chimney and fell before him.
`` Hollo !"
cried he , `` another half belongs to this.
This is too little !"
Then the uproar began again , there was a roaring and howling , and the other half fell down likewise.
`` Wait ,"
said he , `` I will just blow up the fire a little for thee"
When he had done that and looked round again , the two pieces were joined together , and a frightful man was sitting in his place.
`` That is no part of our bargain ,"
said the youth , `` the bench is mine"
The youth also wanted to play and said `` Hark you , can I join you ?"
`` Yes , if thou hast any money"
`` Money enough ,"
replied he , `` but your balls are not quite round"
Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round.
`` There , now , they will roll better !"
said he.
`` Hurrah ! Now it goes merrily !"
He played with them and lost some of his money , but when it struck twelve , everything vanished from his sight.
He lay down and quietly fell asleep.
Next morning the King came to inquire after him.
`` How has it fared with you this time ?"
asked he.
`` I have been playing at nine-pins ,"
he answered , `` and have lost a couple of farthings"
`` Hast thou not shuddered then ?"
`` Eh , what ?"
said he , `` I have made merry.
If I did but know what it was to shudder !"
The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly , `` If I could but shudder"
When it grew late , six tall men came in and brought a coffin.
Then said he , `` Ha , ha , that is certainly my little cousin , who died only a few days ago ,"
and he beckoned with his finger , and cried `` Come , little cousin , come"
They placed the coffin on the ground , but he went to it and took the lid off , and a dead man lay therein.
He felt his face , but it was cold as ice.
`` Stop ,"
said he , `` I will warm thee a little ,"
and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man 's face , but he remained cold.
As this also did no good , he thought to himself `` When two people lie in bed together , they warm each other ,"
and carried him to the bed , covered him over and lay down by him.
After a short time the dead man became warm too , and began to move.
Then said the youth , `` See , little cousin , have I not warmed thee ?"
The dead man , however , got up and cried , `` Now will I strangle thee"
`` What !"
said he , `` is that the way thou thankest me ? Thou shalt at once go into thy coffin again ,"
and he took him up , threw him into it , and shut the lid.
Then came the six men and carried him away again.
`` I can not manage to shudder ,"
said he.
`` I shall never learn it here as long as I live"
Then a man entered who was taller than all others , and looked terrible.
He was old , however , and had a long white beard.
`` Thou wretch ,"
cried he , `` thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder , for thou shalt die"
`` Not so fast ,"
replied the youth.
`` If I am to die , I shall have to have a say in it"
`` I will soon seize thee ,"
said the fiend.
`` Softly , softly , do not talk so big.
I am as strong as thou art , and perhaps even stronger"
`` We shall see ,"
said the old man.
`` If thou art stronger , I will let thee go -- come , we will try"
Then he led him by dark passages to a smith 's forge , took an axe , and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.
`` I can do better than that ,"
said the youth , and went to the other anvil.
The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on , and his white beard hung down.
Then the youth seized the axe , split the anvil with one blow , and struck the old man 's beard in with it.
`` Now I have thee ,"
said the youth.
`` Now it is thou who will have to die"
Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop , and he would give him great riches.
The youth drew out the axe and let him go.
The old man led him back into the castle , and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold.
`` Of these ,"
said he , `` one part is for the poor , the other for the king , the third is thine"
In the meantime it struck twelve , and the spirit disappeared ; the youth , therefore , was left in darkness.
`` I shall still be able to find my way out ,"
said he , and felt about , found the way into the room , and slept there by his fire.
Next morning the King came and said `` Now thou must have learned what shuddering is ?"
`` No ,"
`` Then ,"
said the King , `` thou hast delivered the castle , and shalt marry my daughter"
`` That is all very well ,"
said he , `` but still I do not know what it is to shudder"
And at last she was angry at this.
Her waiting-maid said , `` I will find a cure for him ; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder"
She went out to the stream which flowed through the garden , and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to her.
YOUR name with ev ` ry pleasure here I place , The last effusions of my muse to grace.
Most willingly your lover I 'd have been ; But time it is our story should be seen.
The monarch , as he passed , desired to know The cause that sent each shade to realms below.
Some said -- my HUSBAND ; others WIFE replied ; The same was echoed loud from ev ` ry side.
BEHOLD him trav ` lling o ` er th ' extensive space ; Between the realms of darkness and our race.
His heart was soon the object of the FAIR ; To please Belphegor was their constant care.
WHO lib ` rally with presents smoothes the road , Will meet no obstacles to LOVE 'S abode.
No other choice Belphegor now had got , Than -- try himself the hymeneal knot.
This approbation met , and Rod ` rick ` gan To use his arts and execute his plan.
The heart alone can tranquilize the mind ; In mutual passion ev ` ry bliss we find.
We daily see from DUTY springs disgust , And PLEASURE likes true LIBERTY to trust.
WELL might this spouse regret his Hell profound , When he considered what he 'd met on ground.
His utter ruin , howsoe'er , arose From his attorney-steward that he chose.
'Twas said our husband never would succeed ; And truly , such it seemed to be decreed.
But all in vain : -- the man they took by force ; Proceed he must , or hanged he 'd be of course.
Sire , said the demon , it is clearly true , Damnation does the marriage knot pursue.
\* By this character La Fontaine is supposed to have meant his own wife"
His club the other to a spindle changed , To please the belle with whom he often ranged.
The flame she durst declare no other way , Than by those sighs , which feelings oft betray.
Till then , nor shame nor aught could her retain ; Now all was changed : -- her bashfulness was plain.
As none , howe'er , could think the subtle flame Would lie concealed with such a haughty dame , Camillus nothing of the kind supposed.
Though she incessantly by looks disclosed , That something unrevealed disturbed the soul , And o ` er her mind had absolute control.
TO this harangue the wary youth replied In truth , fair lady , I could ne'er decide , To criticise what others round may do.
To person_0 this a thunder-clap appeared ; Howe'er , she in her purpose persevered.
From what you 've said , and what your looks express To please your sight , no charms I now possess.
To be confused the wily stripling feigned , And like a statue for a time remained.
AT length he said : -- I know not what to do ; Undressing , by myself , I ca n't pursue.
BETWEEN the clothes in haste Camillus flew , Without inviting person_0 to pursue.
She thought at first he meant to try her love ; But raillery , this conduct was above.
person_0 Unlace me then , I pray.
Camillus I can not : I 'm undressed , and cold as clay : Unlace yourself.
TO this fair person_0 answered not a word , Which showed , with him , her sentiments concurred.
You ask the cause , and signs of doubt betray : Who TRULY loves , the same will ever say"
Now , worthy friend , you god-father shall stand ; This very day pray take the thing in hand.
THE whole arrangement Nicia much approved ; But now 'twas time the lady should be moved.
LUCRETIA howsoe'er the lad approved ; His winning manners much her favor moved.
The foll ` wing days our youthful am ` rous pair Found opportunities for pleasing fare.
The husband scarcely could himself contain , So anxiously he wished his aim to gain.
PRAY recollect my very life 's at stake , And do not many difficulties make.
Convince thereby how much your spouse you love ; ` Twill pleasure doubtless give the pow ` rs above.
But there was no necessity for this ; ` Tis pretty clear that nothing went amiss.
So plausible this prophet 's tale appeared , Each word he dropt was thoroughly revered.
Whence this delusion ? -- DRINK deranged the mind ; And , reason drowned , to madness they resigned.
THEN back they bore them motionless to sleep , And wake with wishes further joys to reap.
These circumstances I 've minutely told , To show , our tale was known in days of old.
The holy father then was always prone , To send the servants off and be alone.
BY means of opiate powders , much renowned , The friar plunged him in a sleep profound.
What 's here ? cried he : is ` t sleep , or is it death ; Some charm or spell perhaps withdraws their breath.
WE , must not doubt , he often offered prayers , To ease the culprit 's sufferings and cares.
Repent , I say : -- the other this desired , Though scarcely he could tell what was required.
MEANWHILE the prelate with the fav ` rite dame , No time to lose , made ev ` ry hour the same.
A THING so strange filled numbers with surprise , Who scarcely would believe their ears and eyes.
ONE day , to William 's castle as he moved.
TO their proposal person_0 soon agreed , And they resolved together to proceed.
But rarely I neglect so good a thing , That ills averts , and may such blessings bring.
And have you clearly said it , sir , to day ? Cried one of those he met upon his way.
Yes , person_0 answered.
Well , replied the Wight ; I 'll wage , I 'm better lodged than you to-night.
'TWAS very cold , and darkness ` gan to peep ; The place was distant yet , where they might sleep.
Perhaps , said person_0 , ` tis your usual care , In traveling , to say , like me , this prayer.
Our Wight might then have thoroughly perceived , His horse was lost -- no chance to be relieved.
MEANWHILE , however , while thus the lady sought.
His want of dress and miserable state Raised shame indeed , and showed distress was great.
Though LOVE be seen in Nature 's pure array , No dirt appears , however you survey.
THIS servant girl now hastened to the fair , And ev ` ry circumstance detailed with care.
Unasked , the stranger this attention got , And well perfumed ere clothes they would allot.
When dressed , he waited on the widow fair , And paid his compliments with graceful air.
THE supper -LRB- for the marquis first designed -RRB- At length was served with taste the most refined.
On ev ` ry side assailed the youthful dame Herself surrendered unto Cupid 's flame.
Should I give way , said she , who 'll tell the tale ? No risk is run if secrecy prevail.
The marquis merits to be played the trick ; He no excuse can have , unless he 's sick.
One sin against another I may weigh , And man for man will equally repay.
THE silence first was broken by the dame ; Who spoke so freely , person_0 bolder came.
The widow smiled ; enough it seems was said ; And person_0 shortened -- what to nothing led.
Now easy conversation was renewed ; Then mutual kisses ; ev ` ry sweet pursued.
His fortune to complete , that day they took The very wretches that he wished to hook.
Who seeks redress by law , facts oft have shown , May bless his stars if he but keep his own.
The waste was surrounded by a large forest , and every morning the old woman took her crutch and hobbled into it.
Any one would have thought that the heavy load would have weighed her to the ground , but she always brought it safely home.
If any one met her , she greeted him quite courteously.
`` Good day , dear countryman , it is a fine day.
Ah ! you wonder that I should drag grass about , but every one must take his burthen on his back"
She has claws beneath her gloves ; she is a witch"
One morning , a handsome young man was going through the forest.
The sun shone bright , the birds sang , a cool breeze crept through the leaves , and he was full of joy and gladness.
He had as yet met no one , when he suddenly perceived the old witch kneeling on the ground cutting grass with a sickle.
She had already thrust a whole load into her cloth , and near it stood two baskets , which were filled with wild apples and pears.
`` But , good little mother ,"
said he , `` how canst thou carry all that away ?"
`` I must carry it , dear sir ,"
`` Will you help me ?"
she said , as he remained standing by her.
`` You have still a straight back and young legs , it would be a trifle to you.
Besides , my house is not so very far from here , it stands there on the heath behind the hill.
How soon you would bound up thither"
The young man took compassion on the old woman.
`` My father is certainly no peasant ,"
`` If you will try it ,"
said she , `` I shall be very glad.
You will certainly have to walk for an hour , but what will that signify to you ; only you must carry the apples and pears as well ?"
`` See , it is quite light ,"
said she.
`` No , it is not light ,"
answered the count , and pulled a rueful face.
He had a mind to put everything down again , but the old woman would not allow it.
`` Just look ,"
said she mockingly , `` the young gentleman will not carry what I , an old woman , have so often dragged along.
You are ready with fine words , but when it comes to be earnest , you want to take to your heels.
Why are you standing loitering there ?"
she continued.
`` Step out.
No one will take the bundle off again"
The drops of perspiration stood on his forehead , and ran , hot and cold , down his back.
`` Dame ,"
said he , `` I can go no farther.
I want to rest a little"
`` Not here ,"
answered the old woman , `` when we have arrived at our journey 's end , you can rest ; but now you must go forward.
Who knows what good it may do you ?"
`` Old woman , thou art becoming shameless !"
He turned and twisted , but he could not get rid of it.
The old woman laughed at this , and sprang about quite delighted on her crutch.
`` Do n't get angry , dear sir ,"
said she , `` you are growing as red in the face as a turkey-cock ! Carry your bundle patiently.
I will give you a good present when we get home"
What could he do ? He was obliged to submit to his fate , and crawl along patiently behind the old woman.
She seemed to grow more and more nimble , and his burden still heavier.
Groaning continually , he climbed the mountain , and at length reached the old woman 's house , when he was just about to drop.
When the geese perceived the old woman , they flapped their wings , stretched out their necks , ran to meet her , cackling all the while.
Behind the flock walked , stick in hand , an old wench , strong and big , but ugly as night.
`` Good mother ,"
said she to the old woman , `` has anything happened to you , you have stayed away so long ?"
`` By no means , my dear daughter ,"
The way , too , has not seemed long to us ; we have been merry , and have been cracking jokes with each other all the time"
You have fairly earned your wages , and they shall not be wanting"
The count knew not whether to laugh or to cry.
`` Such a sweetheart as that ,"
thought he , `` could not touch my heart , even if she were thirty years younger"
In the meantime the old woman stroked and fondled her geese as if they were children , and then went into the house with her daughter.
The youth lay down on the bench , under a wild apple-tree.
`` It is quite delightful here ,"
said he , `` but I am so tired that I can not keep my eyes open ; I will sleep a little.
If only a gust of wind does not come and blow my legs off my body , for they are as rotten as tinder"
When he had slept a little while , the old woman came and shook him till he awoke.
`` Sit up ,"
said she , `` thou canst not stay here ; I have certainly treated thee hardly , still it has not cost thee thy life.
Of money and land thou hast no need , here is something else for thee"
Thereupon she thrust a little book into his hand , which was cut out of a single emerald.
`` Take great care of it ,"
said she , `` it will bring thee good fortune"
When he was already some way off , he still heard in the distance the noisy cry of the geese.
For three days the count had to wander in the wilderness before he could find his way out.
The count fell on one knee , drew the emerald book out of his pocket , and laid it at the Queen 's feet.
She bade him rise and hand her the little book.
Hardly , however , had she opened it , and looked therein , than she fell as if dead to the ground.
I had three daughters , the youngest of whom was so beautiful that the whole world looked on her as a wonder.
She was as white as snow , as rosy as apple-blossom , and her hair as radiant as sun-beams.
When she cried , not tears fell from her eyes , but pearls and jewels only.
When she was fifteen years old , the King summoned all three sisters to come before his throne.
You all love me , but the one of you who loves me best , shall fare the best"
Each of them said she loved him best.
`` Can you not express to me ,"
said the King , `` how much you do love me , and thus I shall see what you mean ?"
The eldest spoke.
`` I love my father as dearly as the sweetest sugar"
The second , `` I love my father as dearly as my prettiest dress"
But the youngest was silent.
Then the father said , `` And thou , my dearest child , how much dost thou love me ?"
`` I do not know , and can compare my love with nothing"
But her father insisted that she should name something.
So she said at last , `` The best food does not please me without salt , therefore I love my father like salt"
We all begged and prayed for her , said the Queen , `` but the King 's anger was not to be appeased.
How she cried when she had to leave us ! The whole road was strewn with the pearls which flowed from her eyes.
The King soon afterwards repented of his great severity , and had the whole forest searched for the poor child , but no one could find her.
You must tell me how you came by that pearl"
The King and the Queen resolved to seek out the old woman.
They thought that there where the pearl had been , they would obtain news of their daughter.
The old woman was sitting in that lonely place at her spinning-wheel , spinning.
It was already dusk , and a log which was burning on the hearth gave a scanty light.
All at once there was a noise outside , the geese were coming home from the pasture , and uttering their hoarse cries.
Soon afterwards the daughter also entered.
But the old woman scarcely thanked her , and only shook her head a little.
The daughter sat down beside her , took her spinning-wheel , and twisted the threads as nimbly as a young girl.
Thus they both sat for two hours , and exchanged never a word.
At last something rustled at the window , and two fiery eyes peered in.
It was an old night-owl , which cried , `` Uhu !"
three times.
She rose and went out , and where did she go ? Over the meadows ever onward into the valley.
She removed a skin which covered her face , then bent down to the well , and began to wash herself.
Her eyes shone out as brightly as the stars in heaven , and her cheeks bloomed a soft red like apple-blossom.
But the fair maiden was sad.
She sat down and wept bitterly.
One tear after another forced itself out of her eyes , and rolled through her long hair to the ground.
She sprang up like a roe which has been overtaken by the shot of the hunter.
She ran back home , trembling like an aspen-leaf.
She led her into the room and lighted a new log.
she said to the girl.
`` But , mother ,"
said the maiden , `` why do you begin work at so late an hour ? What do you expect ?"
`` Dost thou know then what time it is ?"
asked the old woman.
`` Not yet midnight ,"
answered the maiden , `` but already past eleven o'clock"
`` Dost thou not remember ,"
continued the old woman , `` that it is three years to-day since thou camest to me ? Thy time is up , we can no longer remain together"
I have always done as you bade me , and you have always been satisfied with me ; do not send me away"
The old woman would not tell the maiden what lay before her.
`` My stay here is over ,"
she said to her , `` but when I depart , house and parlor must be clean : therefore do not hinder me in my work.
Have no care for thyself , thou shalt find a roof to shelter thee , and the wages which I will give thee shall also content thee"
`` But tell me what is about to happen ,"
the maiden continued to entreat.
`` I tell thee again , do not hinder me in my work.
The count had strayed away from them in the wood by night , and had to walk onwards alone.
Next day it seemed to him that he was on the right track.
When the moon illumined the surrounding country he perceived a figure coming down the mountain.
`` Oho ,"
cried he , `` there she comes , and if I once get hold of one of the witches , the other shall not escape me !"
He hardly dared to breathe , but stretched his head as far forward through the leaves as he dared , and stared at her.
Hardly had she disappeared , before the count descended from the tree , and hastened after her with nimble steps.
He had not been gone long before he saw , in the twilight , two figures coming over the meadow.
The count told them what wonderful things he had seen by the well , and they did not doubt that it had been their lost daughter.
They walked onwards full of joy , and soon came to the little house.
The geese were sitting all round it , and had thrust their heads under their wings and were sleeping , and not one of them moved.
The King and Queen looked in at the window , the old woman was sitting there quite quietly spinning , nodding her head and never looking round.
The room was perfectly clean , as if the little mist men , who carry no dust on their feet , lived there.
Their daughter , however , they did not see.
They gazed at all this for a long time , at last they took heart , and knocked softly at the window.
The old woman appeared to have been expecting them ; she rose , and called out quite kindly , `` Come in , -- I know you already"
You , however , have been sufficiently punished by the misery in which you have lived"
Then she went to the chamber and called , `` Come out , my little daughter"
The King said , `` My dear child , I have given away my kingdom , what shall I give thee ?"
`` She needs nothing ,"
said the old woman.
When the old woman had said that , she disappeared from their sight.
The story goes still further , but my grandmother , who related it to me , had partly lost her memory , and had forgotten the rest.
This much is certain , that the old woman was no witch , as people thought , but a wise woman , who meant well.
Very likely it was she who , at the princess 's birth , gave her the gift of weeping pearls instead of tears.
That does not happen now-a-days , or else the poor would soon become rich"
Hill and vale do not come together , but the children of men do , good and bad.
In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other in their travels.
The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of enjoyment.
The shoemaker took a very hearty drink , and the storm on his face began to clear away.
Shall we travel together ?"
`` All right ,"
answered the tailor , `` if only it suits you to go into a big town where there is no lack of work"
`` That is just where I want to go ,"
answered the shoemaker.
`` In a small nest there is nothing to earn , and in the country , people like to go barefoot"
They traveled therefore onwards together , and always set one foot before the other like a weasel in the snow.
Both of them had time enough , but little to bite and to break.
When he again fell in with the shoemaker , the tailor had always the most in his bundle.
The ill-tempered shoemaker made a wry face , and thought , `` The greater the rascal the more the luck ,"
but the tailor began to laugh and to sing , and shared all he got with his comrade.
When they had traveled for some time , they came to a great forest through which passed the road to the capital.
They seated themselves beneath an oak-tree , and took counsel together how they should forecast , and for how many days they should provide themselves with bread.
The shoemaker said , `` One must look before one leaps , I will take with me bread for a week"
`` What !"
said the tailor , `` drag bread for seven days on one 's back like a beast of burden , and not be able to look about.
Besides , why should we not find the right way ? Bread for two days , and that 's enough"
Each , therefore , bought his own bread , and then they tried their luck in the forest.
It was as quiet there as in a church.
No wind stirred , no brook murmured , no bird sang , and through the thickly-leaved branches no sunbeam forced its way.
The shoemaker spoke never a word , the heavy bread weighed down his back until the perspiration streamed down his cross and gloomy face.
In the meantime he did not lose courage , but relied on God and on his luck.
In short he was pitiless.
The tailor called to remembrance what his mother had formerly said to him when he had been eating secretly in the pantry.
`` Eat what one can , and suffer what one must"
But on the sixth day , hunger made itself felt again , and gnawed him almost to the heart.
When times were good with me , I shared what I had with thee.
My trade is of that kind that each stitch must always be exactly like the other.
If I no longer have my eyes and can sew no more I must go a-begging.
At any rate do not leave me here alone when I am blind , or I shall die of hunger"
The shoemaker , however , who had driven God out of his heart , took the knife and put out his left eye.
Then he gave him a bit of bread to eat , held out a stick to him , and drew him on behind him.
When the sun went down , they got out of the forest , and before them in the open country stood the gallows.
Thither the shoemaker guided the blind tailor , and then left him alone and went his way.
Weariness , pain , and hunger made the wretched man fall asleep , and he slept the whole night.
When day dawned he awoke , but knew not where he lay.
Two poor sinners were hanging on the gallows , and a crow sat on the head of each of them.
Then one of the men who had been hanged began to speak , and said , `` Brother , art thou awake ?"
`` Yes , I am awake ,"
answered the second.
`` Then I will tell thee something ,"
If blind people did but know this , how many would regain their sight who do not believe that to be possible"
Immediately was fulfilled what the man on the gallows had said , and a couple of healthy new eyes filled the sockets.
He could distinguish every leaf on the trees , saw the birds which flew past , and the midges which danced in the air.
He threw himself on his knees , thanked God for the mercy he had shown him , and said his morning prayer.
He did not forget also to pray for the poor sinners who were hanging there swinging against each other in the wind like the pendulums of clocks.
Then he took his bundle on his back and soon forgot the pain of heart he had endured , and went on his way singing and whistling.
The first thing he met was a brown foal running about the fields at large.
He caught it by the mane , and wanted to spring on it and ride into the town.
The foal , however , begged to be set free.
`` I am still too young ,"
it said , `` even a light tailor such as thou art would break my back in two let me go till I have grown strong.
A time may perhaps come when I may reward thee for it"
`` Run off ,"
said the tailor , `` I see thou art still a giddy thing"
But the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before.
`` The sun to be sure fills my eyes ,"
said he , `` but the bread does not fill my mouth.
The first thing that comes across me and is even half edible will have to suffer for it"
In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow towards him.
`` Halt , halt !"
cried the tailor , and seized him by the leg.
`` I do n't know if thou art good to eat or not , but my hunger leaves me no great choice.
I must cut thy head off , and roast thee"
`` Do n't do that ,"
replied the stork ; `` I am a sacred bird which brings mankind great profit , and no one does me an injury.
Leave me my life , and I may do thee good in some other way"
`` Well , be off , Cousin Longlegs ,"
said the tailor.
The stork rose up , let its long legs hang down , and flew gently away.
`` What 's to be the end of this ?"
said the tailor to himself at last , `` my hunger grows greater and greater , and my stomach more and more empty.
Whatsoever comes in my way now is lost"
At this moment he saw a couple of young ducks which were on a pond come swimming towards him.
`` You come just at the right moment ,"
said he , and laid hold of one of them and was about to wring its neck.
`` Canst thou not imagine ,"
said she , `` how thy mother would mourn if any one wanted to carry thee off , and give thee thy finishing stroke ?"
`` Only be quiet ,"
said the good-tempered tailor , `` thou shalt keep thy children ,"
and put the prisoner back into the water.
`` There I shall at once find the reward of my good deed ,"
said the tailor , `` the honey will refresh me"
But if thou wilt leave us in peace and go thy way , we will do thee a service for it another time"
The little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done.
`` Three dishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner !"
When he was satisfied he said , `` Now I will get to work"
He went round the town , sought a master , and soon found a good situation.
`` I can go no further in skill ,"
said he , `` and yet things improve every day"
At last the King appointed him court-tailor.
But how things do happen in the world ! On the very same day his former comrade the shoemaker also became court-shoemaker.
When the latter caught sight of the tailor , and saw that he had once more two healthy eyes , his conscience troubled him.
`` Before he takes revenge on me ,"
thought he to himself , `` I must dig a pit for him"
He , however , who digs a pit for another , falls into it himself.
`` That would please me very much ,"
`` Oho !"
thought the tailor , `` a rogue gives more than he has got.
replied the tailor , and told her his fate.
`` If that be all ,"
said the duck , `` we can help thee.
The crown fell into the water , and lies down below at the bottom ; we will soon bring it up again for thee.
In the meantime just spread out thy handkerchief on the bank"
They swam to the shore and put the crown on the handkerchief.
No one can imagine how magnificent the crown was ; when the sun shone on it , it gleamed like a hundred thousand carbuncles.
The tailor thought , `` It gets worse and worse ! No one can endure that ?"
and threw his bundle on his back , and went forth.
When he came to the hollow tree , he sat down and hung his head.
answered the tailor , `` something quite different weighs me down ,"
and he told her what the King had demanded of him.
Then they hurried back and modelled the palace in wax with such rapidity that any one looking on would have thought it was growing before his eyes.
`` The time has come ,"
it said to the tailor , `` when I can repay thee for thy good deed.
I know already what is needful to thee , but thou shalt soon have help ; get on me , my back can carry two such as thou"
It galloped as quick as lightning thrice round it , and at the third time it fell violently down.
When the King saw that he arose in amazement , and went and embraced the tailor in the sight of all men.
But good fortune did not last long.
The King had daughters in plenty , one still prettier than the other , but he had no son.
He has now boasted that if he liked , he could cause a son to be brought to the Lord king through the air"
`` The reward is indeed great ,"
He went home , seated himself cross-legged on his work-table , and thought over what was to be done.
`` It ca n't be managed ,"
cried he at last , `` I will go away ; after all I ca n't live in peace here"
He tied up his bundle and hurried away to the gate.
When he got to the meadow , he perceived his old friend the stork , who was walking backwards and forwards like a philosopher.
Sometimes he stood still , took a frog into close consideration , and at length swallowed it down.
The stork came to him and greeted him.
`` I see ,"
he began , `` that thou hast thy pack on thy back.
Why art thou leaving the town ?"
The tailor told him what the King had required of him , and how he could not perform it , and lamented his misfortune.
`` Do n't let thy hair grow gray about that ,"
said the stork , `` I will help thee out of thy difficulty.
Go home and be easy.
In nine days from this time repair to the royal palace , and there will I come"
The little tailor went home , and at the appointed time was at the castle.
It was not long before the stork came flying thither and tapped at the window.
The tailor opened it , and cousin Longlegs came carefully in , and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble pavement.
He had , moreover , a baby in his beak that was as lovely as an angel , and stretched out its little hands to the Queen.
The stork laid it in her lap , and she caressed it and kissed it , and was beside herself with delight.
Before the stork flew away , he took his traveling bag off his back and handed it over to the Queen.
In it there were little paper parcels with colored sweetmeats , and they were divided amongst the little princesses.
The eldest , however , had none of them , but got the merry tailor for a husband.
`` It seems to me ,"
said he , `` just as if I had won the highest prize.
My mother was if right after all , she always said that whoever trusts in God and only has good luck , can never fail"
The road to the forest led him to the gallows.
Worn out with anger , rage , and the heat of the day , he threw himself down.
In his madness he ran into the forest and must have died there of hunger , for no one has ever either seen him again or heard of him"
`` If you want to know ,"
said the mother , `` seek it for yourself ,"
and the daughter added , `` If you are afraid you will not find it , take a guide with you"
But the step-daughter said , `` Poor man , I will take you there , come with me"
Then said the maiden , `` I should like to be as beautiful and fair as the sun ,"
and instantly she was white and fair as day.
`` Then I should like to have a purse of money which would never grow empty"
That the Lord gave her also , but he said , `` Do not forget what is best of all"
Said she , `` For my third wish , I desire , after my death , to inhabit the eternal kingdom of Heaven"
That also was granted unto her , and then the Lord left her.
The step-daughter , however , had a brother called Reginer , whom she loved much , and she told him all that had happened.
Then she answered , `` But , I pray thee , let no one see the picture"
Every day he went and stood before the picture , and thanked God for the happiness of having such a dear sister.
`` Be quiet ,"
said the old woman , `` I will soon divert it to you ,"
The bride asked , `` What is my dear brother saying ?"
`` Ah ,"
said the old woman , `` he says that you ought to take off your golden dress and give it to your sister"
Then she took it off , and put it on the black maiden , who gave her in exchange for it a shabby gray gown.
The bride asked , `` What is my dear brother saying ?"
`` Ah ,"
said the old woman , `` he says that you ought to take off your golden hood and give it to your sister"
So she took off the hood and put it on her sister , and sat with her own head uncovered.
And they drove on farther.
The bride asked , `` What is my dear brother saying ?"
`` Ah ,"
said the old woman , `` he says you must look out of the carriage"
They were , however , just on a bridge , which crossed deep water.
At the same moment that she sank , a snow-white duck arose out of the mirror-smooth water , and swam down the river.
The brother had observed nothing of it , and drove the carriage on until they reached the court.
The kitchen-boy did it , and lighted a fire on the hearth.
Then came the duck and sat down by it , and shook herself and smoothed her feathers to rights with her bill.
While she was thus sitting and enjoying herself , she asked , `` What is my brother Reginer doing ?"
The scullery-boy replied , `` He is imprisoned in the pit with adders and with snakes"
Then she asked , `` What is the black witch doing in the house ?"
The boy answered , `` She is loved by the King and happy"
`` May God have mercy on him ,"
said the duck , and swam forth by the sink.
The next night she came again and put the same questions , and the third night also.
Then the kitchen-boy could bear it no longer , and went to the King and discovered all to him.
All of which was done to her , and to her black daughter.
But the King married the white and beautiful bride , and rewarded her faithful brother , and made him a rich and distinguished man"
So the four brothers took their sticks , bade their father farewell , and went through the town-gate together.
When they had traveled about for some time , they came to a cross-way which branched off in four different directions.
he replied.
Then the other said , `` Come with me , and be a thief"
`` No ,"
he answered , `` that is no longer regarded as a reputable trade , and the end of it is that one has to swing on the gallows"
`` Oh ,"
The second brother met a man who put the same question to him what he wanted to learn in the world.
`` I do n't know yet ,"
he replied.
`` Then come with me , and be an astronomer ; there is nothing better than that , for nothing is hid from you"
A huntsman took the third brother into training , and gave him such excellent instruction in everything which related to huntsmanship , that he became an experienced hunter.
The youngest brother also met a man who spoke to him , and inquired what his intentions were.
`` Would you not like to be a tailor ?"
said he.
`` Not that I know of ,"
said the youth ; `` sitting doubled up from morning till night , driving the needle and the goose backwards and forwards , is not to my taste"
`` Oh , but you are speaking in ignorance ,"
So he let himself be persuaded , and went with the man , and learned his art from the very beginning.
`` So now ,"
said he , quite delighted , `` the wind has blown you back again to me"
They told him of all that had happened to them , and that each had learned his own trade.
The astronomer took his glass , looked up , and said , `` There are five"
Then the father said to the eldest , `` Fetch the eggs down without disturbing the bird which is sitting hatching them"
The huntsman aimed , and shot the eggs , all five as the father had desired , and that at one shot.
He certainly must have had some of the powder for shooting round corners.
`` Now it 's your turn ,"
The tailor brought his needle , and sewed them as his father wished.
`` Well ,"
I ca n't say which of you deserves the most praise.
That will be proved if you have but an early opportunity of using your talents"
Not long after this , there was a great uproar in the country , for the King 's daughter was carried off by a dragon.
The four brothers said to each other , `` This would be a fine opportunity for us to show what we can do !"
and resolved to go forth together and liberate the King 's daughter.
`` I will soon know where she is ,"
There the King 's daughter was sitting , and the dragon was lying asleep on her lap.
The huntsman said , `` I dare not fire , I should kill the beautiful maiden at the same time"
`` Then I will try my art ,"
The monster fell down dead , but was so large and powerful that his fall shattered the whole ship.
Fortunately , however , they laid hold of a couple of planks , and swam about the wide sea.
When the King once more saw his daughter , there were great rejoicings.
Then a warm contest arose among them , for each of them preferred his own claim.
The astronomer said , `` If I had not seen the princess , all your arts would have been useless , so she is mine"
The brothers were pleased with this decision , and said , `` It is better thus than that we should be at variance with each other"
Then each of them received half a kingdom , and they lived with their father in the greatest happiness as long as it pleased God"
We 'll properly equip you as a belle , And I will certainly reward you well.
TO gain but Phillis 's smiles , the Gascon said , He 'd with the very devil go to bed.
But no one coming , Eurilas , once more , Resumed his place , and ` gan again to snore.
AT length , before the sun his head had reared ; The door was opened , and a torch appeared.
A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow 's nest.
When they were fledged , some naughty boys pulled out the nest , but fortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind.
Little birds have to encounter great dangers !"
`` Ah , my son ,"
`` Yes , father , but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole with wax ?"
said the son.
`` Where hast thou seen that ?"
`` In a merchant 's garden ,"
said the youngster.
`` Oh , my son , merchant folks are quick folks ,"
said the father.
After this he asked the next , `` Where hast thou passed thy time ?"
`` At court ,"
said the son.
`` Yes , father ,"
said the son , `` but when the stable-boys make traps and fix their gins and snares in the straw , many a one is caught fast"
`` Where hast thou seen that ?"
said the old bird.
`` At court , among the stable-boys"
The father examined the third also : `` Where didst thou seek thy safety ?"
`` I have broken up tubs and ropes on the cart-roads and highways , and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley"
`` That is indeed dainty fare ,"
`` That is true ,"
said the son , `` but what if any one should carry a bit of rock , or ore , ready beforehand in his breast or pocket ?"
`` Where hast thou seen that ?"
`` Among the mountaineers , dear father ; when they go out , they generally take little bits of ore with them"
`` Mountain folks are working folks , and clever folks.
`` Where hast thou learned this ?"
The Father of all sparrows fed me all the summer through , and kept me from all mischance and from ferocious birds"
`` There ,"
he thought , `` I can surely be town-musician"
When he had walked some distance , he found a hound lying on the road , gasping like one who had run till he was tired.
`` What are you gasping so for , you big fellow ?"
asked the donkey.
`` Ah ,"
`` I tell you what ,"
said the donkey , `` I am going to Bremen , and shall be town-musician there ; go with me and engage yourself also as a musician.
I will play the lute , and you shall beat the kettledrum"
The hound agreed , and on they went.
asked the donkey.
`` Who can be merry when his neck is in danger ?"
answered the cat.
But now good advice is scarce.
Where am I to go ?"
`` Go with us to Bremen.
You understand night-music , you can be a town-musician"
The cat thought well of it , and went with them.
After this the three fugitives came to a farm-yard , where the cock was sitting upon the gate , crowing with all his might.
`` Your crow goes through and through one ,"
said the donkey.
`` What is the matter ?"
Now I am crowing at full pitch while I can"
`` Ah , but red-comb ,"
said the donkey , `` you had better come away with us.
The cock agreed to this plan , and all four went on together.
The donkey said , `` If so , we had better get up and go on , for the shelter here is bad"
The donkey , as the biggest , went to the window and looked in.
`` What do you see , my grey-horse ?"
asked the cock.
`` What do I see ?"
answered the donkey ; `` a table covered with good things to eat and drink , and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves"
`` That would be the sort of thing for us ,"
said the cock.
`` Yes , yes ; ah , how I wish we were there !"
said the donkey.
Then the animals took counsel together how they should manage to drive away the robbers , and at last they thought of a plan.
and ordered one of them to go and examine the house.
But the cat did not understand the joke , and flew in his face , spitting and scratching.
The cock , too , who had been awakened by the noise , and had become lively , cried down from the beam , `` Cock-a-doodle-doo !"
And the mouth of him who last told this story is still warm"
The lady fancied what the swain had said , Was policy , and to concealment led.

YE beauteous dames avoid the Sylvan shade ; Dread dangers solitary woods pervade"
In a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child , and three apprentices served under him.
Hans , however , went with them , and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep.
The two sharp ones waited until Hans had fallen asleep , then they got up , and went away leaving him where he was.
And they thought they had done a very clever thing , but it was certain to turn out ill for them.
When the sun arose , and Hans woke up , he was lying in a deep cavern.
He looked around on every side and exclaimed , `` Oh , heavens , where am I ?"
Whilst he was thus walking full of thought , he met a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly , `` Hans , where are you going ?"
`` Alas , thou canst not help me"
`` I well know your desire ,"
said the cat.
`` You wish to have a beautiful horse.
`` Well , this is a wonderful cat !"
thought Hans , `` but I am determined to see if she is telling the truth"
So she took him with her into her enchanted castle , where there were nothing but cats who were her servants.
They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs , and were merry and happy.
In the evening when they sat down to dinner , three of them had to make music.
When they had dined , the table was carried away , and the cat said , `` Now , Hans , come and dance with me"
`` No ,"
said he , `` I wo n't dance with a pussy cat.
I have never done that yet"
`` Then take him to bed ,"
said she to the cats.
`` That feels very soft !"
said Hans.
Once she said to him , `` Go and mow my meadow , and dry the grass ,"
and gave him a scythe of silver , and a whetstone of gold , but bade him deliver them up again carefully.
`` No ,"
said the cat , `` you must first do something more for me of the same kind.
There is timber of silver , carpenter 's axe , square , and everything that is needful , all of silver , with these build me a small house"
Then Hans built the small house , and said that he had now done everything , and still he had no horse.
Nevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six months.
The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses ? `` Yes ,"
said Hans.
So Hans set out , and she showed him the way to the mill.
They asked Hans where his horse was.
`` It will follow me in three days ' time"
Then they laughed and said , `` Indeed , stupid Hans , where wilt thou get a horse ?"
`` It will be a fine one !"
Then the King 's daughter said that they were to bring him immediately.
So they brought him out , and he had to hold his little smock-frock together to cover himself.
The servants unpacked splendid garments , and washed him and dressed him , and when that was done , no King could have looked more handsome.
`` And that is for the third miller 's boy ,"
said she.
`` Then he must have the mill ,"
After this , let no one ever say that anyone who is silly can never become a person of importance"
First Story.
Then the snake came in haste , and enjoyed its food.
The snake , however , only drank the milk , and left the bread-crumbs alone.
From that time forth , a change came over the child.
Second Story.
An orphan child was sitting on the town walls spinning , when she saw a snake coming out of a hole low down in the wall.
The girl took up the crown , it glittered and was of delicate golden filagree work.
If the girl had but left the crown where it was , the snake would certainly have brought still more of its treasures out of the hole.
Third Story.
A snake cries , `` Huhu , huhu"
A child says , `` Come out"
The snake comes out , then the child inquires about her little sister : `` Hast thou not seen little Red-stockings ?"
The snake says , `` No"
`` Neither have I"
`` Then I am like you.
Huhu , huhu , huhu"
So he remained standing a while , and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor.
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the doctor , `` that is soon managed"
`` What must I do ?"
asked the peasant.
and have that nailed up above thy house-door"
The peasant did everything that he had been told to do.
When he had doctored people awhile , but not long , a rich and great lord had some money stolen.
Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village , and must know what had become of the money.
Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money.
`` Oh , yes , but Grethe , my wife , must go too"
The lord was willing and let both of them have a seat in the carriage , and they all drove away together.
When they came to the nobleman 's castle , the table was spread , and Crabb was told to sit down and eat.
`` Yes , but my wife , Grethe , too ,"
said he , and he seated himself with her at the table.
meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish.
The servant , however , thought he intended by that to say , `` That is the first thief ,"
The second did not want to go in at all , but was forced.
So when he went in with his dish , the peasant nudged his wife , and said , `` Grethe , that is the second"
This servant was just as much alarmed , and he got out.
The third did not fare better , for the peasant again said , `` Grethe , that is the third"
The doctor looked at the dish , had no idea what to say , and cried , `` Ah , poor Crabb"
When the lord heard that , he cried , `` There ! he knows it , he knows who has the money !"
On this the servants looked terribly uneasy , and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment.
They led him to the spot where the money was concealed.
The fifth servant , however , crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more.
The Doctor , however , sat still and opened his A B C book , turned the pages backwards and forwards , and looked for the cock.
As he could not find it immediately he said , `` I know you are there , so you had better show yourself"
Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him , and full of terror , sprang out , crying , `` That man knows everything !"
Then Dr.
He knew not what to do , and , in his perplexity , he lay down and fell asleep.
Then he dreamt that he was to go outside the gate , and ask the first person who met him to be godfather.
Once the man thought he would visit the godfather , and tell him how he had succeeded with the water.
He asked them , `` Where does the godfather live ?"
The broom replied , `` One flight of stairs higher up"
When he came to the second flight , he saw a heap of dead fingers lying.
He asked , `` Where does the godfather live ?"
One of the fingers replied , `` One flight of stairs higher"
On the third flight lay a heap of dead heads , which again directed him to the flight beyond.
On the fourth flight , he saw fishes on the fire , which frizzled in the pans and baked themselves.
They , too , said , `` One flight of stairs higher"
When he opened the door and went in , the godfather got into bed in a great hurry and covered himself up.
`` How stupid you are !"
said the godfather.
`` That was the boy and the maid talking to each other"
`` But on the second flight I saw dead fingers lying"
`` Oh , how silly you are ! Those were some roots of scorzonera"
`` On the third flight lay a heap of dead men 's heads"
`` Foolish man , those were cabbages"
`` On the fourth flight , I saw fishes in a pan , which were hissing and baking themselves"
When he had said that , the fishes came and served themselves up.
`` Oh , that is a lie !"
The man became alarmed , and ran out , and if he had not , who knows what the godfather would have done to him"
Then he took his fiddle from his back , and played so that it echoed through the trees.
It was not long before a wolf came trotting through the thicket towards him.
`` Ah , here is a wolf coming ! I have no desire for him !"
said the musician ; but the wolf came nearer and said to him , `` Ah , dear musician , how beautifully thou dost play.
I should like to learn that , too"
`` It is soon learned ,"
the musician replied , `` thou hast only to do all that I bid thee"
`` Oh , musician ,"
said the wolf , `` I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master"
`` Look ,"
said the musician , `` if thou wilt learn to fiddle , put thy fore paws into this crevice"
`` Stay there until I come back again ,"
said the musician , and went his way.
and took his fiddle and again played in the forest.
It was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him.
`` Ah , there 's a fox coming !"
said the musician.
`` I have no desire for him"
The fox came up to him and said , `` Oh , dear musician , how beautifully thou dost play ! I should like to learn that too"
`` That is soon learned ,"
said the musician.
`` Thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee"
`` Oh , musician ,"
then said the fox , `` I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master"
`` Follow me ,"
The fox obeyed , and the musician fastened his paw to the left bough.
`` Little fox ,"
said he , `` now reach me thy right paw"
and he tied it to the right bough.
`` Wait there till I come back again ,"
said the musician , and went his way.
Again he said to himself , `` Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest , I will fetch hither another companion ,"
so he took his fiddle , and the sound echoed through the forest.
Then a little hare came springing towards him.
`` Why , a hare is coming ,"
said the musician , `` I do not want him"
`` Ah , dear musician ,"
said the hare , `` how beautifully thou dost fiddle ; I too , should like to learn that"
`` That is soon learned ,"
said the musician , `` thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee"
`` Oh , musician ,"
replied the little hare , `` I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master"
They went a part of the way together until they came to an open space in the forest , where stood an aspen tree.
The musician tied a long string round the little hare 's neck , the other end of which he fastened to the tree.
`` Now briskly , little hare , run twenty times round the tree !"
`` Wait there till I come back ,"
said the musician , and went onwards.
Full of anger and rage he hurried after the musician and wanted to tear him to pieces.
They found the tied-up hare , whom likewise they delivered , and then they all sought the enemy together.
The musician had once more played his fiddle as he went on his way , and this time he had been more fortunate.
`` At last comes the right companion ,"
said the musician , `` for I was seeking a human being , and no wild beast"
And he began and played so beautifully and delightfully that the poor man stood there as if bewitched , and his heart leaped with gladness.
Then the beasts were terrified and ran back into the forest.
The musician , however , played once more to the man out of gratitude , and then went onwards"
Then the fisherman answered , `` Of what use is a castle to me , if I have nothing to eat ?"
`` If that be true ,"
said the man , `` then I can well do you a favor"
`` Yes ,"
Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into the water , and went home.
But where his hovel had formerly stood , now stood a great castle.
`` Yes ,"
said the man , `` it suits me too , but I am frightfully hungry , just give me something to eat"
Said the wife , `` But I have got nothing and do n't know where to find anything in this new house"
`` There is no need of your knowing ,"
said the man , `` for I see yonder a great cupboard , just unlock it"
When she opened it , there stood cakes , meat , fruit , wine , quite a bright prospect.
Then the woman cried joyfully , `` What more can you want , my dear ?"
and they sat down , and ate and drank together.
When they had had enough , the woman said , `` But husband , whence come all these riches ?"
`` Alas ,"
`` Very good ,"
said she , `` if I am not to know anything , then I do not want to know anything"
But fortune would so have it , that he once more drew out the golden fish.
`` Listen ,"
`` I will take good care ,"
answered the fisherman , and threw the fish back into the water.
The man kept silence for a short time , but at last she made him so angry that he broke out , and betrayed the secret.
In an instant the castle disappeared , and they were back again in their old hut.
`` Now you have got what you want ,"
said he ; `` and we can gnaw at a bare bone again"
`` Ah ,"
said the woman , `` I had rather not have riches if I am not to know from whom they come , for then I have no peace"
The man went back to fish , and after a while he chanced to draw out the gold fish for a third time.
`` Listen ,"
The fisherman took the fish home with him , and did as it had bidden him.
It came to pass , however , that from the two pieces that were"
Supposing that she was dead , he rushed to the window and shrieked , `` Thieves thieves ! They have killed my wife"
The neighbors quickly gathered , and the servants came running upstairs to see what was the matter.
It happened that the woman had fainted , and that there was only a very slight wound in her breast where the arrow had grazed.
On hearing this the merchant went to the king , and told him what had taken place.
His Majesty was much enraged at such audacious wickedness , and swore that most terrible punishment should be visited on the offender if he could be discovered.
He ordered the merchant to go back and ascertain whether his wife could recognize the young men if she saw them again.
`` Oh yes ,"
replied the woman , `` I should know them again among all the people in the city"
`` Then ,"
A royal proclamation was issued to this effect.
They came to see the tamasha.
`` My own son and the son of my chief vizier !"
exclaimed the king , who had been present from the commencement.
`` What examples for the people ! Let them both be executed"
`` Not so , your Majesty ,"
said the vizier , `` I beseech you Let the facts of the case be thoroughly investigated.
How is it ?"
he continued , turning to the two young men.
`` Why have you done this cruel thing ?"
`` I shot an arrow at a bird that was sitting on the sill of an open window in yonder house , and missed ,"
answered the prince.
`` I suppose the arrow struck the merchant 's wife.
Had I known that she or anybody had been near I should not have shot in that direction"
`` We will speak of this later on ,"
said the king , on hearing this answer.
`` Dismiss the people.
Their presence is no longer needed"
In the evening his Majesty and the vizier had a long and earnest talk about their two sons.
The king wished both of them to be executed ; but the vizier suggested that the prince should be banished from the country.
This was finally agreed to.
Accordingly , on the following morning , a little company of soldiers escorted the prince out of the city.
When they reached the last custom - house the vizier 's son overtook them.
He had come with all haste , bringing with him four bags of muhrs on four horses.
`` I am come ,"
he said , throwing his arms round the prince 's neck , `` because I can not let you go alone.
We have lived together , we will be exiled together , and we will die together.
Turn me not back , if you love me"
`` Consider ,"
the prince answered , `` what you are doing.
All kinds of trial may be before me.
Why should you leave your home and country to be with me ?"
`` Because I love you ,"
he said , `` and shall never be happy without you"
On reaching a place on the borders of the king 's dominions the prince gave the soldiers some gold , and ordered them to return.
For some reason he was delayed ; perhaps the tsut was not quite ready , or the baniya had not got all the spices prepared.
After waiting half an hour the prince became impatient , and rose up and walked about.
The source was a beautiful lake , which at that time was covered with the magnificent lotus flower and other water plants.
The prince sat down on the bank , and being thirsty took up some of the water in his hand.
Again he saw the reflection in the water which was in his palm.
He looked around as before , and this time discovered a fairy sitting by the bank on the opposite side of the lake.
On seeing her he fell so madly in love with her that he dropped down in a swoon.
He waited a little while , and then shouted ; but not getting any reply , he got up and went to the brook.
There he came across the footmarks of his friend.
`` Alas ! alas !"
he cried , and lifting up the prince , he poured some water over his head and face.
`` Alas ! my brother , what is this ? Oh ! do not die and leave me thus.
Speak , speak ! I can not bear this !"
In a few minutes the prince , revived by the water , opened his eyes , and looked about wildly.
`` Thank God !"
exclaimed the vizier 's son.
`` But what is the matter , brother ?"
`` Go away ,"
replied the prince.
`` I do n't want to say anything to you , or to see you.
Go away"
`` Come , come ; let us leave this place.
Look , I have brought some food for you , and horses , and everything.
Let us eat and depart"
`` Go alone ,"
replied the prince.
`` Never ,"
said the vizier 's son.
`` What has happened to suddenly estrange you from me ? A little while ago we were brethren , but now you detest the sight of me"
`` I have looked upon a fairy ,"
the prince said.
`` But a moment I saw her face ; for when she noticed that I was looking at her she covered her face with lotus petals.
Oh , how beautiful she was ! And while I gazed she took out of her bosom an ivory box , and held it up to me.
Then I fainted.
Oh ! if you can get me that fairy for my wife , I will go anywhere with you"
`` Oh , brother ,"
said the vizier 's son , `` you have indeed seen a fairy.
She is a fairy of the fairies.
This is none other than person_0 of the Ivory City.
I know this from the signs that she gave you.
From her covering her face with lotus petals I learn her name , and from her showing you the ivory box I learn where she lives.
Be patient , and rest assured that I will arrange your marriage with her"
When the prince heard these encouraging words he felt much comforted , rose up , and ate , and then went away gladly with his friend.
On the way they met two men.
These two men belonged to a family of robbers.
There were eleven of them altogether.
The two men came forward , and , politely accosting them , begged them to come and stay at their house for the night.
`` It is late ,"
they said , `` and there is not another village within several miles"
`` Shall we accept this good man 's invitation , brother ?"
asked the prince.
It is very kind of you to ask us"
So they all four went to the robbers ' tower.
Seated in a room , with the door fastened on the outside , the two travellers bemoaned their fate.
`` It is no good groaning ,"
said the vizier 's son.
`` I will climb to the window , and see whether there are any means of escape.
Yes ! yes !"
he whispered , when he had reached the window-hole.
`` Below there is a ditch surrounded by a high wall.
I will jump down and reconnoitre.
You stay here , and wait till I return"
Presently he came back and told the prince that he had seen a most ugly woman , whom he supposed was the robbers ' housekeeper.
She had agreed to release them on the promise of her marriage with the prince.
So the woman led the way out of the enclosure by a secret door.
`` But where are the horses and the goods ?"
the vizier 's son inquired.
`` You can not bring them ,"
the woman said.
`` To go out by any other way would be to thrust oneself into the grave"
`` All right , then ; they also shall go out by this door.
I have a charm , whereby I can make them thin or fat"
The prince saw his opportunity , and in a moment was riding after him , having the woman behind him.
Now the robbers heard the galloping of the horses , and ran out and shot their arrows at the prince and his companions.
And one of the arrows killed the woman , so they had to leave her behind.
On , on they rode , until they reached a village where they stayed the night.
The following morning they were off again , and asked for Ivory City from every passer-by.
She agreed to let them stay there for a few days.
As soon as her work was over the old woman came and sat down with her lodgers.
The vizier 's son pretended to be utterly ignorant of the place and people.
`` Has this city a name ?"
he asked the old woman.
`` Of course it has , you stupid.
Every little village , much more a city , and such a city as this , has a name"
`` What is the name of this city ?"
`` Ivory City.
Do n't you know that ? I thought the name was known all over the world"
On the mention of the name Ivory City the prince gave a deep sigh.
The vizier 's son looked as much as to say `` Keep quiet , or you 'll discover the secret"
`` Is there a king of this country ?"
continued the vizier 's son.
`` Of course there is , and a queen , and a princess"
`` What are their names ?"
`` The name of the princess is person_0 , and the name of the queen --"
The vizier 's son interrupted the old woman by turning to look at the prince , who was staring like a madman.
`` Yes ,"
he said to him afterwards , `` we are in the right country.
We shall see the beautiful princess"
`` Who is coming ?"
said the vizier 's son.
`` Nobody ,"
the old woman replied.
`` Then where are you going ?"
`` I am going to see my daughter , who is a servant of the Princess person_0.
I see her and the princess every day.
I should have gone yesterday , if you had not been here and taken up all my time"
`` Ah-h-h ! Be careful not to say anything about us in the hearing of the princess"
On seeing her mother the girl pretended to be very angry.
`` Why have you not been for two days ?"
she asked.
`` Because , my dear ,"
It is nothing but cooking and cleaning , and cleaning and cooking , all day long.
I ca n't understand the men ,"
she added ; `` one of them especially appears very stupid.
He asked me the name of this country and the name of the king.
Now where can these men have come from , that they do not know these things ? However , they are very great and very rich.
They each give me a muhr every morning and every evening"
`` Alas ! alas !"
said the prince , who had eagerly listened to every word.
`` What , then , will be her anger at the sight of a man ?"
`` Anger ?"
said the vizier 's son , with an astonished air.
`` She would be exceedingly glad to see one man.
I know this.
In this treatment of the old woman I see her request that you will go and see her during the coming dark fortnight"
`` Heaven be praised !"
the prince exclaimed.
Now person_0 had obtained a charmed swing , that landed whoever sat on it at the place wherever they wished to be.
`` Get the swing ,"
she said to one of the servants standing by.
When it was brought she bade the old woman step into it and desire to be at home.
`` Oh !"
she cried , `` I thought that both of you would be killed by this time.
The royal elephants have got loose and are running about wildly.
When I heard this I was anxious about you.
So the princess gave me this charmed swing to return in.
But come , let us get outside before the elephants arrive and batter down the place"
`` Do n't believe this ,"
said the vizier 's son.
`` It is a mere hoax.
They have been playing tricks with you"
`` You will soon have your heart 's desire ,"
he whispered aside to the prince.
`` These things are signs"
Oh , what a happy meeting it was ! `` At last ,"
said person_0 , `` I have seen my beloved , my husband"
`` A thousand thanks to Heaven for bringing me to you ,"
said the prince.
Henceforth the prince visited person_0 every day and returned to the hut every night.
One morning person_0 begged him to stay with her always.
She could not live without seeing him.
person_0 for the time assented , but she determined in her heart to get rid of the vizier 's son as soon as possible.
A few days after this conversation she ordered one of her maids to make a pilaw.
On receiving the present the vizier 's son thought that the prince had spoken gratefully of him to the princess , and therefore she had thus remembered him.
Accordingly he sent back his salam and expressions of thankfulness.
When it was dinner-time he took the saucepan of pilaw and went out to eat it by the stream.
Taking off the lid , he threw it aside on the grass and then washed his hands.
During the minute or so that he was performing these ablutions , the green grass under the cover of the saucepan turned quite yellow.
The moment the crows ate what was thrown to them they fell down dead.
`` Heaven be praised ,"
exclaimed the vizier 's son , `` who has preserved me from death at this time !"
On the return of the prince that evening the vizier 's son was very reticent and depressed.
The prince noticed this change in him , and asked what was the reason.
`` Is it because I am away so much at the palace ?"
The vizier 's son saw that the prince had nothing to do with the sending of the pilaw , and therefore told him everything.
`` Look here ,"
he said , `` in this handkerchief is some pilaw that the princess sent me this morning in the name of her deceased uncle.
It is saturated with poison.
Thank Heaven , I discovered it in time !"
`` Oh , brother ! who could have done this thing ? Who is there that entertains enmity against you ?"
`` The Princess person_0.
Listen.
It will provoke tears , and person_0 will ask you why you are crying.
Tell her that you weep for the loss of your friend , who died suddenly this morning.
It is strong , and will immediately send her into a deep sleep.
Then , while she is asleep , heat the shovel and mark her back with it.
Remember to bring back the shovel again , and also to take her pearl necklace.
This done , return.
Now fear not to execute these instructions , because on the fulfilment of them depends your fortune and happiness.
I will arrange that your marriage with the princess shall be accepted by the king , her father , and all the court"
The prince promised that he would do everything as the vizier 's son had advised him ; and he kept his promise.
It was arranged that the vizier 's son should act the part of a fakir and the prince the part of the fakir 's disciple and servant.
She went at once and informed the king of the loss of her necklace , but said nothing to him about the pain in her back.
The king was very angry when he heard of the theft , and caused proclamation concerning it to be made throughout all the city and surrounding country.
`` It is well ,"
said the vizier 's son , when he heard of this proclamation.
`` Fear not , my brother , but go and take this necklace , and try to sell it in the bazaar"
The prince took it to a goldsmith and asked him to buy it.
`` How much do you want for it ?"
asked the man.
`` Fifty thousand rupees ,"
the prince replied.
`` All right ,"
said the man ; `` wait here while I go and fetch the money"
`` How did you get the necklace ?"
the kotwal asked.
`` A fakir , whose servant I am , gave it to me to sell in the bazaar ,"
the prince replied.
`` Permit me , and I will show you where he is"
Presently , when he had finished his devotions , the kotwal asked him to explain how he had obtained possession of the princess 's necklace.
`` Call the king hither ,"
he replied , `` and then I will tell his Majesty face to face"
On this some men went to the king and told him what the fakir had said.
`` Last night ,"
On seeing this I was filled with anger , and beat her back with a shovel , which lay on the fire at the time.
While running away from me her necklace got loose and dropped.
You wonder at these words , but they are not difficult to prove.
Examine your daughter , and you will find the marks of the burn on her back.
Go , and if it is as I say , send the princess to me , and I will punish her"
The king went back to the palace , and at once ordered the princess 's back to be examined.
`` It is so ,"
said the maid-servant ; `` the burn is there"
`` Then let the girl be slain immediately ,"
the king shouted.
`` No , no , your Majesty ,"
they replied.
`` Let us send her to the fakir who discovered this thing , that he may do whatever he wishes with her"
The king agreed , and so the princess was taken to the graveyard.
`` Let her be shut up in a cage , and be kept near the grave whence she took out the corpse ,"
said the fakir.
This was done , and in a little while the fakir and his disciple and the princess were left alone in the graveyard.
They released the princess , rubbed some ointment over the scars on her back , and then sat her upon one of their horses behind the prince.
Away they rode fast and far , and by the morning were able to rest and talk over their plans in safety.
The vizier 's son showed the princess some of the poisoned pilaw that she had sent him , and asked whether she had repented of her ingratitude.
The princess wept , and acknowledged that he was her greatest helper and friend.
When the vizier read the letter he went and informed the king.
Accordingly they did this ; the prince wrote the letter at the vizier 's son 's dictation.
He ordered the execution of some of the viziers on a certain date.
`` Come ,"
he wrote back to the vizier 's son , `` and stay at the palace.
And if the prince desires it , I will arrange for his marriage with person_0 as soon as possible"
The prince and the vizier 's son most gladly accepted the invitation , and received a right noble welcome from the king.
He agreed to do so , and succeeded in obtaining their pardon.
Henceforth all was sunshine on the path of the prince.
He became a great favorite , and in due time succeeded to the throne , and ruled the country for many , many years in peace and happiness"
The region round the little town of Kjoege is very bleak and bare.
But the eye of God watches over the little ones ; if it did not , they would be badly off.
Accordingly , he was famously jeered and mocked at , and had to bear the jeering and mockery as best he could.
From the time when little person_0 heard of this dream , he would no longer bear the teasing of the other boys.
He might go into the water now , he said , for person_1 had dreamed it.
He certainly never carried the idea into practice , but the dream was his great guide for all that.
The old willow tree in the garden was much handsomer , and therefore the children were fond of sitting under it.
Consequently there came a present of a bit of gingerbread every now and then , and of course person_1 received her share of the gift.
`` On the shop-board ,"
`` His thoughts were far more extravagant , as is always the case with a man.
So they lay on the shop-board for weeks and weeks , and grew dry and hard , but the thoughts of the maiden became ever more gentle and maidenly"
` It is enough for me that I have lived on the same table with him , ' she said , and crack ! she broke in two"
` If she had only known of my love , she would have kept together a little longer , ' he thought.
`` And that is the story , and here they are , both of them ,"
said the baker in conclusion.
`` They are remarkable for their curious history , and for their silent love , which never came to anything.
And there they are for you !"
It was called _ love _ because the story was so lovely , on that they all agreed.
But when they turned to look again at the gingerbread pair , a big boy , out of mischief , had eaten up the broken maiden.
The people of Kjoege , even to the rich wife of the fancy-shop keeper , stood still and listened when person_1 sang.
`` She has a very sweet voice , that little girl ,"
they said.
Those were glorious days , but they could not last for ever.
The neighbors were neighbors no longer.
And the neighbors separated regretfully , the children weeping heartily , but the parents promised that they should at least write to one another once a year.
Ah , how often his thoughts were with person_1 ! Did she think of him ? Yes.
The whole family wept : and yet all this was very pleasant ; those were joyful tears that they shed.
He ran the awl far into his finger , but he did not care for that.
He determined not to play the dumb lover , as the two gingerbread cakes had done : the story should teach him a lesson.
How glad person_1 would be ! She was now seventeen years old , and he nineteen.
The leaves were falling down from the trees , and he arrived at his new master 's in the metropolis wet to the skin.
Next Sunday he was to pay a visit to person_1 's father.
And he found the house he sought , and mounted flight after flight of stairs until he became almost giddy.
It was terrible to him to see how people lived piled up one over the other in the dreadful city.
Everything in the room had a prosperous look , and person_1 's father received him very kindly.
To the new wife he was a stranger , but she shook hands with him , and gave him some coffee.
`` person_1 will be glad to see you ,"
said the father : `` you have grown quite a nice young man.
You shall see her presently.
She is a girl who rejoices my heart , and , please God , she will rejoice it yet more.
She has her own room now , and pays us rent for it"
And the father knocked quite politely at the door , as if he were a visitor , and then they went in.
person_0 saw all this at a glance : and yet he saw nothing but person_1.
She was a grown maiden , quite different from what person_0 had fancied her , and much more beautiful.
In all Kjoege there was not a girl like her.
She did not really do so , but she came very near it.
No , she had not grown proud at all.
Yes , certainly she was fond of person_0.
That was an evening of matchless delight to person_0 ; to sleep after it was impossible , and accordingly person_0 did not sleep.
and therefore he could very well go again the next Sunday , and resolved to do so.
`` He is only a young fellow ,"
he said.
I know I am only a poor journeyman shoemaker , but I shall work and strive -- yes , I shall tell her so.
Nothing comes of silent love : I have learned that from the cakes"
person_1 pressed his hand and said , `` Have you ever been to the theater ? You must go once.
I shall sing on Wednesday , and if you have time on that evening , I will send you a ticket ; my father knows where your master lives"
And all the people shouted and applauded , and person_0 cried out `` hurrah !"
Even the king smiled at person_1 , and seemed to delight in her.
So soon as Sunday came , he went again.
He felt as if he were going into a church.
person_1 was alone , and received him -- it could not have happened more fortunately.
`` It is well that you are come ,"
she said.
It seemed to person_0 as if the whole room were whirling round and round with him.
`` You honest , faithful soul !"
she exclaimed ; and these words of hers loosened person_0 's tongue.
She let his hand fall , and answered , seriously and mournfully , `` person_0 , do not make yourself and me unhappy.
I shall always be a good sister to you , one in whom you may trust , but I shall never be anything more"
And she drew her white hand over his hot forehead.
`` Heaven gives us strength for much ,"
she said , `` if we only endeavor to do our best"
At that moment the stepmother came into the room ; and person_1 said quickly , `` person_0 is quite inconsolable because I am going away.
Come , be a man ,"
she continued , and laid her hand upon his shoulder ; and it seemed as if they had been talking of the journey , and nothing else.
`` You are a child ,"
she added ; `` but now you must be good and reasonable , as you used to be under the willow tree , when we were both children"
It had not the old tone , and yet it was wonderfully beautiful , and made his heart feel ready to burst.
And then they parted.
And she smiled through the tears that were rolling over her cheeks , and she repeated the word `` brother"
-- and certainly there was good consolation in that -- and thus they parted.
She sailed to France , and person_0 wandered about the muddy streets of Copenhagen.
And they went with him to the dancing-rooms.
`` Heaven gives us strength for a great deal , if we only try to do our best ,"
she had said ; and holy thoughts came into his mind , and he folded his hands.
The world went on its course , but person_0 pursued his lonely way , unheedingly.
The winter came , and the streams were frozen.
Everything seemed to be preparing for a burial.
Nuremberg is a wonderful old city , and looks as if it were cut out of an old picture-book.
The streets seem to stretch themselves along just as they please.
The houses do not like standing in regular ranks.
Here in the market-place stood person_0 , with his knapsack on his back.
The sunlight streamed in through the stained glass windows , between the two lofty slender pillars.
His spirit became prayerful , and peace returned to his soul.
And he sought and found a good master in Nuremberg , with whom he stayed , and in whose house he learned the German language.
Here he lived through a summer and a winter ; but when the spring came again he could bear it no longer.
His workshop was quite close to one of the old stone bridges , by a low water-mill , that rushed and foamed always.
Without , rolled the roaring stream , hemmed in by houses , whose old decayed gables looked ready to topple down into the water.
Yes , he had certainly gone from the `` Elder-mother"
to the `` Willow-father"
Nevertheless , he could not remain.
Why not ? Ask the willow tree , ask the blooming elder ! And therefore he bade farewell to his master in Nuremberg , and journeyed onward.
The strap of his knapsack seemed so tight across his chest that he could scarcely breathe ; he loosened it , but was not relieved.
He saw but half the world around him ; the other half he carried about him , and within himself.
And thus it stood with him.
sighed he , `` that the Last Day were come !"
Silently he wandered through the land , that seemed to him as an orchard covered with soft turf.
The mountains were a wall between him and all his recollections ; and he wished it to be so.
Before him lay a great glorious city which they called _ Milano _ , and here he found a German master who gave him work.
They were an old pious couple , in whose workshop he now labored.
To himself also it seemed as if Heaven had lifted the heavy burden from his heart.
It was as bright there as in the brilliant sunshine , and the music rolled gloriously through the building.
Poor person_0 seized his master 's hand , and called out aloud , `` person_1 !"
but no one heard but the master , who nodded his head , for the loud music sounded above everything.
`` Yes , yes , her name is person_1 ,"
said the master ; and he drew forth a printed playbill , and showed person_0 her name -- for the full name was printed there.
In the street the people crowded round her carriage , and drew it away in triumph.
person_0 looked straight into her face , and she looked into his , but she did not know him.
A man , with a star glittering on his breast , gave her his arm -- and it was whispered about that the two were engaged.
Then person_0 went home and packed his knapsack.
The old couple begged him to remain , but no words could induce him to stay.
So he went away towards the mountains , and marched up them and down them.
His strength was giving way , but still he saw no village , no house ; he marched on towards the north.
The stars gleamed above him , his feet stumbled , and his head grew dizzy.
Deep in the valley stars were shining too , and it seemed as if there were another sky below him.
He felt he was ill.
.
The stars below him became more and more numerous , and glowed brighter and brighter , and moved to and fro.
That night and the whole of the following day he remained there , for his body required rest and refreshment.
It was thawing ; there was rain in the valley.
But early on the second morning came a man with an organ , who played a tune of home ; and now person_0 could stay no longer.
It was evening.
He was walking on the public high-road.
The frost began to make itself felt , and the country soon became flatter , containing mere field and meadow.
By the road-side grew a great willow tree.
to him.
`` We thank you ,"
they said to person_0.
`` Our master first ,"
`` That was the most delicious hour of my life !"
he said , `` and it was but a dream.
Oh , let me dream again !"
And he closed his eyes once more , and slept and dreamed.
Towards morning there was a great fall of snow.
The wind drifted the snow over him , but he slept on.
The villagers came forth to go to church , and by the road-side sat a journeyman.
He was dead -- frozen to death under the willow tree !"
Some years have elapsed since the time of which we speak.
-- that is to say , it eats as much as it earns.
Jeppe-Jaens cultivated his field in summer.
They carved shoes and spoons , and that brought in money.
It would have been wronging the Jeppe-Jaenses to call them poor people.
person_1 had never been on the heath where person_0 's father lived , nor had he ever been on the river.
Next morning early , the two children were sitting high up on the pile of firewood in the boat , eating bread and whistleberries.
person_0 's father and his assistant propelled the boat with staves.
The water-lilies rocked themselves on the river.
But the children did not do that ; or at least they obeyed only for a very short time.
`` Take me with you !"
she cried.
And in a few minutes they were deep in the thicket , and could no longer see either the boat or the bank.
They ran on a little farther , and then person_0 fell down on the ground and began to cry ; but person_1 picked her up.
`` Follow me !"
he cried.
`` Yonder lies the house"
But the house was not yonder.
They wandered on and on , over the dry , rustling , last year 's leaves , and over fallen branches that crackled beneath their feet.
Soon they heard a loud piercing scream.
They stood still and listened , and presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood.
Now again they heard the cry they had heard before.
`` We shall get into trouble about the pig ,"
said person_0.
`` Come , let us go to our house ,"
said person_1 ; `` it is here in the wood"
-LRB- Illustration : IB AND CHRISTINE MEET THE GIPSY.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa And they went forward.
They presently came to a wood , but it did not lead them home ; and darkness came on , and they were afraid.
At last they both lost themselves in a thicket.
The sun was high in the heavens when the two children awoke.
But they were far away from the house in question , in quite another part of the forest.
They could see fish in great numbers in the pure water illumined by the sun 's rays.
But there was another surprise and another fright in store for them.
Out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman ; her face was quite brown , and her hair was deep black and shining.
She was a gipsy.
The children did not at once understand what she said.
And person_1 and person_0 looked at the wishing-nuts with great eyes.
`` Is there a carriage with a pair of horses in this nut ?"
he asked.
`` Yes , there 's a golden carriage with two horses ,"
answered the woman.
`` Then give me the nut ,"
said little person_0.
And person_1 gave it to her , and the strange woman tied it in her pocket-handkerchief for her.
`` Is there in this nut a pretty little neckerchief , like the one person_0 wears round her neck ?"
inquired person_1.
`` There are ten neckerchiefs in it ,"
answered the woman.
`` There are beautiful dresses in it , and stockings , and a hat with a veil"
`` Then I will have that one too ,"
cried little person_0.
And person_1 gave her the second nut also.
The third was a little black thing.
`` That one you can keep ,"
said person_0 ; `` and it is a pretty one too"
`` What is in it ?"
inquired person_1.
`` The best of all things for you ,"
replied the gipsy-woman.
And person_1 held the nut very tight.
But that is no reason why we should suspect the gipsy-woman of wanting to steal the children.
They were pardoned and forgiven , although they had indeed both deserved `` to get into trouble ;"
firstly , because they had let the sucking-pig fall into the water , and secondly , because they had run away.
person_0 was taken back to her father on the heath , and person_1 remained in the farmhouse on the margin of the wood by the great ridge.
The first thing he did in the evening was to bring forth out of his pocket the little black nut , in which `` the best thing of all"
was said to be enclosed.
The nut looked as if it were filled with tobacco or black rich earth ; it was what we call hollow , or worm-eaten.
`` Yes , that 's exactly what I thought ,"
said person_1.
And winter came on , and the new year began ; indeed , several years went by.
`` Only think ,"
he said ; `` she is going to the rich innkeeper 's , in the inn at Herning , far towards the west , many miles from here.
And person_1 and person_0 took leave of one another.
People called them `` the betrothed ;"
And thereupon they parted.
person_1 was confirmed.
He did it all alone , for his mother kept no farm-servant , and his father had died long ago.
Only seldom he got news of person_0 from some passing postillion or eel-fisher.
This was certainly good news.
There she stood , in grand array , and person_1 was in his working clothes.
`` Did you know me again directly , person_1 ?"
How often I have thought of you , person_0 , and of the old times !"
And arm in arm they sauntered up the great ridge , and looked across the stream towards the heath , towards the great hills overgrown with bloom.
It was perfectly silent ; but by the time they parted it had grown quite clear to him that person_0 must be his wife.
Her father and person_1 escorted her as far as the village.
His eyes brightened , but still the words came halting over his lips.
`` Yes , let us wait for a time , person_1 ,"
she replied ; and he kissed her lips.
`` I confide in you , person_1 ,"
said person_0 ; `` and I think that I love you -- but I will sleep upon it"
And with that they parted.
A year passed by , in the course of which two letters were exchanged between person_1 and person_0.
The signature was prefaced by the words , `` Faithful till death !"
One day the boatman came into person_1 , and brought him a greeting from person_0.
said the boatman.
At first person_1 said not a word ; but he became as white as the wall , and slightly shook his head.
Then he said slowly : `` person_0 must not refuse this advantageous offer"
`` Then do you write a few words to her ,"
said the boatman.
Do not think of me , or my position , but think of your own welfare.
You are bound to me by no promise , and if in your heart you have given me one , I release you from it.
May all treasures of happiness be poured out upon you , person_0.
Heaven will console me in its own good time.
`` Ever your sincere friend , `` ib"
And the letter was dispatched , and person_0 duly received it.
On the journey , person_0 met her father in a certain village ; and here the two took leave of one another.
Her part had thus come true.
And to him , person_1 , the nut had offered only black earth.
The gipsy-woman had said , this was `` the best of all for him"
Yes , it was right , that also was coming true.
The black earth was the best for him.
Now he understood clearly what had been the woman 's meaning.
In the black earth , in the dark grave , would be the best happiness for him.
And once again years passed by , not very many , but they seemed long years to person_1.
Yes , now person_0 could have the golden carriage , and plenty of fine clothes.
And again the weather bloomed and faded.
The winter had swept for many years across the heath , and over the ridge beneath which person_1 dwelt , sheltered from the rough winds.
.
It was a great golden armlet of ancient workmanship that he had found.
He had disturbed a `` Hun 's Grave ,"
and discovered the costly treasure buried in it.
`` You have found in the earth the best thing you could find ,"
said the judge.
`` The best thing !"
thought person_1.
So person_1 traveled with the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen.
To him , who had but once or twice passed beyond the river that rolled by his home , this seemed like a voyage across the ocean.
And he arrived in Copenhagen.
The value of the gold he had found was paid over to him ; it was a large sum -- six hundred dollars.
And person_1 of the heath wandered about in the great capital.
He had wandered into the suburb of Christianhaven , into a poor little street.
Not a human being was to be seen.
At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched houses.
person_1 inquired of the little one the way to the street which he wanted ; but she looked shyly at him , and began to cry bitterly.
He asked her what ailed her , but could not understand what she said in reply.
The air in this chamber was heavy and almost suffocating : no light was burning ; but there was heavy sighing and moaning in one corner.
person_1 struck a light with the help of a match.
It was the mother of the child who lay sighing on the miserable bed.
`` Can I be of any service to you ?"
asked person_1.
`` This little girl has brought me up here , but I am a stranger in this city.
Are there no neighbors or friends whom I could call to you ?"
And he raised the sick woman 's head , and smoothed her pillow.
The wealth which her husband had inherited from his parents had made him proud and arrogant.
His carriage had bent over more and more , so to speak , until at last it turned over completely.
The icy hand of death was already on person_0.
It was her eldest child , also a little person_0 , that here suffered hunger and poverty with her , and whom person_1 had now brought home.
`` I am unhappy at the thought of dying and leaving the poor child here alone ,"
she said.
`` Ah , what is to become of the poor thing ?"
And not a word more could she utter.
And person_1 brought out another match , and lighted up a piece of candle he found in the room , and the flame illumined the wretched dwelling.
And it was in the forest by the river Gudenau , in the region of the heath.
-LRB- Illustration : LITTLE CHRISTINE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa person_1 had money , and was said to have provided for the future.
He had won gold out of the black earth , and he had a person_0 for his own , after all"
The insignia of the great Japanese Empire is composed of three treasures which have been considered sacred , and guarded with jealous care from time immemorial.
These are the Yatano-no-Kagami or the Mirror of Yata , the Yasakami-no-Magatama or the Jewel of Yasakami , and the Murakumo-no-Tsurugi or the Sword of Murakumo.
This person_2 was the second son of the Emperor Keiko , and he was named person_1.
These rebels seemed to delight in rebelling against the King , in breaking the laws and defying all authority.
At last King Keiko ordered his younger son person_2 to subdue the brigands and , if possible , to rid the land of their evil lives.
Even then there was no man who could rival him for courage and bold deeds , and he received his father 's command with great joy.
She then wished him all success in his undertaking and bade him good speed.
The young person_2 bowed low before his aunt , and received her gracious gift with much pleasure and many respectful bows.
`` I will now set out ,"
said the person_2 , and returning to the Palace he put himself at the head of his troops.
He now met with great difficulties , for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough.
It was all but impossible to go on.
We can not clear the roads and fight as well.
It is wiser for me to resort to stratagem and come upon my enemies unawares.
In that way I may be able to kill them without much exertion"
So he now bade his army halt by the way.
With her help he put on the robe , and let his hair down till it flowed over his shoulders.
When he had finished his unusual toilet , Ototachibana brought him her mirror.
He smiled as he gazed at himself -- the disguise was so perfect.
He hardly knew himself , so changed was he.
All traces of the warrior had disappeared , and in the shining surface only a beautiful lady looked back at him.
Thus completely disguised , he set out for the enemy 's camp alone.
In the folds of his silk gown , next his strong heart , was hidden a sharp dagger.
The two chiefs Kumaso and person_0ru wore sitting in their tent , resting in the cool of the evening , when the person_2 approached.
They had both heard of the young warrior 's renown , and for the first time in their wicked lives they felt afraid.
Like an apparition of loveliness she appeared in the soft twilight.
Little did they dream that it was their enemy whose coming they so dreaded who now stood before them in this disguise.
`` What a beautiful woman ! Where has she come from ?"
said the astonished Kumaso , forgetting war and council and everything as he looked at the gentle intruder.
He beckoned to the disguised person_2 and bade him sit down and serve them with wine.
person_1 felt his heart swell with a fierce glee for he now knew that his plan would succeed.
This was the moment for which the brave person_2 had been waiting.
`` Wait one moment !"
gasped the brigand painfully , and he seized the person_2 's hand.
person_1 relaxed his hold somewhat and said.
`` Why should I pause , thou villain ?"
Alone you have ventured into our stronghold , alone you have attacked and killed us ! Surely you are more than mortal ?"
and he held the dagger dripping red above the rebel 's head.
`` Ah ,"
gasped the dying man with a great effort , `` I have often heard of you.
You are indeed a strong man to have so easily overcome us.
Allow me to give you a new name.
From henceforth you shall be known as person_1.
Our title I bequeath to you as the bravest man in person_1"
And with these noble words , person_0ru fell back and died.
The person_2 having thus successfully put an end to his father 's enemies in the world , was prepared to return to the capital.
On the way back he passed through the province of Idum.
Here he met with another outlaw named Idzumo person_0ru who he knew had done much harm in the land.
He again resorted to stratagem , and feigned friendship with the rebel under an assumed name.
Having done this he made a sword of wood and jammed it tightly in the shaft of his own strong sword.
Unperceived , he managed to change swords , putting his wooden one in place of the keen steel sword of person_0ru.
Knowing nothing of this , the brigand came up to the bank shortly.
He seized quickly what he thought was his sword and stood on guard to defend himself.
Even if his efforts had been successful the sword would have been of no use to him for it was of wood.
But the person_2 was not allowed to live an idle life long.
The King decided that it was necessary to send an army to do battle with them and bring them to reason.
But who was to lead the men ? person_2 person_0 at once offered to go and bring the newly arisen rebels into subjection.
The person_2 respectfully and with great reverence received the King 's spear , and leaving the capital , marched with his army to the East.
These she presented to him as a parting gift.
The sword was the sword of Murakumo , one of the three sacred treasures which comprise the insignia of the Imperial House of Japan.
Here the governor welcomed the person_2 right heartily and entertained him royally with many feasts.
The person_2 was utterly deceived by the cordiality of his host , which was all feigned , and gladly consented to join in the hunt.
The governor then led the person_2 to a wild and extensive plain where the grass grew high and in great abundance.
At the same time the grass on his left and right burst into flames , and these began to spread swiftly towards him on all sides.
He looked round for a chance of escape.
There was none.
He was surrounded by fire.
`` This deer hunt was then only a cunning trick of the enemy !"
said the person_2 , looking round on the flames and the smoke that crackled and rolled in towards him on every side.
`` What a fool I was to be lured into this trap like a wild beast !"
and he ground his teeth with rage as he thought of the governor 's smiling treachery.
Dangerous as was his situation now , the person_2 was not in the least confounded.
He coolly opened the flint-bag that his aunt had given him and set fire to the grass near him.
Then drawing the sword of Murakumo from its sheath he set to work to cut down the grass on either side of him with all speed.
He determined to die , if that were necessary , fighting for his life and not standing still waiting for death to come to him.
Thus did the brave person_2 person_0 escape out of the snare laid for him by his enemy.
He was full of resource and courage , and finally outwitted and subdued all his foes.
Leaving Yaidzu he marched eastward , and came to the shore at Idzu from whence he wished to cross to Kadzusa.
In these dangers and adventures he had been followed by his faithful loving wife the person_2ss Ototachibana.
But the heart of the person_2 was full of war and conquest and he cared little for the faithful Ototachibana.
But in spite of rebuffs and indifference on her husband 's part , Ototachibana could not find it in her heart to leave him.
And the person_2 was ashamed of his sunburnt wife in her travel-stained garments , and bade her remain behind while he went to visit the person_2ss Miyadzu.
When at last they had all embarked and were fairly on their way across the straits , the sky suddenly clouded and a great storm arose.
For Kin Jin.
If so , I , Ototachibana , will appease the wrath of the Sea God who desires nothing less than my husband 's life !"
Then addressing the sea she said : `` I will take the place of His Augustness , person_1.
I will now cast myself into your outraged depths , giving my life for his.
Therefore hear me and bring him safely to the shore of Kadzusa"
With these words she leaped quickly into the boisterous sea , and the waves soon whirled her away and she was lost to sight.
The gods of the sea were now appeased , and the weather cleared and the sun shone as on a summer 's day.
person_1 soon reached the opposite shore and landed safely , even as his wife Ototachibana had prayed.
His prowess in war was marvelous , and he succeeded after some time in conquering the Eastern Barbarians , the Ainu.
His heart was softened at the remembrance of her , and he never allowed her to pass from his thoughts even for a moment.
Too late had he learned to esteem the goodness of her heart and the greatness of her love for him.
When the person_2 reached Omi he found the people in a state of great excitement and fear.
In many houses as he passed along he saw the signs of mourning and heard loud lamentations.
It.
Not long shall it find pleasure in devouring innocent folk.
I will start out and kill it at once"
With these words he set out for the Ibuki Mountain , where the monster was said to live.
`` This must be the monster ,"
said the person_2 ; `` I do not need my sword for a serpent.
I can kill him with my hands"
He thereupon sprang upon the serpent and tried to strangle it to death with his bare arms.
It was not long before his prodigious strength gained the mastery and the serpent lay dead at his feet.
When be got back he began to feel ill and to have burning pains in his feet , so he knew that the serpent had poisoned him.
He now hastened to the temples of Ise , where you will remember that he prayed before undertaking this long expedition.
His aunt , priestess of the shrine , who had blessed him on his setting out , now came to welcome him back.
Here ends the story of person_2 person_0 of Japan"
Long , long ago , there lived an old bamboo wood-cutter.
Every morning he went forth into the woods and hills wherever the bamboo reared its lithe green plumes against the sky.
Suddenly the green grove of bamboos was flooded with a bright soft light , as if the full moon had risen over the spot.
Looking round in astonishment , he saw that the brilliance was streaming from one bamboo.
The old man.
full of wonder.
dropped his ax and went towards the light.
`` You must be sent to be my child , for I find you here among the bamboos where lies my daily work ,"
said the old man , and taking the little creature in his hand he took it home to his wife to bring up.
He built himself a fine house , and was no longer known as the poor bamboo woodcutter , but as a wealthy man.
Her presence seemed to have a benign influence on those there.
For three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music.
They stayed there day and night , sacrificing even their sleep for a chance of seeing her , but all in vain.
All except five person_1s , whose ardor and determination , instead of waning , seemed to wax greater with obstacles.
They stood there in all weathers , in sunshine and in rain.
Sometimes they wrote letters to the person_0 , but no answer was vouchsafed to them.
Still Princes person_2 gave no sign of having received their verses.
In this hopeless state the winter passed.
The snow and frost and the cold winds gradually gave place to the gentle warmth of spring.
Thus several days passed , but even so they could not rest in their homes.
So again they set out for the bamboo-cutter 's house.
Will you refuse to do as I wish ?"
The old man listened with great joy as she spoke these dutiful words.
Then he told her how anxious he was to see her safely and happily married before he died.
`` I am an old man , over seventy years of age , and my end may come any time now.
It is necessary and right that you should see these five suitors and choose one of them"
`` Oh , why ,"
said the person_0 in distress , `` must I do this ? I have no wish to marry now"
`` I found you ,"
answered the old man , `` many years ago , when you were a little creature three inches high , in the midst of a great white light.
The light streamed from the bamboo in which you were hid and led me to you.
So I have always thought that you were more than mortal woman.
`` All you say is very reasonable ,"
They have stood outside this house through the winter and the summer , often denying themselves food and sleep so that they may win you.
What more can you demand ?"
Then person_0 said she must make further trial of their love before she would grant their request to interview her.
The five warriors were to prove their love by each bringing her from distant countries something that she desired to possess.
Then he gave them her message , that she would consent to marry whosoever was successful in bringing her what she wanted.
This was to test them.
The five all accepted the trial , and thought it an excellent plan , for it would prevent jealousy between them.
person_0 then sent word to the First person_1 that she requested him to bring her the stone bowl which had belonged to Buddha in India.
The roots of this tree were of silver , the trunk of gold , and the branches bore as fruit white jewels.
The Third person_1 was told to go to China and search for the fire-rat and to bring her its skin.
The Fourth person_1 was told to search for the dragon that carried on its head the stone radiating five colors and to bring the stone to her.
The Fifth person_1 was to find the swallow which carried a shell in its stomach and to bring the shell to her.
The old man thought these very hard tasks and hesitated to carry the messages , but the person_0 would make no other conditions.
He then wrapped it in a cloth of gold and , waiting quietly for three years , returned and carried it to the old man.
person_0 wondered that the person_1 should have returned so soon.
She returned it at once and refused to see him.
The person_1 threw the bowl away and returned to his home in despair.
He gave up now all hopes of ever winning the person_0.
He only allowed his servants to accompany him half-way , and then sent them back.
Every one whom he had asked declared that Mount Horai belonged to the land of fable and not to fact.
When the branch was finished , he took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if he were wearied and worn out with travel.
He put the jeweled branch into a lacquer box and carried it to the bamboo-cutter , begging him to present it to the person_0.
So he tried to persuade the person_0 to consent to see the man.
But she remained silent and looked very sad.
The old man began to take out the branch and praised it as a wonderful treasure to be found nowhere in the whole land.
person_0 took the branch in her hand and looked at it carefully.
The old man then went out to the expectant person_1 , who had now approached the house , and asked where he had found the branch.
Then the man did not scruple to make up a long story.
`` Two years ago I took a ship and started in search of Mount Horai.
After going before the wind for some time I reached the far Eastern Sea.
Here I found the place inhabited by demons who at one time threatened to kill and eat me.
Our food gave out , and we suffered much from sickness on board.
On nearer approach , this proved to be an island , in the center of which rose a high mountain.
I went up to him and asked him if I had , by good chance , found the island of Mount Horai , and he answered :"
` Yes , this is Mount Horai ! '"
`` With much difficulty I climbed to the summit , here stood the golden tree growing with silver roots in the ground.
The wonders of that strange land are many , and if I began to tell you about them I could never stop.
In spite of my wish to stay there long , on breaking off the branch I hurried back.
I have not even waited to change my raiment , so anxious was I to bring the branch to the person_0 quickly"
She called in the workmen and had them paid liberally , and they went away happy.
But on the way home they were overtaken by the disappointed man.
who beat them till they were nearly dead , for letting out the secret , and they barely escaped with their lives.
Now the Third person_1 had a friend in China , so he wrote to him to get the skin of the fire-rat.
The virtue of any part of this animal was that no fire could harm it.
He promised his friend any amount of money he liked to ask if only he could get him the desired article.
He handed his friend a large sum of money , and received the fire-rat 's skin.
When he reached home he put it carefully in a box and sent it in to the person_0 while he waited outside for her answer.
If it were the real thing it would not burn.
So she took off the crape wrapper and opened the box , and then threw the skin into the fire.
The skin crackled and burnt up at once , and the person_0 knew that this man also had not fulfilled his word.
So the Third person_1 failed also.
Now the Fourth person_1 was no more enterprising than the rest.
His numerous retainers and servants started out in different directions , with no intention , however , of obeying what they considered an impossible order.
They simply took a holiday , went to pleasant country places together , and grumbled at their master 's unreasonableness.
One year passed away in weary waiting , and still his men did not return with the dragon-jewel.
The person_1 became desperate.
They were at last blown on shore , for navigation was primitive in those days.
Worn out with his travels and anxiety , the fourth suitor gave himself up to rest.
He had caught a very heavy cold , and had to go to bed with a swollen face.
The governor of the place , hearing of his plight , sent messengers with a letter inviting him to his house.
Like all the rest , the Fifth person_1 failed in his quest -- he could not find the swallow 's shell.
When the Court lady arrived , in spite of her father 's entreaties , person_0 refused to see her.
The Imperial messenger insisted , saying it was the Emperor 's order.
So he planned to go on a hunting excursion in the neighborhood of the bamboo-cutter 's house , and see the person_0 himself.
He sent word to the old man of his intention , and he received consent to the scheme.
The next day the Emperor set out with his retinue , which he soon managed to outride.
He found the bamboo-cutter 's house and dismounted.
He then entered the house and went straight to where the person_0 was sitting with her attendant maidens.
Her only answer was to hide her face in her sleeves.
But the person_0 stopped him.
Her figure faded from his sight while he looked.
The Emperor then promised to leave her free if only she would resume her former shape , which she did.
So be bade her good-by , and left the house with a sad heart.
These little songs always gave him pleasure.
On the fifteenth day of that very month of August her friends from the moon would come to fetch her , and she would have to return.
Her parents were both there , but having spent a lifetime on the earth she had forgotten them , and also the moon-world to which she belonged.
The old bamboo-cutter went out to meet the Imperial messengers.
The last few days of sorrow had told upon the old man ; he had aged greatly , and looked much more than his seventy years.
The men returned and told His Majesty all that had passed.
On the fifteenth day of that month the Emperor sent a guard of two thousand warriors to watch the house.
One thousand stationed themselves on the roof , another thousand kept watch round all the entrances of the house.
All were well trained archers , with bows and arrows.
The bamboo-cutter and his wife hid person_0 in an inner room.
Even the Emperors men would be powerless.
The night wore on ! The yellow harvest moon rose high in the heavens , flooding the world asleep with her golden light.
Silence reigned over the pine and the bamboo forests , and on the roof where the thousand men-at-arms waited.
Then suddenly the watchers saw a cloud form round the moon -- and while they looked this cloud began to roll earthwards.
Nearer and nearer it came , and every one saw with dismay that its course lay towards the house.
In a short time the sky was entirely obscured , till at last the cloud lay over the dwelling only ten feet off the ground.
In the midst of the cloud there stood a flying chariot , and in the chariot a band of luminous beings.
`` The time has come ,"
he said , `` for person_0 to return to the moon from whence she came.
She committed a grave fault , and as a punishment was sent to live down here for a time.
We know what good care you have taken of the person_0 , and we have rewarded you for this and have sent you wealth and prosperity.
We put the gold in the bamboos for you to find"
said the old man.
`` I pray you to look elsewhere"
Then the messenger called aloud , saying : `` person_0 , come out from this lowly dwelling.
Rest not here another moment ,"
The messenger led her forth and placed her in the chariot.
She looked back , and saw with pity the deep sorrow of the old man.
The bamboo-cutter implored to be allowed to accompany her , but this was not allowed.
The person_0 took off her embroidered outer garment and gave it to him as a keepsake.
She swallowed a little and was about to give the rest to the old man , but she was prevented from doing so.
The robe of wings was about to be put upon her shoulders , but she said : `` Wait a little.
I must not forget my good friend the Emperor.
I must write him once more to say good-by while still in this human form"
In spite of the impatience of the messengers and charioteers she kept them waiting while she wrote.
person_0 's letter was carried to the Palace.
Mount Fuji , and there the Royal emissaries burnt it on the summit at sunrise.
So to this day people say there is smoke to be seen rising from the top of Mount Fuji to the clouds"
Long , long ago Japan was governed by Hohodemi , the fourth Mikoto -LRB- or Augustness -RRB- in descent from the illustrious Amaterasu , the Sun Goddess.
Because of his matchless skill as a hunter , he was called `` Yama-sachi-hiko"
or `` The person_0 of the Mountains"
His elder brother was a very skillful fisher , and as he far surpassed all rivals in fishing , he was named `` Unii-sachi-hiko"
or the `` Skillful Fisher of the person_3"
Would it not be wise for us to make a change ? Will you try hunting in the mountains and I will go and fish in the sea ?"
Give me your bow and arrow and I will set out at once for the mountains and hunt for game"
The person_0 took his brother 's much-prized fishing hook and rod and went down to the seashore and sat down on the rocks.
He baited his hook and then threw it into the sea clumsily.
He sat and gazed at the little float bobbing up and down in the water , and longed for a good fish to come and be caught.
The whole day passed in this way , while he sat on the rocks holding the fishing rod and waiting in vain for his luck to turn.
At last the day began to darken , and the evening came ; still he had caught not a single fish.
He had failed to find any game while hunting that day , and was not only in a bad temper , but looked fearfully cross.
The person_0 went forward timidly , for he feared his brother 's anger , and said : `` Oh , my brother , I have indeed done badly"
`` What is the matter ? -- what have you done ?"
asked the elder brother impatiently.
`` I have lost your precious fishing hook --"
While he was still speaking his brother stopped him , and cried out fiercely : `` Lost my hook ! It is just what I expected.
The mistake of our trying unfamiliar tasks is soon seen ! And you have done badly.
I will not return you your bow and arrow till you have found my hook.
Look to it that you find it and return it to me quickly"
The person_0 felt that he was to blame for all that had come to pass , and bore his brother 's scornful scolding with humility and patience.
He hunted everywhere for the hook most diligently , but it was nowhere to be found.
He was at last obliged to give up all hope of finding it.
He then went home , and in desperation broke his beloved sword into pieces and made five hundred hooks out of it.
It was useless ; his brother would not listen to him , much less grant his request.
The person_0 then made another five hundred hooks , and again took them to his brother , beseeching him to pardon him.
`` Though you make a million hooks ,"
said the Skillful Fisher , shaking his head , `` they are of no use to me.
I can not forgive you unless you bring me back my own hook"
He was much cast down , for he had lost all hope of ever finding his brother 's hook now.
`` You are Hohodemi , the Augustness , sometimes called the person_0 , are you not ?"
asked the old man.
`` What are you doing alone in such a place ?"
`` Yes , I am he ,"
answered the unhappy young man.
`` Unfortunately , while fishing I lost my brother 's precious fishing hook.
But who are you ?"
`` My name is Shiwozuchino Okina , and I live near by on this shore.
I am sorry to hear what misfortune has befallen you.
You must indeed be anxious.
`` Then what can I do ?"
asked the distressed man.
I think that would be the best way"
`` Your idea is a splendid one ,"
`` Oh , there will be no difficulty about your getting there ,"
said the old man ; `` I can soon make something for you to ride on through the sea"
`` Thank you ,"
said the person_0 , `` I shall be very grateful to you if you will be so kind"
The old man at once set to work , and soon made a basket and offered it to the person_0.
He received it with joy , and taking it to the water , mounted it , and prepared to start.
The person_0 made all the haste he could , riding on the basket which had been given him by his friend.
The pillars of the gate were made of beautiful red coral , and the gate itself was adorned with glittering gems of all kinds.
Large katsura trees overshadowed it.
In the shade of the trees before the gate he noticed a well full of fresh spring water.
Surely some one would come out to draw water from the well some time , he thought.
Then he climbed into the tree overhanging the well , and seated himself to rest on one of the branches , and waited for what might happen.
Ere long he saw the huge gate swing open , and two beautiful women came out.
He said not a word , however , but silently gazed at them through the foliage of the trees , waiting to see what they would do.
He saw that in their hands they carried golden buckets.
Never before had they seen the face of mortal man ; they were frightened , and drew back quickly with their golden buckets in their hands.
They gazed at him face to face , but their tongues were still with wonder and could not find a word to say to him.
So I climbed into the tree , much vexed , and waited for some one to come.
Just at that moment , while I was thirstily and impatiently waiting , you noble ladies appeared , as if in answer to my great need.
Therefore I pray you of your mercy give me some water to drink , for I am a thirsty traveler in a strange land"
He placed the jewel in the cup and returned it to them , and said , bowing deeply : `` This is a token of my thanks !"
`` No ordinary mortal would give away a jewel so freely.
Will you not honor us by telling us who you are ?"
said the elder damsel.
`` Certainly ,"
said the person_0 , `` I am Hohodemi , the fourth Mikoto , also called in Japan , the person_0"
`` Are you indeed Hohodemi , the grandson of Amaterasu , the Sun Goddess ?"
asked the damsel who had spoken first.
`` I am the eldest daughter of Ryn Jin , the person_2 of the person_3 , and my name is Princess Tayotama"
`` And ,"
said the younger maiden , who at last found her tongue , `` I am her sister , the Princess Tamayori"
`` Are you indeed the daughters of Ryn Jin , the person_2 of the person_3 ? I can not tell you how glad I am to meet you ,"
said the person_0.
As my brother prizes his fishing hook above all his other possessions , this is the greatest calamity that could have befallen me.
Unless I find it again I can never hope to win my brother 's forgiveness , for he is very angry at what I have done.
I have searched for it many , many times , but I can not find it , therefore I am much troubled.
This kind old man also showed me how to come.
Now you know how it is I am here and why.
I want to ask Ryn Jin , if he knows where the lost hook is.
Will you be so kind as to take me to your father ? And do you think he will see me ?"
asked the person_0 anxiously.
I am sure he will say that good fortune has befallen him , that so great and noble a man as you , the grandson of Amaterasu.
should come down to the bottom of the sea"
And then turning to her younger sister , she said : `` Do you not think so , Tamayori ?"
`` Yes , indeed ,"
answered the Princess Tamayori , in her sweet voice.
`` As you say , we can know no greater honor than to welcome the Mikoto to our home"
`` Then I ask you to be so kind as to lead the way ,"
said the person_0.
`` Condescend to enter , Mikoto -LRB- Augustness -RRB- ,"
said both the sisters , and bowing low , they led him through the gate.
He then ordered them all to the entrance of the Palace to welcome the person_0.
Ryn Jin then dressed himself in his robes of ceremony , and went out to welcome him.
Condescend to remember us forever !"
`` Are you indeed Ryn Jin , the person_2 of the person_3 , of whom I have so often heard ?"
answered the person_0 , saluting his host most ceremoniously.
`` I must apologize for all the trouble I am giving you by my unexpected visit"
And he bowed again , and thanked the person_3.
`` You need not thank me ,"
said Ryn Jin.
`` It is I who must thank you for coming.
Although the person_3 Palace is a poor place , as you see , I shall be highly honored if you will make us a long visit"
There was much gladness between the person_3 and the person_0 , and they sat and talked for a long time.
A great feast was now spread before the person_2 and his Royal guest.
All in the Palace tried to do their best to please him and to show him that he was a much honored guest.
May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea ?"
`` Certainly ,"
said the obliging person_3 , `` I will immediately summon them all here and ask them"
Then the person_3 said solemnly : `` Our visitor who is sitting before you all is the August grandson of Amaterasu.
His name is Hohodemi , the fourth Augustness , and he is also called the person_0 of the Mountains.
While he was fishing the other day upon the shore of Japan , some one robbed him of his brother 's fishing hook.
All the fishes were taken by surprise when they heard these words , and could say nothing for some time.
They sat looking at each other and at the Dragon person_2.
At last the cuttlefish came forward and said : `` I think the TAI -LRB- the red bream -RRB- must be the thief who has stolen the hook !"
`` Where is your proof ?"
asked the person_2.
You had better send for him at once !"
All the fish agreed to this , and said : `` It is certainly strange that the TAI is the only fish who has not obeyed your summons.
Will you send for him and inquire into the matter.
Then our innocence will be proved"
`` Yes ,"
said the person_3 , `` it is strange that the TAI has not come , for he ought to be the first to be here.
Send for him at once !"
Without waiting for the person_2 's order the cuttlefish had already started for the TAI 'S dwelling , and he now returned , bringing the TAI with him.
He led him before the person_2.
The TAI sat there looking frightened and ill.
.
He certainly was in pain , for his usually red face was pale , and his eyes were nearly closed and looked but half their usual size.
`` Answer , O TAI !"
cried the person_3 , `` why did you not come in answer to my summons today ?"
`` I have been ill since yesterday ,"
answered the TAI ; `` that is why I could not come"
`` Do n't say another word !"
cried out Ryn Jin angrily.
`` Your illness is the punishment of the gods for stealing the Mikoto 's hook"
`` It is only too true !"
said the TAI ; `` the hook is still in my throat , and all my efforts to get it out have been useless.
I had no intention of stealing the Mikoto 's hook.
I heedlessly snapped at the bait which I saw in the water , and the hook came off and stuck in my throat.
So I hope you will pardon me"
The cuttlefish now came forward , and said to the person_2 : `` What I said was right.
You see the hook still sticks in the TAI 'S throat.
I hope to be able to pull it out in the presence of the Mikoto , and then we can return it to him safely !"
`` O please make haste and pull it out !"
`` All right , TAI SAN ,"
He then washed it and brought it to the person_2.
It was indeed the TAI who had taken the hook , but he had already suffered enough for his fault , if fault it could be called.
What had been done was done in heedlessness and not by intention.
So he begged the person_3 to forgive his subject.
Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge ? Ryn Jin forgave his subject at once at the request of his August guest.
and was obliged to stay on for some time.
The years pass swiftly when any one is truly happy.
I must also return the fishing hook to my brother and ask his forgiveness for having deprived him of it for so long.
I am indeed very sorry to part from you , but this time it can not be helped.
With your gracious permission , I will take my leave to-day.
I hope to make you another visit some day.
Please give up the idea of my staying longer now"
You have been a noble and honored guest and we have heartily made you welcome.
I hope you will not forget us.
When the person_3 had finished speaking he turned to his two daughters and bade them bring him the two Tide-Jewels of the person_3.
The two Princesses bowed low , rose and glided out of the hall.
In a few minutes they returned , each one carrying in her hands a flashing gem which filled the room with light.
As the person_0 looked at them he wondered what they could be.
We now give them to you as a parting gift in token of our great affection for you.
These two gems are called the nanjiu and the kanjiu"
The person_0 bowed low to the ground and said : `` I can never thank you enough for all your kindness to me.
And now will you add one more favor to the rest and tell me what these jewels are and what I am to do with them ?"
`` The nanjiu ,"
Then Ryn Jin showed his friend how to use the talismans one by one and handed them to him.
After thanking his kind host again and again , he prepared to depart.
The person_3 and the two Princesses , Tayotama and Tamayori , and all the inmates of the Palace , came out to say `` Good-by ,"
Here he found , instead of the queer basket on which he had come to the Realm of Ryn Gu , a large crocodile waiting for him.
Never had he seen such a huge creature.
It measured eight fathoms in length from the tip of its tail to the end of its long mouth.
The person_3 had ordered the monster to carry the person_0 back to Japan.
As soon as the crocodile landed him , the person_0 hastened to tell the Skillful Fisher of his safe return.
Now the Skillful Fisher had used the lost hook as an excuse for driving his brother out of the country.
One day when the person_0 was walking in the rice fields his brother followed him with a dagger.
So he took out the Jewel of the Flood Tide from the bosom of his dress and raised it to his forehead.
Instantly over the fields and over the farms the sea came rolling in wave upon wave till it reached the spot where his brother was standing.
The Skillful Fisher stood amazed and terrified to see what was happening.
In another minute he was struggling in the water and calling on his brother to save him from drowning.
The person_0 had a kind heart and could not bear the sight of his brother 's distress.
He at once put back the Jewel of the Flood Tide and took out the Jewel of the Ebb Tide.
So he humbled himself before the person_0 and asked him to forgive him all the wrong he had done him.
Then the person_0 said that he would forgive his brother if he would throw into the receding tide all his evil ways.
The Skillful Fisher promised and there was peace between the two brothers.
From this time he kept his word and became a good man and a kind brother.
The person_0 now ruled his person_2dom without being disturbed by family strife , and there was peace in Japan for a long , long time.
This is the congratulatory ending of the person_0 and the Skillful Fisher"
There is a street in Copenhagen that has this strange name -- `` Hysken Straede"
and not `` Hysken"
-- in fact , it is several centuries ago.
The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck carried on trade with Copenhagen.
Yes , pepper was the chief article here , and so it happened that the German clerks got the nickname `` pepper gentry ;"
From them all unmarried men , who have attained a certain age , are called in Denmark `` pepper gentry ;"
and this must be understood by all who wish to comprehend this history.
The `` pepper gentleman"
The boys sing , `` Cut , cut wood ! Poor bachelor so good.
Go , take your nightcap , go to rest , For ` tis the nightcap suits you best !"
Yes , that 's what they sing about the `` pepperer"
-- thus they make game of the poor bachelor and his nightcap , and turn it into ridicule , just because they know very little about either.
Ah , that kind of nightcap no one should wish to earn ! And why not ? -- We shall hear.
-LRB- Illustration : THE PEPPERER 'S BOOTH.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa In the old times the `` Housekin Street"
was not paved , and the people stumbled out of one hole into another , as in a neglected bye-way ; and it was narrow too.
Behind the counters young men were seldom seen.
No , grandfather 's great-grandfather may look like that , and has been thus portrayed , but the `` pepper gentry"
His hat was high-crowned and broad-brimmed , and sometimes one of the youngest clerks would mount a feather.
The old fellow was a subject for a painter.
People knew that he came from Bremen ; but that was not his native place , though his master lived there.
His own native place was in Thuringia , the town of person_0 , close by the Wartburg.
Old person_2 did not speak much of this , but he thought of it all the more.
The old clerks of the Haeuschen Street did not often come together.
It was certainly not an amusing life.
To be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot : nobody cares for you , unless you happen to get in anybody 's way.
Often when it was dark night outside , with snow and rain , the place looked very gloomy and lonely.
No lamps were to be seen , with the exception of one solitary light hanging before the picture of the Virgin that was fastened against the wall.
The plash of the water against the neighbouring rampart at the castle wharf could be plainly heard.
Such evenings are long and dreary , unless people devise some employment for themselves.
And that is just what old person_2 did ; for he used to mend his clothes and put pieces on his boots.
When he at last sought his couch , he used from habit to keep his nightcap on.
He drew it down a little closer ; but soon he would push it up again , to see if the light had been properly extinguished.
And therefore he rose from his bed , and crept down the ladder , for it could scarcely be called a stair.
And when he came to the fire-pan not a spark was to be discovered , and he might just go back again.
Sometimes again they seemed to rise up in flame , illuminating a picture of life that never faded out of his heart.
The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged to be fine , but the woods of Thuringia arose far more beautiful in the eyes of person_2.
This he remembered very vividly.
A glittering tear rolled down over his cheek ; and in this tear he could plainly see two children playing -- a boy and a girl.
The boy had red cheeks , and yellow curling hair , and honest blue eyes.
He was the son of the merchant person_2 -- it was himself.
The little girl had brown eyes and black hair , and had a bright clever look.
She was the burgomaster 's daughter person_1.
The two were playing with an apple.
They shook the apple , and heard the pips rattling in it.
`` Then you shall see ,"
she said , `` what will come out.
It will be something you do n't at all expect.
A whole apple tree will come out , but not directly"
And she put the pip in a flower-pot , and both were very busy and eager about it.
`` Now , you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has struck root ,"
said person_1.
`` That wo n't do at all.
I did it with my flowers ; but only twice.
I wanted to see if they were growing -- and I did n't know any better then -- and the plants withered"
At length , however , the spring came , and the sun shone warm again ; and two little green leaves came up out of the pot.
`` Those are for me and person_1 ,"
said the boy.
`` That 's beautiful -- that 's marvellously beautiful !"
Soon a third leaf made its appearance.
Whom did that represent ? Yes , and there came another , and yet another.
Day by day and week by week they grew larger , and the plant began to take the form of a real tree.
In the neighborhood of person_0 a row of stony mountains rises up.
One of these mountains is round in outline , and lifts itself above the rest , naked and without tree , bush , or grass.
It is called the Venus Mount.
In this mountain dwells Lady Venus , one of the deities of the heathen times.
She is also called Lady Holle ; and every child in and around person_0 has heard about her.
She it was who lured Tannhauser , the noble knight and minstrel , from the circle of the singers of the Wartburg into her mountain.
-LRB- Illustration : IMPERTINENT MOLLY.
But person_2 did not dare.
person_1 , however , did it , though she only said the words `` Lady Holle , Lady Holle !"
_ I _ may kiss him !"
she would say proudly.
That was her vanity ; and person_2 submitted , and thought no more about it.
In the chapel her picture was hanging , surrounded by silver lamps ; but it was not in the least like person_1.
And the tree developed itself strongly , so that it could resist the winter.
And it seemed as if , after the rigor of the cold season was past , it put forth blossoms in spring for very joy.
In the autumn it brought two apples -- one for person_1 and one for person_2.
It could not well have produced less.
The tree had grown apace , and person_1 grew like the tree.
She was as fresh as an apple-blossom ; but person_2 was not long to behold this flower.
All things change ! person_1 's father left his old home , and person_1 went with him , far away.
And person_1 wept , and person_2 wept ; but all their tears melted into one , and this tear had the rosy , charming hue of joy.
For person_1 told him she loved him -- loved him more than all the splendors of Weimar.
One , two , three years went by , and during this period two letters were received.
One came by a carrier , and a traveller brought the other.
The way was long and difficult , and passed through many windings by towns and villages.
and that did not apply to person_2 , nor would he ever be able to think , like Tristram , `` She has forgotten me"
And especially that passage appeared charming to him : `` From the forest , down in the vale , Sang her sweet song the nightingale"
He wished to come unexpectedly , and he came unexpectedly.
He could not understand himself -- he could not understand the others : but _ we _ can understand it.
One may be admitted into a house and associate with a family without becoming one of them.
Yes , this was the kind of thing person_2 felt.
`` I am an honest girl ,"
said person_1 ; `` and I myself will tell you what it is.
Much has changed since we were children together -- changed inwardly and outwardly.
Habit and will have no power over our hearts.
person_2 , I should not like to have an enemy in you , now that I shall soon be far away from here.
You must reconcile yourself to this.
Farewell , person_2 !"
And person_2 bade her farewell.
No tear came into his eye , but he felt that he was no longer person_1 's friend.
Within twenty-four hours person_2 was back in person_0 , though certainly the horse on which he rode was ruined.
`` What matter !"
But the apple tree was not broken down , though he himself was broken down , and bound on a couch by fever.
person_2 's father ceased to be the richest of merchants.
Heavy days -- days of trial -- were at the door ; misfortune came rolling into the house like great waves of the sea.
The father became a poor man.
Sorrow and suffering took away his strength.
Then person_2 had to think of something else besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against person_1.
person_2 went to Bremen.
There he learned what poverty and hard living meant ; and these sometimes make the heart hard , and sometimes soften it , even too much.
`` God 's will is best !"
he would say then.
`` It was well that I was not permitted to keep person_1 's heart -- that she did not remain true to me.
That was a mercy of Providence towards me.
Everything has happened for the best.
It was not her fault -- and I have been so bitter , and have shown so much rancor towards her !"
And years went by.
person_2 's father was dead , and strangers lived in the old house.
But person_2 was destined to see it again.
His rich employer sent him on commercial journeys , and his duty led him into his native town of person_0.
The old Wartburg stood unchanged on the mountain , with `` the monk and the nun"
hewn out in stone.
The great oaks gave to the scene the outlines it had possessed in his childish days.
The Venus Mount glimmered gray and naked over the valley.
That was a sinful thought , and he blessed himself to drive it away.
And here in the town of his childhood , which he thus saw again through tears , much came back into his remembrance.
`` That flourishes !"
he said.
`` The tree can grow !"
Nevertheless , one of the branches of the tree was broken.
Mischievous hands had torn it down towards the ground ; for now the tree stood by the public way.
`` They break its blossoms off without a feeling of thankfulness -- they steal its fruit and break the branches.
One might say of the tree as has been said of some men -- ` It was not sung at his cradle that it should come thus.
`` Marry ! Ha , ha !"
he laughed bitterly to himself.
Winter had set in early ; it was freezing hard.
Forsaken by all , lay the old bachelor , unable to help himself.
He could scarcely reach the water-jug that he had placed by his bedside , and the last drop it contained had been consumed.
It was not fever , nor sickness , but old age that had struck him down.
Up yonder , where his couch was placed , he was overshadowed as it were by continual night.
The time was very slow , and long , and dreary.
Tears he had none to shed , nor did he feel pain.
The thought of person_1 never came into his mind.
For a moment he felt a sensation of hunger -- of thirst.
Yes , he felt them both.
But nobody came to tend him -- nobody.
Her pious deeds shone bright upon his soul.
He uncovered his head , and looked into her gentle eyes , and everything around him was beautiful and roseate.
Yes , the roses seemed to unfold themselves in fragrance.
And the tree strewed down its fragrant leaves upon him , cooling his burning brow.
`` Now I shall sleep ,"
he whispered to himself.
`` Sleep is refreshing.

aaaaa -RRB- aaa And he slept.
Do n't wish for such a cap for yourself.
It would make your forehead very hot , would make your pulse beat feverishly , and conjure up dreams which appear like reality.
He was immediately seized with dreams of unfortunate love , of bankruptcy , and of heavy times.
`` Hallo ! how the nightcap burns !"
he cried out , and tore it from his head.
And a pearl rolled out , and another , and another , and they sounded and glittered.
`` This must be gout ,"
said the burgomaster.
`` Something dazzles my eyes !"
They were tears , shed half a century before by old person_2 from person_0.
Every one who afterwards put that nightcap upon his head had visions and dreams which excited him not a little.
His own history was changed into that of person_2 , and became a story ; in fact , many stories.
But some one else may tell _ them _.
We have told the first.
And our last word is -- do n't wish for `` The Old Bachelor 's Nightcap"
His only occasion for regret was that he had no heir to succeed him in the kingdom after his death.
This was done.
The slave hearing somebody walk in the room , immediately turned her head to see who it was.
The person_0 of person_1 was extremely surprised to see a slave of so beauteous a form so very ignorant of the world.
He attributed this to the narrowness of her education , and the little care that had been taken to instruct her in the first rules of civility.
We can not tell whether her silence proceeds from pride , sorrow , stupidity , or dumbness ; and this is all we can inform your majesty.
For a whole year she never afforded him the pleasure of a single word.
Once more the king endeavored to get a word from his wife.
' The person_0 of person_1 , ravished to hear the fair slave speak , embraced her tenderly.
' The person_0 of person_1 , in the transport of his joy , said no more to the fair slave.
After the person_0 of person_1 had given this order , he returned to the fair slave again.
` In this retreat my brother contrived all manner of ways to drive the unjust invader from our dominions.
One day `` Sister ,"
` At this discourse of my brother 's , I fell into a violent passion.
`` Brother ,"
This put me into a more violent passion , which occasioned him to say several bitter words that stung me to the quick.
` Notwithstanding the violent displeasure that made me cast myself upon that island , I lived content in retirement.
So at last he resolved to sell me ; which he did to that very merchant who brought me hither and sold me to your majesty.
' After this manner person_2 Gulnare discovered herself to the person_0 of person_1 , and finished her story.
I beseech you to tell me more about the kingdom and people of the sea , who are altogether unknown to me.
' ` Sire , ' replied person_2 Gulnare , ` I shall with pleasure satisfy the person_0 of person_1.
Our common language is the same as that of the writing engraved upon the seal of the great prophet Solomon , the son of David.
They are divided into provinces ; and in each province there are several great cities , well peopled.
In short , there are an infinite number of nations , differing in manners and customs , just as upon the earth.
` The palaces of the kings and princes are very sumptuous and magnificent.
These chariots are open ; and in the middle there is a throne upon which the king sits , and shows himself to his subjects.
The horses are trained up to draw by themselves ; so that there is no occasion for a charioteer to guide them.
' person_2 Gulnare then ordered one of her women to bring her a brazier with a little fire.
After that she bade her retire , and shut the door.
When she was alone , she took a piece of aloes out of a box , and put it into the brazier.
She had no sooner ended , than the sea began to be disturbed.
The company came forward , borne , as it were , upon the surface of the waves.
' She then related the whole of what had befallen her since she quitted the sea.
Rise , and return with us into my kingdom , that I have reconquered from the proud usurper who had made himself master of it.
' The person_0 of person_1 , who heard these words from the recess where he was concealed , was in the utmost alarm.
' But person_2 Gulnare soon put him out of his fears.
He is a religious , wise , and temperate king.
I am his wife , and he has declared me person_2 of person_1 , to share with him in his councils.
Besides , I have a child , the little Prince Beder.
This reflection raised a blush in their faces ; in their emotion their eyes glowed like fire , and they breathed flames at their mouths and nostrils.
This unexpected sight put the person_0 of person_1 , who was totally ignorant of the cause of it , into a dreadful consternation.
She went directly to the recess , and recovered the person_0 of person_1 from his surprise.
' The person_0 of person_1 , encouraged by these words , rose up , and came out into the room with his person_2 Gulnare.
The person_0 of person_1 ran to them , and lifting them up , embraced them one after another.
' So saying , he invited them to take part of the luncheon , and he and his queen sat down at the table with them.
You see I am not alarmed ; neither in truth ought I to be so.
He runs no risk , and you will soon see the king his uncle appear with him again , and bring him back safe and sound.
For he will have the same advantage his uncle and I have , of living equally in the sea and upon the land.
I thought him lost from that very moment , and you now restore life to me by bringing him again.
This made us come empty handed.
' It is impossible to express how greatly the person_0 of person_1 was surprised at the sight of so much riches , enclosed in so little compass.
' ` Sir , ' replied person_0 Saleh , ` I am not at all surprised that your majesty thinks this present so extraordinary.
' This obliged the person_0 of person_1 to accept the present , for which he returned many thanks both to person_0 Saleh and the queen his mother.
' Many tears were shed on both sides upon their separation.
'"
There was once a sultan of India who had three sons.
These , with the princess his niece , were the ornaments of his court.
The eldest of the princes was called Houssain , the second Ali , the youngest person_0 , and the princess his niece , Nouronnihar.
The person_1ss Nouronnihar was the daughter of the younger brother of the sultan , to whom the sultan in his lifetime allowed a considerable revenue.
But that prince had not been married long before he died , and left the princess very young.
He was very much concerned , owing to the difficulty he foresaw whether the two younger would consent to yield to their elder brother.
They went the first day 's journey together ; and slept at the first inn , where the road divided into three different tracks.
person_1 Houssain could not see this quarter without admiration.
It was large , and divided into several streets , all vaulted and shaded from the sun , and yet very light.
' ` Certainly , ' answered person_1 Houssain , ` it must have something very extraordinary about it , which I know nothing of.
In short he looked upon it as an impossible thing for the princes , his younger brothers , to meet with anything to compare with it.
A temple was erected in the middle of this terrace , with a dome about fifty cubits high , which might be seen for several leagues round.
It was thirty cubits long , and twenty broad , built of red marble , highly polished.
Every night and morning there were ceremonies performed in this temple , which were always succeeded by sports , concerts , dancing , singing , and feasts.
This assembly , composed of innumerable multitudes of Indians , met in a plain of vast extent , as far as the eye could reach.
Other scaffolds of at least four or five stories , and painted almost all alike , formed the other three sides.
The trunks , ears , and bodies of these elephants were painted with cinnabar and other colors , representing grotesque figures.
It was a spacious and well-built place , arched over , and supported by large pillars ; along the walls , within and without , were shops.
He will come by presently , and we will call him ; in the meantime sit down on my sofa and rest yourself.
' person_1 Ali accepted the merchant 's obliging offer , and presently the crier passed by.
' The crier showed him , and he looked through , wishing at the same time to see the sultan , his father.
He immediately beheld him in perfect health , sitting on his throne , in the midst of his council.
Come with me , and I will pay you the money.
The prince believed him , took him to the khan where he lodged , counted out the money , and received the tube.
person_1 took the road to Samarcand ; and the day after his arrival there went , as his brothers had done , into the bezestein.
He had not walked long before he heard a crier , who had an artificial apple in his hand , cry it at five-and-thirty purses.
He who possesses it is master of a great treasure.
Upon which person_1 told the crier he would give him forty purses if he cured the sick person by letting him smell at it.
' ` But then , ' replied person_1 Ali , ` you made a short stay there.
I know not what you have got , but believe it to be some trifle , because I do not see that your baggage is increased.
But we ought to wait till our brother person_0 arrives , that we may all communicate our good fortune to each other.
When person_1 came , they embraced and complimented each other on the happiness of meeting together at the place they set out from.
I will show you both the experiment whenever you please.
I expect you to tell me whether what you have brought is to be compared to this carpet.
Take it , ' added person_1 Ali , presenting the tube to him , ` make trial of it yourself.
I saw her in her bed , surrounded by her women and attendants , who were all in tears.
Take the tube , behold for yourselves the miserable state she is in.
' person_1 Ali took the tube out of person_1 Houssain 's hand and after he had looked , presented it to person_1.
The opportunity now presents itself to show you its wonderful virtue.
I have made the experiment , and can show you its wonderful effect on the person_1ss Nouronnihar , if we make all haste to assist her.
She immediately expressed her joy to see them , and thanked them all together , and afterwards person_1 in particular , and they then retired.
While the princess was dressing , the princes went to throw themselves at the sultan their father 's feet , and pay their respects to him.
You must also grant that that knowledge would have been of no service without the artificial apple and the carpet.
Go , and get each of you a bow and arrow , and repair to the great plain outside the city , where the horses are exercised.
I will soon come to you , and I declare I will give the person_1ss Nouronnihar to him that shoots the farthest.
` I do not , however , forget to thank you all in general , and each in particular , for the presents you brought me.
' The three princes had nothing to say against the decision of the sultan.
There were once upon a time two brothers , one rich and the other poor.
The rich one was a goldsmith and evil-hearted.
The poor one supported himself by making brooms , and was good and honorable.
The poor one had two children , who were twin brothers and as like each other as two drops of water.
The two boys went backwards and forwards to the rich house , and often got some of the scraps to eat.
The man took the feather and carried it to his brother , who looked at it and said , `` It is pure gold !"
and gave him a great deal of money for it.
He took the egg home with him , and carried it to his brother , who again said , `` It is pure gold ,"
and gave him what it was worth.
At last the goldsmith said , `` I should indeed like to have the bird itself"
`` Now I can get on ,"
thought he , and went contentedly home.
The goldsmith was crafty and cunning , and knew very well what kind of a bird it was.
He called his wife and said , `` Roast me the gold bird , and take care that none of it is lost.
I have a fancy to eat it all myself"
The woman made the bird ready , put it on the spit , and let it roast.
`` Two little morsels which fell out of the bird ,"
answered they.
`` That must have been the heart and the liver ,"
When it was ready , she carried it to the goldsmith , who consumed it all alone , and left none of it.
The two children did not know what a piece of good-fortune had fallen to their lot.
When next morning they again found two , and so on daily , he went to his brother and told him the strange story.
At length they met with a huntsman , who asked , `` To whom do you children belong ?"
`` We are the poor broom-maker 's boys ,"
`` Come ,"
said the huntsman , `` that is nothing so very bad , if at the same time you keep honest , and are not idle"
They went with him to lie in wait and stayed there a long time , but no game appeared.
He did it , and thus accomplished his trial shot.
`` Now ,"
said the foster-father , `` I pronounce you out of your apprenticeship ; you are skilled huntsmen"
Thereupon the two brothers went forth together into the forest , and took counsel with each other and planned something.
Said he , `` What , then , is your request ?"
They replied , `` We have now finished learning , and we must prove ourselves in the world , so allow us to go away and travel"
Thereupon they ate and drank joyously together.
As they had nothing to eat , one of them said , `` We must shoot something for ourselves or we shall suffer from hunger ,"
and loaded his gun , and looked about him.
and sprang instantly into the thicket , and brought two young ones.
But the little creatures played so merrily , and were so pretty , that the huntsmen could not find it in their hearts to kill them.
They therefore kept them with them , and the little hares followed on foot.
The huntsmen put the two wolves beside the other animals , and they followed behind them.
The two young bears were added to the others , and there were already eight of them.
At length who came ? A lion came , and tossed his mane.
You are crafty and deep"
They replied , `` Not far from here lies a village , from which we have already brought many a fowl ; we will show you the way there"
So they went into the village , bought themselves something to eat , had some food given to their beasts , and then traveled onwards.
The foxes , however , knew their way very well about the district and where the poultry-yards were , and were able to guide the huntsmen.
The younger , however , arrived with his beasts in a town which was all hung with black crape.
He went into an inn , and asked the host if he could accommodate his animals.
The huntsman inquired if she was `` sick unto death ?"
`` No ,"
answered the host , `` she is vigorous and healthy , nevertheless she must die !"
`` How is that ?"
asked the huntsman.
Said the huntsman , `` Why is the dragon not killed ?"
`` Ah ,"
replied the host , `` so many knights have tried it , but it has cost all of them their lives.
The person_0 has promised that he who conquers the dragon shall have his daughter to wife , and shall likewise govern the kingdom after his own death"
The huntsman said nothing more to this , but next morning took his animals , and with them ascended the dragon 's hill.
The huntsman did not drink , but went out and sought for the sword in the ground , but was unable to move it from its place.
When the hour came when the maiden was to be delivered over to the dragon , the person_0 , the marshal , and courtiers accompanied her.
It was not long before the seven-headed dragon came thither with loud roaring.
When he perceived the huntsman , he was astonished and said , `` What business hast thou here on the hill ?"
The huntsman answered , `` I want to fight with thee"
Said the dragon , `` Many knights have left their lives here , I shall soon have made an end of thee too ,"
and he breathed fire out of seven jaws.
Then the dragon rushed upon the huntsman , but he swung his sword until it sang through the air , and struck off three of his heads.
She rejoiced and said , `` Now thou wilt be my dearest husband , for my father has promised me to him who kills the dragon"
Thereupon she took off her necklace of coral , and divided it amongst the animals in order to reward them , and the lion received the golden clasp.
Then she said , `` yes ,"
and both fell asleep.
`` I can not do that ,"
she replied , `` for it was a huntsman with his animals who did it"
Then he drew his sword , and threatened to kill her if she did not obey him , and so compelled her that she promised it.
The person_0 said to the maiden , `` Is what he says true ?"
`` Ah , yes ,"
she answered , `` it must indeed be true , but I will not consent to have the wedding celebrated until after a year and a day ,"
for she thought in that time she should hear something of her dear huntsman.
The humble-bee came a second time , but the hare again rubbed it off and slept on.
Then it came for the third time , and stung his nose so that he awoke.
The bear asked the wolf , `` Why didst thou not waken me ?"
and the wolf the fox , `` Why didst thou not waken me ?"
and the fox the hare , `` Why didst thou not waken me ?"
The poor hare alone did not know what answer to make , and the blame rested with him.
But the mountain lies two hundred hours journey from here"
The lion said , `` In four-and-twenty hours must thou have run thither and have come back , and have brought the root with thee"
Then the hare sprang away , and in four-and-twenty hours he was back , and brought the root with him.
Then he tore the huntsman 's head off again , turned it round , and the hare healed it with the root.
The huntsman , however , was sad at heart , and traveled about the world , and made his animals dance before people.
`` Nay ,"
said the host , `` I would bet a hundred pieces of gold that that will not come true"
The huntsman accepted the wager , and set against it a purse with just the same number of gold pieces.
Then he called the hare and said , `` Go , my dear runner , and fetch me some of the bread which the person_0 is eating"
`` Alas !"
thought he , `` if I bound through the streets thus alone , the butchers ' dogs will all be after me"
It happened as he expected , and the dogs came after him and wanted to make holes in his good skin.
But he sprang away , have you have never seen one running ? and sheltered himself in a sentry-box without the soldier being aware of it.
Then she said , `` Wilt thou get away ?"
and thought it was her dog.
The hare scratched her foot for the second time , and she again said , `` Wilt thou get away ?"
and thought it was her dog.
But the hare did not let itself be turned from its purpose , and scratched her for the third time.
Then she peeped down , and knew the hare by its collar.
She took him on her lap , carried him into her chamber , and said , `` Dear Hare , what dost thou want ?"
Then she was full of joy and had the baker summoned , and ordered him to bring a loaf such as was eaten by the person_0.
The little hare said , `` But the baker must likewise carry it thither for me , that the butchers ' dogs may do no harm to me"
Then said the huntsman , `` Behold , sir host , the hundred pieces of gold are mine"
The host said , `` I should indeed like to see that ,"
but he would make no more wagers.
The huntsman called the fox and said , `` My little fox , go and fetch me some roast meat , such as the person_0 eats"
He answered , `` My master , who killed the dragon , is here , and has sent me.
I am to ask for some roast meat such as the person_0 is eating"
`` Behold , sir host ,"
said the huntsman , `` bread and meat are here but now I will also have proper vegetables with it , such as are eaten by the person_0"
Then he called the wolf , and said , `` Dear Wolf , go thither and fetch me vegetables such as the person_0 eats"
She recognized him by his collar , and took him into her chamber with her , and said , `` Dear Wolf , what dost thou want ?"
He answered , `` My master , who killed the dragon , is here , I am to ask for some vegetables , such as the person_0 eats"
`` Behold , sir host ,"
said the huntsman , `` now I have bread and meat and vegetables , but I will also have some pastry to eat like that which the person_0 eats"
He answered , `` My master , who killed the dragon , is here , and I am to ask for some confectionery , such as the person_0 eats"
`` Behold , sir host ,"
said the huntsman , `` now I have bread , meat , vegetables and confectionery , but I will drink wine also , and such as the person_0 drinks"
Then the lion went to the royal apartment , and knocked at the door with his tail.
Then she bade the cup-bearer be called , who was to give the lion some wine like that which was drunk by the person_0.
The lion said , `` I will go with him , and see that I get the right wine"
and he drew half a measure , and swallowed it down at one draught.
`` No ,"
said he , `` that is not right"
The lion said , `` Stop , let me taste the wine first ,"
and drew half a measure and drank it.
`` That is better , but still not right ,"
said he.
Then the cup-bearer grew angry and said , `` How can a stupid animal like you understand wine ?"
Said the host , `` How can that be , when she already has a betrothed husband , and when the wedding is to be solemnized to-day ?"
The huntsman , however , took a bag with a thousand gold pieces , put it on the table , and said , `` I stake that on it"
She replied , `` I may not tell you , but send and have the master of these animals brought , and you will do well"
Then said he , `` Behold , sir host , now the person_0 sends his servant and invites me , but I do not go in this way"
When the person_0 heard the answer , he said to his daughter , `` What shall I do ?"
She said , `` Cause him to be fetched as he desires to be , and you will do well"
Then the person_0 sent royal apparel , a carriage with six horses , and servants to wait on him.
When the huntsman saw them coming , he said , `` Behold , sir host , now I am fetched as I desired to be ,"
and he put on the royal garments , took the handkerchief with the dragon 's tongues with him , and drove off to the person_0.
When the person_0 saw him coming , he said to his daughter , `` How shall I receive him ?"
She answered , `` Go to meet him and you will do well"
Then the person_0 went to meet him and led him in , and his animals followed.
The the huntsman stood up , opened the seven mouths , and said , `` Where are the seven tongues of the dragon ?"
The huntsman said , `` Liars ought to have none , but the dragon 's tongues are the tokens of the victor ,"
and he unfolded the handkerchief , and there lay all seven inside it.
And he put each tongue in the mouth to which it belonged , and it fitted exactly.
She answered , `` The necklace and golden clasp were mine , but I divided them among the animals who helped to conquer the dragon"
Then spake the huntsman , `` When I , tired with the fight , was resting and sleeping , the marshal came and cut off my head.
Then the person_0 asked his daughter , `` Is it true that this man killed the dragon ?"
And she answered , `` Yes , it is true.
For this reason , however , did I make the condition that the marriage should not be solemnized for a year and a day"
The marshal was therefore executed , but the person_0 gave his daughter to the huntsman , and named him his viceroy over the whole kingdom.
The wedding was celebrated with great joy , and the young person_0 caused his father and his foster-father to be brought , and loaded them with treasures.
The host said , `` Yes , according to justice it is so"
But the young person_0 said , `` It shall be done according to mercy ,"
and told him that he should keep his house and yard , and gave him the thousand pieces of gold as well.
And now the young person_0 and Queen were thoroughly happy , and lived in gladness together.
He often went out hunting because it was a delight to him , and the faithful animals had to accompany him.
and he rode into the forest after it , followed only by his animals.
Then she was in the greatest concern about him.
He looked round , but could perceived nothing.
Said he , `` Come down , and warm thyself if thou art cold"
But she said , `` No , thy animals will bite me"
He answered , `` They will do thee no harm , old mother , do come down"
Then she threw him a small wand , and he struck them with it , and instantly they lay still and were turned into stone.
And when the witch was safe from the animals , she leapt down and touched him also with a wand , and changed him to stone.
Thereupon she laughed , and dragged him and the animals into a vault , where many more such stones already lay.
As , however , the young person_0 did not come back at all , the Queen 's anguish and care grew constantly greater.
And it so happened that at this very time the other brother who had turned to the east when they separated , came into the kingdom.
He had sought a situation , and had found none , and had then traveled about here and there , and had made his animals dance.
When he got there his brother 's side of the knife was half rusted , and half bright.
So he allowed himself to be escorted into the castle by the guard , and was received with the greatest joy.
The young Queen indeed thought that he was her husband , and asked him why he had stayed away so long.
He answered , `` I had lost myself in a forest , and could not find my way out again any sooner"
and then he rode into the forest and his animals ran after him.
But he could not overtake the hart , and got so deep into the forest that he was forced to pass the night there.
And when he had lighted a fire , he heard some one wailing above him , `` Oh , oh , oh , how cold I am !"
Then he looked up , and the self-same witch was sitting in the tree.
Said he , `` If thou art cold , come down , little old mother , and warm thyself"
She answered , `` No , thy animals will bite me"
But he said , `` They will not hurt thee"
Then she cried , `` I will throw down a wand to thee , and if thou smitest them with it they will do me no harm"
When the huntsman heard that , he had no confidence in the old woman , and said , `` I will not strike my animals.
Come down , or I will fetch thee"
Then she cried , `` What dost thou want ? Thou shalt not touch me"
But he replied , `` If thou dost not come , I will shoot thee"
Said she , `` Shoot away , I do not fear thy bullets !"
She was in a great fright , begged for mercy and said , He and his animals lie in a vault , turned to stone.
But when the twin brothers saw each other again , they kissed each other and rejoiced with all their hearts.
Thereupon the two brothers went home together , and on the way told each other their histories.
When the other heard that , he became so jealous and angry that he drew his sword , and struck off his brother 's head.
But when he saw him lying there dead , and saw his red blood flowing , he repented most violently : `` My brother delivered me ,"
cried he , `` and I have killed him for it ,"
and he bewailed him aloud.
The person_0 said , `` It is not possible , the gates lie quite a mile apart"
In the meantime , however , the two brothers entered the courtyard of the palace from opposite sides , and both mounted the steps.
Then the person_0 said to the daughter , `` Say which is thy husband.
Each of them looks exactly like the other , I can not tell"
Then the young person_0 laughed and said , `` Yes , he is the right one ,"
and they sat down together to table , and ate and drank , and were merry.
Then he knew how true his brother had been"
When this story begins they had been married for some years and were blessed with one little daughter.
She was the joy and pride of both their lives , and in her they stored an endless source of happiness for their old age.
There could not be found in the whole of the Island Empire a happier little family.
One day there was much excitement in the home , for the father had been suddenly summoned to the capital on business.
So the wife was very anxious while she helped her husband get ready for the long journey , knowing what an arduous task lay before him.
All was ready at last , and the husband stood in the porch with his little family round him.
`` Do not be anxious , I will come back soon ,"
said the man.
`` While I am away take care of everything , and especially of our little daughter"
`` Yes.
we shall be all right -- but you -- you must take care of yourself and delay not a day in coming back to us ,"
said the wife , while the tears fell like rain from her eyes.
She ran to his side , and caught hold of his long sleeve to keep him a moment.
`` Father , I will be very good while I am waiting for you to come back , so please bring me a present"
But he knew that he must go , for the call was imperative.
With a great effort he ceased to think , and resolutely turning away he went quickly down the little garden and out through the gate.
`` Now father has gone , you and I must take care of everything till he comes back ,"
said the mother , as she made her way back to the house.
`` Yes , I will be very good ,"
`` Father is sure to bring you something that you want very much.
I know , for I asked him to bring you a doll.
You must think of father every day , and pray for a safe journey till he comes back"
`` O , yes , when he comes home again how happy I shall be ,"
said the child , clapping her hands , and her face growing bright with joy at the glad thought.
It seemed to the mother as she looked at the child 's face that her love for her grew deeper and deeper.
Then she set to work to make the winter clothes for the three of them.
She set up her simple wooden spinning-wheel and spun the thread before she began to weave the stuffs.
In the intervals of her work she directed the little girl 's games and taught her to read the old stories of her country.
Thus did the wife find consolation in work during the lonely days of her husband 's absence.
While the time was thus slipping quickly by in the quiet home , the husband finished his business and returned.
It would have been difficult for any one who did not know the man well to recognize him.
Both the man and his wife rejoiced to find each other well.
`` Here ,"
he said to the little girl , `` is a present for you.
It is a prize for taking care of mother and the house so well while I was away"
`` Thank you ,"
The wife took the box , and opening it carefully took out a metal disk with a handle attached.
Never had she seen such a thing in her life , for she had been born and bred in the rural province of Echigo.
The husband laughed and said : `` Why , it is your own face that you see.
What I have brought you is called a mirror , and whoever looks into its clear surface can see their own form reflected there.
There the mirror is considered a very necessary requisite for a woman to possess.
It is also one of the treasures that form the insignia of the Emperor.
So you must lay great store by your mirror , and use it carefully"
The wife listened to all her husband told her , and was pleased at learning so much that was new to her.
She was still more pleased at the precious gift -- his token of remembrance while he had been away.
`` If the mirror represents my soul , I shall certainly treasure it as a valuable possession , and never will I use it carelessly"
The wife saw that her husband was very tired , and set about serving the evening meal and making everything as comfortable as she could for him.
But , alas ! in this world nothing lasts forever.
Even the moon is not always perfect in shape , but loses its roundness with time , and flowers bloom and then fade.
So at last the happiness of this family was broken up by a great sorrow.
The good and gentle wife and mother was one day taken ill.
.
In the first days of her illness the father and daughter thought that it was only a cold , and were not particularly anxious.
The father and daughter were stricken with grief , and day or night the girl never left her mother 's side.
But in spite of all their efforts the woman 's life was not to be saved.
Her breath was labored and she spoke with difficulty : `` My daughter.
I am sure that nothing can save me now.
When I am dead , promise me to take care of your dear father and to try to be a good and dutiful woman"
`` Oh , mother ,"
said the girl as the tears rushed to her eyes , `` you must not say such things.
All you have to do is to make haste and get well -- that will bring the greatest happiness to father and myself"
And now I have something to give you whereby to remember me when I am gone"
Putting her hand out , she took from the side of the pillow a square wooden box tied up with a silken cord and tassels.
Undoing this very carefully , she took out of the box the mirror that her husband had given her years ago.
This I give you before I die.
With these words the dying woman handed the mirror to her daughter.
The mind of the good mother seemed to be now at rest , and sinking back without another word her spirit passed quietly away that day.
The bereaved father and daughter were wild with grief , and they abandoned themselves to their bitter sorrow.
But this frantic burst of grief passed , and then they took possession of their own hearts again , crushed though they were in resignation.
In spite of this the daughter 's life seemed to her desolate.
One day when her father was out , and she was fulfilling her household duties alone , her loneliness and sorrow seemed more than she could bear.
She threw herself down in her mother 's room and wept as if her heart would break.
Suddenly she sat up.
Her mother 's last words had rung through her memory hitherto dulled by grief.
I had nearly forgotten her last words -- how stupid I am ; I will get the mirror now and see if it can possibly be true !"
`` It is certainly my mother 's soul that I see.
She knows how miserable I am without her and she has come to comfort me.
Whenever I long to see her she will meet me here ; how grateful I ought to be !"
And from this time the weight of sorrow was greatly lightened for her young heart.
Instead of lessening his affection for his daughter , as the woman desired , her grumblings only made him think of her the more.
The woman soon saw that he began to show more concern for his lonely child than before.
So crooked did the woman 's heart become.
The woman herself was a little frightened too at what she had seen.
The man was completely taken by surprise at the suddenness of her request , and wondered whatever was the matter.
`` Do you find it so disagreeable ,"
he asked , `` in my house , that you can stay no longer ?"
And the woman began to weep afresh.
`` I will tell you since you ask me.
Your daughter dislikes me as her step-mother.
The husband listened to the dreadful tale , but he could not believe his gentle daughter guilty of such an evil act.
Putting this fact together with his wife 's alarm , he thought that there might be something to account for the strange story.
His heart was torn between doubting his wife and trusting his child , and he knew not what to do.
He decided to go at once to his daughter and try to find out the truth.
Comforting his wife and assuring her that her fears were groundless , he glided quietly to his daughter 's room.
The girl had for a long time past been very unhappy.
But she soon found that her efforts were in vain.
It was the only comfort that she had in these wretched days.
Her father found her occupied in this way.
Pushing aside the fusama , he saw her bending over something or other very intently.
So before turning to her father she slipped the mirror into her long sleeve.
The girl was frightened by her father 's severity.
Never had he spoken to her in such a tone.
Her confusion changed to apprehension , her color from scarlet to white.
She sat dumb and shamefaced , unable to reply.
And the father 's eyes filled with sudden tears to think that he should have to upbraid his daughter in this way.
But she saw that she must speak and clear herself somehow.
She loved her father dearly , and could not bear the idea of his anger.
She put out her hand on his knee deprecatingly : `` Father ! father ! do not say such dreadful things to me.
I am still your obedient child.
Indeed , I am.
As for me I do not know -- no , not so much as a dew-drop , of the evil thing of which you accuse me"
But the father remembered that she had hidden something away when he first entered the room , and even this earnest protest did not satisfy him.
He wished to clear up his doubts once for all.
So she slipped the mirror out from her long sleeve and laid it before him.
`` This ,"
she said , `` is what you saw me looking at just now"
`` Why ,"
he said in great surprise"
Then she told him of her mother 's last words , and of how she had promised to meet her child whenever she looked into the glass.
`` What do you mean ?"
he asked.
`` I do not understand how you can meet the soul of your lost mother by looking in this mirror ?"
`` It is indeed true ,"
said the girl : `` and if you do n't believe what I say , look for yourself ,"
and she placed the mirror before her.
There , looking back from the smooth metal disk , was her own sweet face.
She pointed to the reflection seriously : `` Do you doubt me still ?"
she asked earnestly , looking up into his face.
With an exclamation of sudden understanding the father smote his two hands together.
`` How stupid I am ! At last I understand.
Living in constant remembrance of your lost mother has helped you to grow like her in character.
How clever it was of her to tell you to do this.
Before you I have no countenance left , and I beg you to forgive me"
And here the father wept.
He thought of how lonely the poor girl must have been , and of all that she must have suffered under her step-mother 's treatment.
The step-mother , anxious to know what would happen , had all this while been standing outside the room.
She had grown interested , and had gradually pushed the sliding screen back till she could see all that went on.
At this moment she suddenly entered the room , and dropping to the mats , she bowed her head over her outspread hands before her step-daughter.
`` I am ashamed ! I am ashamed !"
she exclaimed in broken tones.
`` I did not know what n filial child you were.
Through no fault of yours , but with a step-mother 's jealous heart , I have disliked you all the time.
From this day I throw away my old and wicked heart , and in its place I put a new one , clean and full of repentance.
I shall think of you as a child that I have borne myself.
I shall love and cherish you with all my heart , and thus try to make up for all the unhappiness I have caused you.
Thus did the unkind step-mother humble herself and ask forgiveness of the girl she had so wronged.
From this time on , the three lived together as happily as fish in water.
Her patience and goodness were rewarded at last"
He stretched himself out under the bench , did not move a limb , and behaved as if he were stone dead.
person_1s.
Fox went up to her room , shut herself in , and her maid , Miss Cat , sat by the fire , and did the cooking.
When it became known that the old fox was dead , wooers presented themselves.
The maid heard some one standing at the house-door , knocking.
`` No , thank you , miss ,"
said the fox , `` what is person_1s.
Fox doing ?"
The maid replied , `` She sits all alone , And makes her moan , Weeping her little eyes quite red , Because old person_1.
Fox is dead"
`` Do just tell her , miss , that a young fox is here , who would like to woo her"
`` Certainly , young sir"
The cat goes up the stairs trip , trap , The door she knocks at tap , tap , tap , `` Mistress Fox , are you inside ?"
`` Oh yes , my little cat ,"
she cried.
`` A wooer he stands at the door out there"
`` Tell me what he is like , my dear ?"
`` But has he nine as beautiful tails as the late person_1.
Fox ?"
`` Oh , no ,"
answered the cat , `` he has only one"
`` Then I will not have him"
Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away.
Soon afterwards there was another knock , and another fox was at the door who wished to woo person_1s.
Fox.
He had two tails , but he did not fare better than the first.
Fox.
When the widow heard that , she said joyfully to the cat , `` Now open the gates and doors all wide , And carry old person_1.
Fox outside"
But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized , old person_1.
Fox stirred under the bench , and cudgelled all the rabble , and drove them and person_1s.
Fox out of the house.
SECOND STORY When old person_1.
Fox was dead , the wolf came as a wooer , and knocked at the door , and the cat who was servant to person_1s.
Fox , opened it for him.
The wolf greeted her , and said , `` Good day , person_1s.
Cat of Kehrewit , `` How comes it that alone you sit ? What are you making good ?"
The cat replied , `` In milk I 'm breaking bread so sweet , Will the gentleman please come in and eat ?"
`` No , thank you , person_1s.
Cat ,"
answered the wolf.
`` Is person_1s.
Fox not at home ?"
The cat said , `` She sits upstairs in her room , Bewailing her sorrowful doom , Bewailing her trouble so sore , For old person_1.
Fox is no more"
The wolf answered , `` If she 's in want of a husband now , Then will it please her to step below ?"
The cat runs quickly up the stair , And lets her tail fly here and there , Until she comes to the parlor door.
Fox asked , `` Has the gentleman red stockings on ' and has he a pointed mouth ?"
`` No ,"
answered the cat.
`` Then he wo n't do for me"
But one of the good points which old person_1.
Fox had possessed , was always lacking , and the cat had continually to send the wooers away.
At length came a young fox.
Then person_1s.
Fox said , `` Has the gentleman red stockings on , and has he a little pointed mouth ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the cat , `` he has"
`` Then let him come upstairs ,"
said person_1s.
Fox , and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding-feast.
Then the wedding was solemnized with young person_1.
Fox , and there was much rejoicing and dancing ; and if they have not left off , they are dancing still"
`` What !"
`` I am Death ,"
answered the other.
`` No one resists me , and thou also must obey my commands"
But the giant refused , and began to struggle with Death.
The giant went his way , and Death lay there conquered , and so weak that he could not get up again.
`` What will be done now ,"
In the meantime a young man came along the road , who was strong and healthy , singing a song , and glancing around on every side.
`` Dost thou know ,"
said the stranger , whilst he was getting up , `` who I am , and who it is whom thou hast helped on his legs again ?"
`` No ,"
answered the youth , `` I do not know thee"
`` I am Death ,"
said he.
`` Well ,"
said the youth , `` it is something gained that I shall know when thou comest , and at any rate be safe from thee for so long"
Then he went on his way , and was light-hearted , and enjoyed himself , and lived without thought.
`` Die , I shall not ,"
said he to himself , `` for Death will send his messengers before that , but I do wish these wretched days of sickness were over"
As soon as he felt himself well again he began once more to live merrily.
Then one day some one tapped him on the shoulder.
He looked round , and Death stood behind him , and said , `` Follow me , the hour of thy departure from this world has come"
`` What ,"
`` Silence !"
answered Death.
`` I come from Rome ,"
said the Moon.
`` In the midst of the city , upon one of the seven hills , lie the ruins of the imperial palace.
Of the splendid throne-hall only a naked wall yet stands , and a black cypress throws its dark shadow on the spot where the throne once stood.
Peter 's.
`` On this evening , as usual , stillness reigned around ; and in the full beam of my light came the little granddaughter.
On her head she carried an earthen pitcher of antique shape filled with water.
Her feet were bare , her short frock and her white sleeves were torn.
I kissed her pretty round shoulders , her dark eyes , and black shining hair.
She mounted the stairs ; they were steep , having been made up of rough blocks of broken marble and the capital of a fallen pillar.
The colored lizards slipped away , startled , from before her feet , but she was not frightened at them.
Already she lifted her hand to pull the door-bell -- a hare 's foot fastened to a string formed the bell-handle of the imperial palace.
Presently she moved again -- she stumbled ; the earthen vessel fell from her head , and broke on the marble steps.
She burst into tears.
There was once a man who had seven sons , and still he had no daughter , however much he wished for one.
At length his wife again gave him hope of a child , and when it came into the world it was a girl.
The joy was great , but the child was sickly and small , and had to be privately baptized on account of its weakness.
The father sent one of the boys in haste to the spring to fetch water for the baptism.
The other six went with him , and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it , the jug fell into the well.
There they stood and did not know what to do , and none of them dared to go home.
As they still did not return , the father grew impatient , and said , `` They have certainly forgotten it for some game , the wicked boys !"
Hardly was the word spoken before he heard a whirring of wings over his head in the air , looked up and saw seven coal-black ravens flying away.
But the maiden took it to heart daily , and thought she must deliver her brothers.
And now she went continually onwards , far , far to the very end of the world.
Then she came to the sun , but it was too hot and terrible , and devoured little children.
The maiden took the drumstick , wrapped it carefully in a cloth , and went onwards again until she came to the Glass mountain.
What was she now to do ? She wished to rescue her brothers , and had no key to the Glass mountain.
The good sister took a knife , cut off one of her little fingers , put it in the door , and succeeded in opening it.
When she had gone inside , a little dwarf came to meet her , who said , `` My child , what are you looking for ?"
`` I am looking for my brothers , the seven ravens ,"
she replied.
The dwarf said , `` The lord ravens are not at home , but if you will wait here until they come , step in"
Suddenly she heard a whirring of wings and a rushing through the air , and then the little dwarf said , `` Now the lord ravens are flying home"
Then they came , and wanted to eat and drink , and looked for their little plates and glasses.
And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass , the ring rolled against his mouth.
And they embraced and kissed each other , and went joyfully home"
`` I looked through the windows of an editor 's house ,"
said the Moon.
`` It was somewhere in Germany.
I saw handsome furniture , many books , and a chaos of newspapers.
` This one has been sent to me , ' said he.
The verses might be better , to be sure ; the thoughts are sound , though there is certainly a good deal of commonplace among them.
But what will you have ? You ca n't be always getting something new.
That he 'll turn out anything great I do n't believe , but you may safely praise him.
He is well read , a remarkable Oriental scholar , and has a good judgment.
It was he who wrote that nice review of my ` Reflections on Domestic Life.
' We must be lenient towards the young man.
'"
` But he is a complete hack ! ' objected another of the gentlemen.
` Nothing is worse in poetry than mediocrity , and he certainly does not go beyond this.
'"
` Poor fellow , ' observed a third , ` and his aunt is so happy about him.
It was she , Mr.
Editor , who got together so many subscribers for your last translation.
'"
` Ah , the good woman ! Well , I have noticed the book briefly.
Undoubted talent -- a welcome offering -- a flower in the garden of poetry -- prettily brought out -- and so on.
But this other book -- I suppose the author expects me to purchase it ? I hear it is praised.
He has genius , certainly ; do n't you think so ? '"
` Yes , all the world declares as much , ' replied the poet , ` but it has turned out rather wildly.
The punctuation of the book , in particular , is very eccentric.
'"
'"
` But that would be unfair , ' objected the fourth.
` Let us not carp at little faults , but rejoice over the real and abundant good that we find here : he surpasses all the rest.
'"
` Not so.
If he is a true genius , he can bear the sharp voice of censure.
There are people enough to praise him.
Do n't let us quite turn his head.
'"
` Decided talent , ' wrote the editor , ` with the usual carelessness.
That he can write incorrect verses may be seen in page 25 , where there are two false quantities.
We recommend him to study the ancients , etc.
' `` I went away ,"
continued the Moon , `` and looked through the windows in the aunt 's house.
There sat the be-praised poet , the _ tame _ one ; all the guests paid homage to him , and he was happy.
But it must be allowed that , as a man , you are highly respectable.
' `` A young girl sat in a corner ; and she read in a book these words :"
` In the dust lies genius and glory , But ev ` ry-day talent will _ pay _.
It 's only the old , old story , But the piece is repeated each day.
'"
Then he said to them , `` Go forth , and he who brings me the most beautiful carpet shall be King after my death"
He sat down and was sad , then all at once he saw that there was a trap-door close by the feather.
The door opened , and he saw a great , fat toad sitting , and round about her a crowd of little toads.
The fat toad asked what he wanted ? He answered , `` I should like to have the prettiest and finest carpet in the world"
Then she called a young one and said , `` Little green maiden small , Hopping hither and thither , Hop quickly and bring me The great box here"
Then he thanked her , and ascended again.
The two others had , however , looked on their youngest brother as so stupid that they believed he would find and bring nothing at all.
`` Why should we give ourselves a great deal of trouble to search ?"
said they , and got some coarse handkerchiefs from the first shepherds ' wives whom they met , and carried them home to the King.
Then the father said , `` He who brings me the most beautiful ring shall inherit the kingdom ,"
and led the three brothers out , and blew into the air three feathers , which they were to follow.
Then he went down again to the fat toad , and told her that he wanted the most beautiful ring.
The two eldest laughed at Simpleton for going to seek a golden ring.
He again blew the three feathers into the air , and they flew as before.
Then Simpleton without more ado went down to the fat toad , and said , `` I am to take home the most beautiful woman !"
`` Oh ,"
answered the toad , `` the most beautiful woman ! She is not at hand at the moment , but still thou shalt have her"
She gave him a yellow turnip which had been hollowed out , to which six mice were harnessed.
Then Simpleton said quite mournfully , `` What am I to do with that ?"
The toad answered , `` Just put one of my little toads into it"
So he kissed her , and drove off quickly with the horses , and took her to the King.
When the King saw them he said , `` After my death the kingdom belongs to my youngest son"
But the two eldest deafened the King 's ears afresh with their clamor , `` We can not consent to Simpleton 's being King ,"
and demanded that the one whose wife could leap through a ring which hung in the center of the hall should have the preference.
They thought , `` The peasant women can do that easily ; they are strong enough , but the delicate maiden will jump herself to death"
The aged King agreed likewise to this.
So he received the crown , and has ruled wisely for a length of time"
A countryman was once going out to plough with a pair of oxen.
I call that well sold ! The peasant now went home , and carried the measure of turnip-seed to him on his back.
On the way , however , he lost one seed out of the bag.
The butcher paid him justly as agreed on , and if the peasant had not lost the seed , he would have had one thaler the more.
In the meantime , when he went on his way back , the seed had grown into a tree which reached up to the sky.
So he climbed up , and saw that the angels above were threshing oats , and he looked on.
`` If I were to fall down from hence it would be a bad thing ,"
He likewise snatched a hoe and a flail which were lying about in heaven , and let himself down by the rope.
But he came down on the earth exactly in the middle of a deep , deep hole.
There was once on a time a far-sighted , crafty peasant whose tricks were much talked about.
The best story is , however , how he once got hold of the Devil , and made a fool of him.
`` Thou dost indeed sit upon a treasure !"
said the peasant.
`` Yes , in truth ,"
replied the Devil , `` on a treasure which contains more gold and silver than thou hast ever seen in thy life !"
`` The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me ,"
said the peasant.
`` It is thine ,"
answered the Devil , `` if thou wilt for two years give me the half of everything thy field produces.
Money I have enough of , but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth"
The peasant agreed to the bargain.
`` In order , however , that no dispute may arise about the division ,"
said he , `` everything that is above ground shall belong to thee , and what is under the earth to me"
The Devil was quite satisfied with that , but the cunning peasant had sown turnips.
`` Thou hast had the best of it for once ,"
said the Devil , `` but the next time that wo n't do.
What grows above ground shall be thine , and what is under it , mine"
`` I am willing ,"
replied the peasant ; but when the time came to sow , he did not again sow turnips , but wheat.
The grain became ripe , and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks down to the ground.
When the Devil came , he found nothing but the stubble , and went away in a fury down into a cleft in the rocks.
`` That is the way to cheat the Devil ,"
said the peasant , and went and fetched away the treasure"
and with that he chased him into the open country.
The horse was sad , and went to the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather.
Then the fox met him and said , `` Why dost thou hang thy head so , and go about all alone ?"
`` Alas ,"
replied the horse , `` avarice and fidelity do not dwell together in one house.
`` Without giving thee a chance ?"
asked the fox.
`` The chance was a bad one.
The fox said , `` I will help thee , just lay thyself down , stretch thyself out , as if thou wert dead , and do not stir"
This advice pleased the lion : he lay down , and in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to him , he kept quite quiet.
When he had finished his work , he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said , `` Pull , white horse , pull"
Then up sprang the horse at once , and drew the lion away with him.
and he gave him plenty to eat until he died"
There were once a cock and a hen who wanted to take a journey together.
So the cock built a beautiful carriage , which had four red wheels , and harnessed four mice to it.
The hen seated herself in it with the cock , and they drove away together.
Not long afterwards they met a cat who said , `` Where are you going ?"
The cock replied , `` We are going to the house of Herr Korbes"
`` Take me with you ,"
said the cat.
The cock answered , `` Most willingly , get up behind , lest you fall off in front.
Take great care not to dirty my little red wheels.
And you little wheels , roll on , and you little mice pipe out , as we go forth on our way to the house of Herr Korbes"
When , however , they reached the house of Herr Korbes , Herr Korbes was not there.
The mice drew the carriage into the barn , the hen flew with the cock upon a perch.
The cat sat down by the hearth , the duck on the well-pole.
He ran into the kitchen in a great hurry to wash it off , and the duck splashed some water in his face.
He wanted to dry it with the towel , but the egg rolled up against him , broke , and glued up his eyes.
He wanted to rest , and sat down in the chair , and then the pin pricked him.
Herr Korbes must have been a very wicked man !"
SAID one , a princely husband I have got.
For pleasure never gives me full delight , Unless a little pain the bliss invite.
With neither of you , husband or gallant , Would I exchange , though these so much you vaunt.
And then , good upright Macae shall decide ; Thus things arrang 'd , the ladies homeward plied.
To grant the master 's wish the girl was led , And they together hurried off to bed.
This , howsoe'er , to get you 're not design 'd , So elsewhere you may try what you can find.
Here ends the trick our wily gossip play 'd ; But now let 's see the plot another laid.
Down William came.
How ? said the master , how ? Are we at play ? William Not now , sir , no , not now.
Wife ` Twere surely better if thou held ` st thy tongue , Or thou ` lt a beating get before ` tis long.
Husband No , no , my dear , he 's mad , and I design The fellow in a madhouse to confine.
How ! how ! -- cried he : -- what , e ` en before my sight ? What can you mean ? said she without affright.
Wife Too much is this : -- such accusations grieve.
Husband Thou did ` st most clearly suffer his embrace.
Wife I ? WHY , you dream ! Husband This seems a curious case.
To find the cause , said he , no longer try , The tree 's enchanted , we may well rely.
Down hew it , cried the lady , that 's your task ; More concerns you not ; folly ` tis to ask.
Be that as ` twill , to-night from hence you go.
My dear , said Berlinguier , I 'd fain say no ; Let things remain until to-morrow , pray And then my lady presently gave way.
THE case hangs up , and there will long remain ; ` Tis often thus when justice we 'd obtain :"
Thus thought he , and after all the funeral obsequies of his father were over , took leave of his elder brother , and started for Benares.
While passing that desert he had to journey for a couple of days through a sandy plain , with no signs of life or vegetation.
The little store of provision with which he was provided for a couple of days , at last was exhausted.
There was not a morsel in his hand to eat ; nor a drop of water to drink.
Turn his eyes wherever he might he found a vast desert , out of which he saw no means of escape.
Still he thought within himself , `` Surely my father 's prophecy never proved untrue.
I must survive this calamity to find my death on some sea-coast"
At last he succeeded ; heaven threw in his way a ruined well.
He thought he could collect some water if he let down his chombu with the string that he always carried noosed to the neck of it.
For the last three days I have had nothing.
Fortune has sent you here.
If you assist me now you will find a sure help in me throughout your life.
Do not think that I am a beast of prey.
When you have become my deliverer I will never touch you.
Pray , kindly lift me up"
person_0 thought : `` Shall I take him out or not ? If I take him out he may make me the first morsel of his hungry mouth.
No ; that he will not do.
For my father 's prophecy never came untrue.
I must die on a sea coast , and not by a tiger"
Thus thinking , he asked the tiger-king to hold tight to the vessel , which he accordingly did , and he lifted him up slowly.
The tiger reached the top of the well and felt himself on safe ground.
True to his word , he did no harm to person_0.
In return for this kind assistance I pledge my oath to stand by you in all calamities.
Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me.
I am there with you ready to oblige you by all the means that I can.
I chased him.
He , finding it impossible to escape my claws , jumped into this well , and is living to this moment in the very bottom of it.
I also jumped in , but found myself on the first ledge of the well ; he is on the last and fourth ledge.
In the second lives a serpent half-famished with hunger.
On the third lies a rat , also half-famished , and when you again begin to draw water these may request you first to release them.
In the same way the goldsmith also may ask you.
I beg you , as your bosom friend , never assist that wretched man , though he is your relation as a human being.
Goldsmiths are never to be trusted.
But never trust a goldsmith.
Do not release him ; and if you do , you shall surely repent of it one day or other"
Thus advising , the hungry tiger went away without waiting for an answer.
person_0 thought several times of the eloquent way in which the tiger spoke , and admired his fluency of speech.
But still his thirst was not quenched.
I am the king of serpents , and the son of Adisesha , who is now pining away in agony for my disappearance.
Release me now.
I shall ever remain your servant , remember your assistance , and help you throughout life in all possible ways.
Oblige me : I am dying"
person_0 , calling again to mind the `` DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE"
of the prophecy lifted him up.
I was three days ago basking myself in the morning sun , when I saw a rat running before me.
I chased him.
He fell into this well.
I followed him , but instead of falling on the third storey where he is now lying , I fell into the second.
I am going away now to see my father.
Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me.
I will be there by your side to assist you by all possible means"
So saying , the Nagaraja glided away in zigzag movements , and was out of sight in a moment.
The poor son of the Soothsayer , who was now almost dying of thirst , let down his vessel for a third time.
The rat caught hold of it , and without discussing he lifted up the poor animal at once.
Whenever you are in any calamity just think of me.
I will come to you , and assist you.
My keen ears overheard all that the tiger-king told you about the goldsmith , who is in the fourth storey.
It is nothing but a sad truth that goldsmiths ought never to be trusted.
Therefore , never assist him as you have done to us all.
And if you do , you will suffer for it.
I am hungry ; let me go for the present"
Thus taking leave of his benefactor , the rat , too , ran away.
So thinking to himself , person_0 let down the vessel again.
The goldsmith caught hold of it , and demanded help.
The Soothsayer 's son had no time to lose ; he was himself dying of thirst.
Therefore he lifted the goldsmith up , who now began his story.
`` Stop for a while ,"
I am just now dying of hunger.
Permit me to go away.
My name is Manikkasari.
Do not forget to come to me and receive my kind remembrances of your assistance , on your way back to your country"
So saying , the goldsmith took his leave , and person_0 also pursued his way north after the above adventures.
He reached Benares , and lived there for more than ten years , and quite forgot the tiger , serpent , rat , and goldsmith.
After ten years of religious life , thoughts of home and of his brother rushed into his mind.
`` I have secured enough merit now by my religious observances.
Let me return home"
Thus thought person_0 within himself , and very soon he was on his way back to his country.
Remembering the prophecy of his father he returned by the same way by which he went to Benares ten years before.
While thus retracing his steps he reached the ruined well where he had released the three brute kings and the gold smith.
At once the old recollections rushed into his mind , and he thought of the tiger to test his fidelity.
I can never forget the day when I owed my life to your lotus hands.
I have several jewels with me of little value.
person_0 was extremely delighted at the faithfulness with which the brute beasts behaved , and went on his way to the south.
While going along he spoke to himself thus : `` These beasts have been very faithful in their assistance.
Much more , therefore , must Manikkasari be faithful.
I do not want anything from him now.
If I take this crown with me as it is , it occupies much space in my bundle.
It may also excite the curiosity of some robbers on the way.
I will go now to Ujjaini on my way.
Manikkasari requested me to see him without failure on my return journey.
I shall do so , and request him to have the crown melted , the diamonds and gold separated.
He must do that kindness at least for me.
I shall then roll up these diamonds and gold ball in my rags , and wend my way homewards"
Thus thinking and thinking , he reached Ujjaini.
At once he inquired for the house of his goldsmith friend , and found him without difficulty.
All of a sudden the tiger-king started from the wood , seized the king , and vanished.
Still , he resolved to denounce person_0 as the king 's murderer , so , hiding the crown under his garments , he flew to the palace.
He went before the prince and informed him that the assassin was caught , and placed the crown before him.
The prince took it into his hands , examined it , and at once gave half the kingdom to Manikkasari , and then inquired about the murderer.
`` He is bathing in the river , and is of such and such appearance ,"
was the reply.
In a minute , without knowing the cause , the poor Brahman found himself in the dark dungeon.
Such was the cellar into which person_0 was thrust.
What were his thoughts when he reached that place ? `` It is of no use to accuse either the goldsmith or the prince now.
We are all the children of fate.
We must obey her commands.
This is but the first day of my father 's prophecy.
So far his statement is true.
But how pass ten years ? That can not be , and I must die.
Before death comes let me think of my faithful brute friends"
So pondered person_0 in the dark cell underground , and at that moment thought of his three friends.
They held their council , and decided to make an underground passage from the inside of a ruined well to the dungeon.
The rat raja issued an order at once to that effect to his army.
They , with their teeth , bored the ground a long way to the walls of the prison.
After reaching it they found that their teeth could not work on the hard stones.
Thus a passage was effected.
The rat raja entered first to condole with his protector on his misfortune , and undertook to supply his protector with provisions.
`` Whatever sweetmeats or bread are prepared in any house , one and all of you must try to bring whatever you can to our benefactor.
Whatever clothes you find hanging in a house , cut down , dip the pieces in water , and bring the wet bits to our benefactor.
He will squeeze them and gather water for drink ! and the bread and sweetmeats shall form his food"
Having issued these orders , the king of the rats took leave of person_0.
They , in obedience to their king 's order , continued to supply him with provisions and water.
The king of the rats has promised to do his best to provide you with food.
We would now do what we can for your release.
From this day we shall issue orders to our armies to oppress all the subjects of this kingdom.
The deaths by snake-bite and tigers shall increase a hundredfold from this day , and day by day it shall continue to increase till your release.
From that day these calamities have broken out in his dominions.
If I were released I would save all by my powers of healing poisonous wounds and by incantations.
' Some one may report this to the king , and if he knows it , you will obtain your liberty"
Thus comforting his protector in trouble , he advised him to pluck up courage , and took leave of him.
From that day tigers and serpents , acting under the orders of their kings , united in killing as many persons and cattle as possible.
Every day people were carried away by tigers or bitten by serpents.
Thus passed months and years.
These delicacies had completely changed his body into a red , stout , huge , unwieldy mass of flesh.
Thus passed full ten years , as prophesied in the horoscope.
Ten complete years rolled away in close imprisonment.
On the last evening of the tenth year one of the serpents got into the bed-chamber of the princess and sucked her life.
She breathed her last.
She was the only daughter of the king.
The king at once sent for all the snake-bite curers.
He promised half his kingdom and his daughter 's hand to him who would restore her to life.
Now a servant of the king who had several times overheard person_0 's cries , reported the matter to him.
The king at once ordered the cell to be examined.
There was the man sitting in it.
How had he managed to live so long in the cell ? Some whispered that he must be a divine being.
Thus they discussed , while they brought person_0 to the king.
The king no sooner saw person_0 than he fell on the ground.
He was struck by the majesty and grandeur of his person.
His ten years ' imprisonment in the deep cell underground had given a sort of lustre to his body.
His hair had first to be cut before his face could be seen.
The king begged forgiveness for his former fault , and requested him to revive his daughter.
were the only words that person_0 spoke.
Cartloads of corpses of men and cattle began to come in every minute.
Even graves , it is said , were broken open , and corpses buried a day or two before were taken out and sent for their revival.
All rose up as if from deep slumber , and went to their respective homes.
The princess , too , was restored to life.
The joy of the king knew no bounds.
person_0 would not accept anything , but asked the king to assemble all his subjects in a wood near the town.
`` I shall there call in all the tigers and serpents , and give them a general order"
People began to take to their heels at the sight of tigers.
person_0 assured them of safety , and stopped them.
For who else by a single word could thus command vast armies of tigers and serpents , said some among the people.
`` Care not for it ; it may be by magic.
That is not a great thing.
That he revived cartloads of corpses shows him to be surely person_0 ,"
said others.
`` Why should you , my children , thus trouble these poor subjects of Ujjaini ? Reply to me , and henceforth desist from your ravages"
I was the messenger of death sent to deal the blow on his neck.
I did it , and gave the crown to your honor.
The prince makes no inquiry , and at once imprisons your honor.
How can we expect justice from such a stupid king as that ? Unless he adopt a better standard of justice we will go on with our destruction"
The serpent-king and tiger-king also promised to observe their oath as long as justice prevailed , and took their leave.
The gold-smith fled for his life.
He was caught by the soldiers of the king , and was pardoned by the generous person_0 , whose voice now reigned supreme.
All returned to their homes.
The king again pressed person_0 to accept the hand of his daughter.
He agreed to do so , not then , but some time afterwards.
He wished to go and see his elder brother first , and then to return and marry the princess.
The king agreed ; and person_0 left the city that very day on his way home.
It so happened that unwittingly he took a wrong road , and had to pass near a sea-coast.
His elder brother was also on his way up to Benares by that very same route.
They met and recognized each other , even at a distance.
They flew into each other 's arms.
Both remained still for a time almost unconscious with joy.
The pleasure of person_0 was so great that he died of joy.
The elder brother was a devout worshipper of Ganesa.
That was a Friday , a day very sacred to that god.
The elder brother took the corpse to the nearest Ganesa temple and called upon him.
The god came , and asked him what he wanted.
`` My poor brother is dead and gone ; and this is his corpse.
Kindly keep it in your charge till I finish worshipping you.
If I leave it anywhere else the devils may snatch it away when I am absent worshipping you ; after finishing the rites I shall burn him"
Thus said the elder brother , and , giving the corpse to the god Ganesa , he went to prepare himself for that deity 's ceremonials.
Ganesa made over the corpse to his Ganas , asking them to watch over it carefully.
But instead of that they devoured it.
The elder brother , after finishing the puja , demanded his brother 's corpse of the god.
The god called his Ganas , who came to the front blinking , and fearing the anger of their master.
The god was greatly enraged.
The elder brother was very angry.
Ganesa was much ashamed at the remark.
So he , by his divine power , gave him a living person_0 instead of the dead corpse.
Thus was the second son of the Soothsayer restored to life.
The brothers had a long talk about each other 's adventures.
They both went to Ujjaini , where person_0 married the princess , and succeeded to the throne of that kingdom.
He reigned for a long time , conferring several benefits upon his brother.
And so the horoscope was fully fulfilled"
A mortal was allowed these charms to view , Which others ' eyes could never dare pursue.
Such treasures were for gods , or rather kings The privilege of both are beauteous things.
THESE thoughts induced the queen revenge to seek ; Rage moved her breast , and shame possessed her cheek.
Besides , he was a husband , which is worse With these each sin receives a double curse.
Ne'er from the narrative the object swerved ; And scarcely can I fancy , better light The DOCTOR will afford to what I write.
A tempting journey truly it appears , For youths from twenty on to thirty years.
He criticised whatever passed around , And oft , at others ' cost , diversion found.
I 'd have you know , we 've creatures who devise , To horn their husbands under Argus ' eyes.
` Tis very common ; only try around , And soon you 'll find , that sly amours abound.
Perhaps 'twas otherwise , for ev ` ry wight ; In this , to play the Gascon , thinks it right.
Beneath their veils were beauteous sparkling eyes ; The holy-water scarcely would suffice.
WHEN home , an aged female to him came , And soon a meeting place he heard her name.
That 's right , replied the doctor , have your freak ; The lady howsoe'er I now could name.
By this time I 'm convinced her loving spouse.
The place of meeting is a room below , Most nicely furnished , rich , but void of show.
Said she , unless I tell her first you 're here , I dare not let you in her room appear.
Besides , you have not got the right attire ; Undressed , in truth , is what she would desire.
There was a young roc in it just ready to be hatched , and the bill of it began to appear.
I had earnestly persuaded them not to meddle with the egg , but they would not listen to me.
Scarcely had they made an end of their feast , when there appeared in the air , at a considerable distance from us , two great clouds.
We made haste to do so , and set sail with all possible diligence.
In the meantime the two rocs approached with a frightful noise , which they redoubled when they saw the egg broken , and their young one gone.
They returned , and we observed that each of them carried between their talons stones , or rather rocks , of a monstrous size.
The other roc , to our misfortune , threw the stone so exactly upon the middle of the ship that it split into a thousand pieces.
The mariners and passengers were all killed by the stone , or sunk.
I overcame that difficulty however , and got ashore.
It seemed to be a delicious garden.
I found trees everywhere , some of them bearing green and others ripe fruits , and streams of fresh pure water , with pleasant windings and turnings.
I ate of the fruits , which I found excellent , and drank of the water , which was very pleasant.
When I was a little advanced into the island , I saw an old man who appeared very weak and feeble.
He sat upon the bank of a stream , and at first I took him to be one who had been shipwrecked like myself.
I went towards him and saluted him , but he only bowed his head a little.
Every morning he pushed me to make me wake , and afterwards obliged me to get up and walk , and pressed me with his feet.
You may judge then what trouble I was in , to be loaded with such a burden as I could by no means rid myself of.
I gave him the calabash , and the liquor pleasing his palate , he drank it all off.
He became drunk immediately , and the fumes getting up into his head he began to sing after his manner , and to dance upon my shoulders.
They were extremely surprised to see me , and to hear the particulars of my adventures.
' Having thus spoken , he gave me provisions for the journey , and I went with them.
The merchants with whom I was gathered stones , and threw them at the apes on the top of the trees.
' I thanked him for his good advice , and gathered together as many cocoa-nuts as amounted to a considerable sum.
The vessel in which I came sailed with merchants who loaded her with cocoa-nuts.
I expected the arrival of another , whose merchants landed speedily for the like loading.
We set sail towards the islands where pepper grows in great plenty.
I exchanged my cocoa-nuts in those two islands for pepper and wood of aloes , and went with other merchants pearl - fishing.
I hired divers , who fetched me up those that were very large and pure.
They found it at last , but we had no reason to rejoice at it.
We were all seized with extraordinary fear when we saw the captain quit his post , and cry out.
He threw off his turban , pulled his beard , and beat his head like a madman.
We asked him the reason , and he answered that he was in the most dangerous place in all the sea.
Pray to God to deliver us from this danger ; we can not escape it if He does not take pity on us.
' His discourse afflicted us sorely , and we embraced each other with tears in our eyes , bewailing our deplorable lot.
The mountain at the foot of which we were cast was the coast of a very long and large island.
It is also impossible to tell what a quantity of goods and riches we found cast ashore there.
All these objects served only to augment our grief.
What is most remarkable in this place is that the stones of the mountain are of crystal , rubies , or other precious stones.
Here also grow trees , most of which are wood of aloes , equal in goodness to those of Comari.
We continued upon the shore , like men out of their senses , and expected death every day.
Those who died first were interred by the rest ; and , for my part , I paid the last duty to all my companions.
If I make a raft , and leave myself to the current , it will bring me to some inhabited country , or drown me.
When I had finished it I loaded it with some bales of rubies , emeralds , ambergris , rock-crystal , and rich stuffs.
As soon as I came into the cave I lost all light , and the stream carried me I knew not whither.
All this while I ate nothing but what was just necessary to support nature ; yet , notwithstanding this frugality , all my provisions were spent.
Then a pleasing sleep fell upon me.
I got up as soon as I saw them and saluted them.
They spoke to me , but I did not understand their language.
I told them I was ready to do whatever they pleased.
We marched thus altogether , till we came to the city of Serendib , for it was in that island I landed.
The prince ordered me to rise up , received me with an obliging air , and made me come up , and sit down near him.
' All the answer I returned was prayers for the prosperity of this prince , and commendations of his generosity and bounty.
He charged one of his officers to take care of me , and ordered people to serve me at his own charge.
The officer was very faithful in the execution of his orders , and caused all the goods to be carried to the lodgings provided for me.
We desire the same part in your friendship , considering that we believe it to be our merit , being of the same dignity with yourself.
We conjure you this in the rank of a brother.
Farewell.
Thirdly , fifty thousand drachms of the best wood of aloes , with thirty grains of camphor as big as pistachios.
And fourthly , a she-slave of ravishing beauty , whose apparel was covered all over with jewels.
I gave an account of the reason of my coming , and was immediately conducted to the throne of the caliph.
I made my reverence , and after a short speech gave him the letter and present.
There is nothing more capable of raising a man 's admiration than the magnificence of his palace.
And the officer in front replies , `` Praise be to Him who lives for ever"
` Further , the King of Serendib is so just that there are no judges in his dominions.
His people have no need of them.
They understand and observe justice of themselves.
' The caliph was much pleased with my discourse.
' Having spoken thus he dismissed me , and sent me home with a rich present"
To show that monks are knaves in Virtue 's mask ; Pray read my tale : -- no other proof I ask.
A HERMIT , full of youth , was thought around , A saint , and worthy of the legend found.
The holy man a knotted cincture wore ; But , ` neath his garb : -- heart-rotten to the core.
Those times are o ` er ; then Hymen came alone ; But now a lawyer in his train is shown.
OUR anchorite , in begging through the place ; This girl beheld , -- but not with eyes of grace.
Said he , she 'll do , and , if thou manag ` st right , Lucius , at times , with her to pass the night.
No time he lost , his wishes to secure : The means , we may suppose , not over pure.
QUITE near the open fields they lived , I 've said ; An humble , boarded cottage o ` er their head.
HE spoke to them so very loud and clear , They heard , though ` neath the clothes half dead with fear.
Indeed ? the girl replied ; well , let 's away , And we 'll return to bed without delay.
To be precipitate , in such a case , Perhaps might lead at once to dire disgrace.
If thou wert terrified and did ` st not hear , Myself I 'm sure was quite o ` ercome with fear.
No , no , rejoined the daughter , I am right : I clearly heard , dear mother , spite of fright.
Well then , replied the widow , let us pray , That we by Satan be not led astray.
AT length they both arose when morning came , And through the day the converse was the same.
At night howe'er the horn was heard once more , And terrified the females as before.
With trembling knees and blushes o ` er the face , The widow now explained the mystick case.
Six steps behind , the beauteous daughter stood , And waited the decree she thought so good.
The hypocrite howe'er the hermit played , And sent these humble pilgrims back dismayed.
Ah ! mother , said the girl , ` tis my belief , Our many heavy sins have caused thus grief.
The mother with him let her girl remain , And hastened to her humble roof again.
The belle complying looked : -- he took her arm , And soon familiar grew with ev ` ry charm.
O HYPOCRITES ! how oft your wily art Deceives the world and causes poignant smart.
AT matins they so very often met , Some awkward indications caused regret.
You 'll tell me whence so much discernment came ? From this same play : -- the tree of art by name.
For sev ` n long months the nymph her visits paid ; Her inexperience doubtless wanted aid.
BUT when the mother saw her daughter 's case , She made her thank the monk , and leave the place.
The hermit blessed the Lord for what was done ; A pleasant course his humble slave had run.
He told the mother and her daughter fair , The child , by God 's permission , gifts would share.
This long prediction o ` er : with features grave , His benediction to them both he gave.
I rose from the table , and went to him.
` The caliph , ' said he , ` has sent me to tell you that he must speak with you.
' I followed the officer to the palace , where , being presented to the caliph , I saluted him by prostrating myself at his feet.
It is but just I should return his civility.
' This command of the caliph to me was like a clap of thunder.
I have also made a vow never to go out of person_0.
' Here I took occasion to give him a large and particular account of all my adventures , which he had the patience to hear out.
You have nothing to do but to go to the Isle of person_1 , and deliver the commission which I give you.
After that you are at liberty to return.
' Perceiving that the caliph insisted upon it , I submitted , and told him that I was willing to obey.
He was very well pleased at it , and ordered me a thousand sequins for the expense of my journey.
I arrived at the Isle of person_1 , where I acquainted the king 's ministers with my commission , and prayed them to get me speedy audience.
They did so , and I was conducted to the palace in an honorable manner , where I saluted the king by prostration , according to custom.
That prince knew me immediately , and testified very great joy to see me.
He sent him also a rich table , which , according to tradition , belonged to the great Solomon.
We hope , when you look upon it , you will find our good intention , and be pleased with it.
Farewell.
' The King of person_1 was highly pleased that the caliph returned his friendship.
A little time after this audience , I solicited leave to depart , and had much difficulty to obtain it.
I obtained it , however , at last , and the king , when he dismissed me , made me a very considerable present.
I embarked immediately to return to person_0 , but had not the good fortune to arrive there as I hoped.
God ordered it otherwise.
Three or four days after my departure , we were attacked by pirates , who easily seized upon our ship.
Some of the crew offered resistance , which cost them their lives.
But as for me and the rest , who were not so imprudent , the pirates saved us on purpose to make slaves of us.
Some days after , not knowing who I was , he asked me if I understood any trade.
I answered that I was no mechanic , but a merchant , and that the pirates who sold me had robbed me of all I had.
' Having spoken thus , he left me victuals , and returned to the town , and I continued upon the tree all night.
When I had told him the news , he gave me a good meal , commended my dexterity , and caressed me highly.
, to trade with.
I continued this game for two months , and killed an elephant every day , getting sometimes upon one tree , and sometimes upon another.
They encompassed the tree where I was with their trunks extended and their eyes all fixed upon me.
At this frightful spectacle I remained immoveable , and was so much frightened that my bow and arrows fell out of my hand.
I confess to you that this furnished me with abundance of reflections.
Pray tell me what befell you , and by what good hap you are still alive.
I declare before Him that I give you your liberty.
I concealed from you what I am now going to tell you.
` The elephants of our forest have every year killed a great many slaves , whom we sent to seek ivory.
Notwithstanding all the cautions we could give them , those crafty animals killed them one time or other.
God has delivered you from their fury , and has bestowed that favor upon you only.
It is a sign that He loves you , and has use for your service in the world.
You have procured me incredible gain.
We could not have ivory formerly but by exposing the lives of our slaves , and now our whole city is enriched by your means.
Do not think I pretend to have rewarded you by giving you your liberty ; I will also give you considerable riches.
I could engage all our city to contribute towards making your fortune , but I will have the glory of doing it myself.
' To this obliging discourse I replied , ` Patron , God preserve you.
' ` Very well , ' said he , ` the monsoon will in a little time bring ships for ivory.
I will send you home then , and give you wherewith to pay your expenses.
' I thanked him again for my liberty , and his good intentions towards me.
The other merchants who traded in it did the same thing , for it could not be long concealed from them.
After I had returned him a thousand thanks for all his favors , I went on board.
We set sail , and as the adventure which procured me this liberty was very extraordinary , I had it continually in my thoughts.
We stopped at some islands to take in fresh provisions.
All these fatigues ended at last , and I came safe to person_0.
I went immediately to wait upon the caliph , and gave him an account of my embassy.
In the forest , high up on the steep shore , hard by the open sea coast , stood a very old oak tree.
Winter is its time for rest , its night after the long day which is called spring , summer , and autumn.
`` Melancholy ! Why do you say that ?"
the Ephemera would then always reply.
`` It 's wonderfully bright , warm , and beautiful all around me , and that makes me rejoice !"
`` But only one day , and then it 's all done !"
`` Done !"
repeated the Ephemera.
`` What 's the meaning of _ done _ ? Are you _ done _ , too ?"
`` No ? then I do n't understand you.
You say you have thousands of my days ; but I have thousands of moments , in which I can be merry and happy.
Does all the beauty of this world cease when you die ?"
`` No ,"
replied the Tree ; `` it will certainly last much longer -- far longer than I can possibly think"
`` Well , then , we have the same time , only that we reckon differently"
`` Poor little Ephemera !"
said the person_0.
`` That was a terribly short life !"
And on every summer day the same dance was repeated , the same question and answer , and the same sleep.
The same thing was repeated through whole generations of ephemera , and all of them felt equally merry and equally happy.
Winter was approaching.
Already the storms were singing their `` good night , good night !"
Here fell a leaf , and there fell a leaf.
Sweet sleep to you , and pleasant dreams !"
The great person_0 had once been small -- indeed , an acorn had been its cradle.
According to human computation , it was now in its fourth century.
It was just at the holy Christmas time , when the tree dreamed its most glorious dream.
The ephemeral insects danced as if all the world were created merely for them to dance and be merry in.
The hunting horn sounded , and the dogs barked.
He saw hostile warriors in colored jerkins and with shining weapons , with spear and halbert , pitching their tents and striking them again.
The watch-fires flamed up anew , and men sang and slept under the branches of the tree.
-LRB- Illustration : THE LOVERS AT THE OLD OAK TREE.
They recalled to his memory well-known gentle eyes , eyes of children , eyes of lovers who had met beneath his boughs.
The crown of the tree waved to and fro , as if he sought something in his silent longing , and he looked down.
Bushes and herbs shot up high , and some tore themselves up bodily by the roots to rise the quicker.
The birch was the quickest of all.
`` But the little blue flower by the water-side , where is that ?"
said the person_0 ; `` and the purple bell-flower and the daisy ?"
for , you see , the old person_0 Tree wanted to have them all about him.
`` We are here -- we are here !"
was shouted and sung in reply.
`` We are here , we are here !"
replied voices still higher in the air.
It seemed as if they had flown on before.
`` Why , that is beautiful , indescribably beautiful !"
exclaimed the old person_0 Tree , rejoicingly.
`` In heaven , in the better land , it can be imagined , and it is possible !"
the reply sounded through the air.
And the old tree , who grew on and on , felt how his roots were tearing themselves free from the ground.
`` That 's right , that 's better than all !"
said the tree.
He fell.
His three hundred and sixty-five years were now as the single day of the Ephemera.
On the morning of the Christmas festival , when the sun rose , the storm had subsided.
`` The tree is down -- the old person_0 Tree , our landmark on the coast !"
said the sailors.
`` It fell in the storm of last night.
Who can replace it ? No one can"
`` Sing , sing aloud , this blessed morn -- It is fulfilled -- and He is born , Oh , joy without compare ! Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !"
We made a long voyage , and touched at several ports , where we drove a considerable trade.
One day , being out in the main ocean , we were attacked by a horrible tempest , which made us lose our course.
As we went on we perceived at a distance a great pile of building , and made towards it.
He had but one eye , and that in the middle of his forehead , where it looked as red as a burning coal.
At the sight of so frightful a giant we lost all our senses , and lay like men dead.
At last we came to ourselves , and saw him sitting in the porch , looking at us.
After having viewed me well , and perceiving me to be so lean that I had nothing but skin and bone , he let me go.
This being done , he returned to his porch , where he lay and fell asleep , snoring louder than thunder.
He slept thus till morning.
Day being come , the giant awoke , got up , went out , and left us in the palace.
Our condition was so very terrible that several of my comrades designed to throw themselves into the sea , rather than die so strange a death.
Having thought of a project for that end , I communicated the same to my comrades , who approved it.
We returned to the palace towards evening , and the giant arrived a little while after.
We were forced to see another of our comrades roasted.
But at last we revenged ourselves on the brutish giant thus.
After he had made an end of his cursed supper , he lay down on his back , and fell asleep.
When we saw this , we made no delay , but got immediately upon our rafts , and rowed off from the shore.
We found excellent fruit there , that gave us great relief , so that we pretty well recovered our strength.
When day appeared he retired , but I dared not to leave my fort until the sun arose.
I called as loud as I could , and taking the linen from my turban , displayed it that they might observe me.
This had the desired effect ; all the crew perceived me , and the captain sent his boat for me.
We entered the port , and came to anchor.
The merchants began to unload their goods , in order to sell or exchange them.
' I thanked him that he gave me an opportunity to employ myself , because I hated to be idle.
But I could not remember him at first , he was so much altered since I saw him.
And as for him , who believed me to be dead , I could not wonder at his not knowing me.
We had the wind in our stern and so fresh a gale that it was not then possible for us to tack about for him.
' ` You believe him then to be dead ? ' said I.
` Certainly , ' answered he.
I fell asleep by a brook , and when I awoke I found all the company gone.
There are your goods , which I always took care to preserve and to make the best of at every port where I touched.
I restore them to you , with the profit I have made on them.
' I took them from him , and at the same time acknowledged how much I owed to him.
From the Isle of Salabat we went to another , where I furnished myself with cloves , cinnamon , and other spices.
As we sailed from that island we saw a tortoise that was twenty cubits in length and breadth.
I saw another which had the shape and color of a camel.
I gave a great deal to the poor , and bought another great estate in addition to what I had already"
The pleasures I took after my third voyage had not charms enough to divert me from another.
I was again prevailed upon by my passion for traffic and curiosity to see new things.
I took the way of Persia , of which I traveled over several provinces , and then arrived at a port , where I embarked.
I ate of it also , but very sparingly.
The fear of death under which I labored turned all my food into poison.
This I took to be a good omen , and went to them without any scruple.
I stayed with them till they had gathered their quantity of pepper , and then sailed with them to the island from whence they came.
They presented me to their king , who was a good prince.
The island was very well peopled , plentiful in everything , and the capital was a place of great trade.
This agreeable retreat was very comfortable to me after my misfortune , and the kindness of this generous prince towards me completed my satisfaction.
I observed one thing which to me appeared very extraordinary.
All the people , the king himself not excepted , rode their horses without bridle or stirrups.
This made me one day take the liberty to ask the king how that came to pass.
His majesty answered , that I talked to him of things which nobody knew the use of in his dominions.
I went immediately to a workman , and gave him a model for making the stock of a saddle.
When that was done , I covered it myself with velvet and leather , and embroidered it with gold.
When I had all things completed , I presented them to the king , and put them upon one of his horses.
His majesty mounted immediately , and was so pleased with them , that he testified his satisfaction by large presents to me.
I also made some for the people of best quality in the city , which gained me great reputation and regard.
I have one thing to demand of thee , which thou must grant.
The ceremonies of marriage being over , I went and dwelt with the lady , and for some time we lived together in perfect harmony.
This is a law which our ancestors established in this island , and always observed inviolably.
The living husband is interred with the dead wife , and the living wife with the dead husband.
Nothing can save me ; every one must submit to this law.
The husband walked at the head of the company , and followed the corpse.
The mountain was pretty long , and reached to the sea.
The ceremony being over , they covered the hole again with the stone , and returned.
I could not forbear speaking my thoughts on this matter to the king.
` Sir , ' said I , ` I can not but wonder at the strange custom in this country of burying the living with the dead.
I have been a great traveller , and seen many countries , but never heard of so cruel a law.
' ` What do you mean , Sinbad ? ' said the king ; ` it is a common law.
I shall be interred with the queen , my wife , if she die first.
But there was no remedy : I must have patience , and submit to the will of God.
You may judge of my sorrow ; to be interred alive seemed to me as deplorable an end as to be devoured by cannibals.
When all was ready for the ceremony , the corpse was put into a coffin , with all her jewels and magnificent apparel.
But thou hast drawn all this upon thyself by thy cursed avarice.
I went groping about , with my nose stopped , for the bread and water that was in my coffin , and took some of it.
I lived for some days upon my bread and water , which being all used up at last I prepared for death.
As I was thinking of death , I heard something walking , and blowing or panting as it walked.
I followed the noise , and the thing seemed to stop sometimes , but always fled and blew as I approached.
Upon this I stopped some time to rest myself , being much fatigued with pursuing this discovery so fast.
Afterwards coming up to the hole I went out at it , and found myself upon the shore of the sea.
I leave you to guess the excess of my joy ; it was such that I could scarce persuade myself of its being real.
After two or three days I perceived a ship that had but just come out of the harbor and passed near the place where I was.
I made a sign with the linen of my turban , and called to them as loud as I could.
They heard me , and sent a boat to bring me on board , when the mariners asked by what misfortune I came thither.
I told them that I had suffered shipwreck two days ago , and made shift to get ashore with the goods they saw.
This island produces lead from its mines , Indian canes , and excellent camphor.
The inhabitants are so barbarous that they still eat human flesh.
After we had finished our commerce in that island we put to sea again , and touched at several other ports.
At last I arrived happily at Bagdad with infinite riches , of which it is needless to trouble you with the detail.
The bird 's work was to fly every day into the forest and bring back wood.
The mouse had to carry water , light the fire , and lay the table , but the sausage had to cook.
He who is too well off is always longing for something new.
One day , therefore , the bird met with another bird , on the way , to whom it related its excellent circumstances and boasted of them.
The other bird , however , called it a poor simpleton for his hard work , but said that the two at home had good times.
And , though the mouse and the sausage also begged most earnestly , the bird would have his way , and said it must be tried.
The bird sadly took up the wood , flew home , and related what he had seen and heard.
They were much troubled , but agreed to do their best and remain together.
When the bird came to carry up the dinner , no cook was there.
There I saw a lean old goat which carried about a hundred cart-loads of fat on his body , and sixty loads of salt.
There I saw two mice consecrating a bishop , and two cats scratching out a bear 's tongue.
Then a snail came running up and killed two furious lions.
There stood a barber and shaved a woman 's beard off ; and two sucking-children bade their mother hold her tongue.
Then a cock crowed , Cock-a - doodle-doo ! The story is all told , -- Cock-a-doodle-doo !"
`` Ah ,"
And while she thus spake , she became quite happy in her mind , and felt just as if that were going to happen.
One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room , and her little daughter went up too , and said , `` Mother , give me an apple"
`` Yes , my child ,"
`` Mother ,"
said the little daughter , `` is brother not to have one too ?"
This made the woman angry , but she said , `` Yes , when he comes out of school"
Then she threw the apple into the chest , and shut it.
and she looked wickedly at him.
`` Mother ,"
said the little boy , `` how dreadful you look ! Yes , give me an apple"
Then it seemed to her as if she were forced to say to him , `` Come with me ,"
and she opened the lid of the chest and said , `` Take out an apple for thyself ,"
Then she was overwhelmed with terror , and thought , `` If I could but make them think that it was not done by me !"
`` Mother ,"
said Marlinchen , `` brother is sitting at the door , and he looks quite white and has an apple in his hand.
I asked him to give me the apple , but he did not answer me , and I was quite frightened"
`` Go back to him ,"
said her mother , `` and if he will not answer thee , give him a box on the ear"
So Marlinchen went to him and said , `` Brother , give me the apple"
But he was silent , and she gave him a box on the ear , on which his head fell down.
and she wept and wept and could not be comforted.
`` Marlinchen ,"
Then the father came home , and sat down to dinner and said , `` But where is my son ?"
And the mother served up a great dish of black-puddings , and Marlinchen wept and could not leave off.
Then the father again said , `` But where is my son ?"
`` Ah ,"
said the mother , `` he has gone across the country to his mother 's great uncle ; he will stay there awhile"
`` And what is he going to do there ? He did not even say good-bye to me"
`` Oh , he wanted to go , and asked me if he might stay six weeks , he is well taken care of there"
`` Ah ,"
said the man , `` I feel so unhappy lest all should not be right.
He ought to have said good-bye to me"
With that he began to eat and said , `` Marlinchen , why art thou crying ? Thy brother will certainly come back"
Then he said , `` Ah , wife , how delicious this food is , give me some more"
And the more he ate the more he wanted to have , and he said , `` Give me some more , you shall have none of it.
It seems to me as if it were all mine"
And he ate and ate and threw all the bones under the table , until he had finished the whole.
Marlinchen , however , was as gay and happy as if her brother were still alive.
And she went merrily into the house , and sat down to dinner and ate.
He stood up , but as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers.
Then he went right on and stood still , and said to the bird , `` Bird ,"
said he then , `` how beautifully thou canst sing ! Sing me that piece again"
`` No ,"
said the bird , `` I 'll not sing it twice for nothing ! Give me the golden chain , and then I will sing it again for thee"
`` There ,"
said the goldsmith , `` there is the golden chain for thee , now sing me that song again"
`` Bird ,"
said he , `` how beautifully thou canst sing !"
`` Bird ,"
said the shoemaker , `` now sing me that song again"
`` Nay ,"
said the bird , `` I do not sing twice for nothing ; thou must give me something"
`` Wife ,"
said the man , `` go to the garret , upon the top shelf there stands a pair of red shoes , bring them down"
Then the wife went and brought the shoes.
`` There , bird ,"
said the man , `` now sing me that piece again"
And when he had sung the whole he flew away.
Then the bird went and sat on a lime-tree which stood in front of the mill , and sang , `` My mother she killed me ,"
Then one of them stopped working , `` My father he ate me"
Then two more stopped working and listened to that , `` My sister , little Marlinchen ,"
Then four more stopped , `` Gathered together all my bones , Tied them in a silken handkerchief ,"
Now eight only were hewing , `` Laid them beneath"
Now only five , `` The juniper-tree ,"
And now only one , `` Kywitt , kywitt , what a beautiful bird am I !"
Then the last stopped also , and heard the last words.
`` Bird ,"
said he , `` how beautifully thou singest ! Let me , too , hear that.
Sing that once more for me"
`` Nay ,"
said the bird , `` I will not sing twice for nothing.
Give me the millstone , and then I will sing it again"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` if it belonged to me only , thou shouldst have it"
`` Yes ,"
said the others , `` if he sings again he shall have it"
Then the bird came down , and the twenty millers all set to work with a beam and raised the stone up.
`` Nay ,"
said the mother , `` I feel so uneasy , just as if a heavy storm were coming"
`` Nay ,"
said the woman , `` I feel so anxious , my teeth chatter , and I seem to have fire in my veins"
Then the bird sat on the juniper tree , and sang , `` My mother she killed me ,"
`` Ah , mother ,"
`` My sister , little Marlinchen ,"
`` Oh , do n't go ,"
said the woman , `` I feel as if the whole house were shaking and on fire"
But the woman was terrified , and fell down on the floor in the room , and her cap fell off her head.
Then sang the bird once more , `` My mother she killed me"
`` Would that I were a thousand feet beneath the earth so as not to hear that !"
`` My father he ate me ,"
Then the woman fell down again as if dead.
`` My sister , little Marlinchen ,"
`` Ah ,"
said Marlinchen , `` I too will go out and see if the bird will give me anything ,"
and she went out.
`` Gathered together all my bones , Tied them in a silken handkerchief ,"
Then he threw down the shoes to her.
`` Laid them beneath the juniper-tree , Kywitt , kywitt , what a beautiful bird am I !"
Then she was light-hearted and joyous , and she put on the new red shoes , and danced and leaped into the house.
`` Ah ,"
`` Well ,"
And as she went out at the door , crash ! the bird threw down the millstone on her head , and she was entirely crushed by it.
In the olden time there was a king , who had behind his palace a beautiful pleasure-garden in which there was a tree that bore golden apples.
When the apples were getting ripe they were counted , but on the very next morning one was missing.
This was told to the King , and he ordered that a watch should be kept every night beneath the tree.
The youth lay down beneath the tree , but kept awake , and did not let sleep master him.
When it struck twelve , something rustled through the air , and in the moonlight he saw a bird coming whose feathers were all shining with gold.
The bird alighted on the tree , and had just plucked off an apple , when the youth shot an arrow at him.
The bird flew off , but the arrow had struck his plumage , and one of his golden feathers fell down.
The youth picked it up , and the next morning took it to the King and told him what he had seen in the night.
The King called his council together , and everyone declared that a feather like this was worth more than the whole kingdom.
`` If the feather is so precious ,"
declared the King , `` one alone will not do for me ; I must and will have the whole bird !"
The eldest son set out ; he trusted to his cleverness , and thought that he would easily find the Golden Bird.
The Fox cried , `` Do not shoot me ! and in return I will give you some good counsel.
`` How can such a silly beast give wise advice ?"
thought the King 's son , and he pulled the trigger.
But he missed the Fox , who stretched out his tail and ran quickly into the wood.
`` I should be a fool , indeed ,"
he thought , `` if I were to go into the shabby tavern , and pass by the good one"
So he went into the cheerful one , lived there in riot and revel , and forgot the bird and his father , and all good counsels.
The Fox met him as he had met the eldest , and gave him the good advice of which he took no heed.
He could not resist , but went inside and lived only for pleasure.
`` It is of no use ,"
But at last , as he had no peace , he let him go.
Again the Fox was sitting outside the wood , and begged for his life , and offered his good advice.
The youth was good-natured , and said , `` Be easy , little Fox , I will do you no harm"
`` You shall not repent it ,"
answered the Fox ; `` and that you may get on more quickly , get up behind on my tail"
And scarcely had he seated himself when the Fox began to run , and away he went over stock and stone till his hair whistled in the wind.
When he came to the castle he found everything as the Fox had said.
`` But ,"
thought he , `` it would be absurd if I were to leave the beautiful bird in the common and ugly cage ,"
so he opened the door , laid hold of it , and put it into the golden cage.
But at the same moment the bird uttered a shrill cry.
The soldiers awoke , rushed in , and took him off to prison.
The next morning he was taken before a court of justice , and as he confessed everything , was sentenced to death.
`` Look you ,"
said the Fox , `` this has happened because you did not give heed to me.
However , be of good courage.
I will give you my help , and tell you how to get to the Golden Horse.
You must go straight on , and you will come to a castle , where in the stable stands the horse.
But scarcely had the golden saddle touched the horse than he began to neigh loudly.
The grooms awoke , seized the youth , and threw him into prison.
With a heavy heart the youth set out ; yet luckily for him he soon found the trusty Fox.
`` I ought only to leave you to your ill-luck ,"
said the Fox , `` but I pity you , and will help you once more out of your trouble.
When he reached the Golden Castle it was just as the Fox had said.
He waited until midnight , when everything lay in deep sleep , and the beautiful princess was going to the bathing-house.
Then he sprang out and gave her a kiss.
At first he withstood her prayer , but when she wept more and more , and fell at his feet , he at last gave in.
If you do that you shall have my daughter as your reward"
The next morning when he awoke and looked out of the window the hill had gone.
So the two set forth together , and it was not long before the trusty Fox came up with them.
`` You have certainly got what is best ,"
said he , `` but the Golden Horse also belongs to the maiden of the Golden Castle"
`` How shall I get it ?"
asked the youth.
`` That I will tell you ,"
answered the Fox ; `` first take the beautiful maiden to the King who sent you to the Golden Castle.
There will be unheard-of rejoicing ; they will gladly give you the Golden Horse , and will bring it out to you.
Mount it as soon as possible , and offer your hand to all in farewell ; last of all to the beautiful maiden.
All was carried out successfully , and the King 's son carried off the beautiful princess on the Golden Horse.
The Fox did not remain behind , and he said to the youth , `` Now I will help you to get the Golden Bird.
As soon as you have the cage in your hand gallop back to us , and take the maiden away again"
`` What do you require for it ?"
asked the youth.
`` When you get into the wood yonder , shoot me dead , and chop off my head and feet"
`` That would be fine gratitude ,"
said the King 's son.
`` I can not possibly do that for you"
Be careful about two things.
Buy no gallows ' - flesh , and do not sit at the edge of any well"
And then he ran into the wood.
He rode on with the beautiful maiden , and his road took him again through the village in which his two brothers had remained.
He inquired whether they could not be set free.
`` If you will pay for them ,"
answered the people ; `` but why should you waste your money on wicked men , and buy them free"
He did not think twice about it , but paid for them , and when they were set free they all went on their way together.
He agreed , and whilst they were talking he forgot himself , and sat down upon the edge of the well without thinking of any evil.
`` Here we bring you not only the Golden Bird ,"
said they ; `` we have won the Golden Horse also , and the maiden from the Golden Castle"
Then was there great joy ; but the Horse would not eat , the Bird would not sing , and the maiden sat and wept.
But the youngest brother was not dead.
By good fortune the well was dry , and he fell upon soft moss without being hurt , but he could not get out again.
`` But yet I can not give it up so ,"
he said ; `` I will help you up again into daylight"
He bade him grasp his tail and keep tight hold of it ; and then he pulled him up.
`` You are not out of all danger yet ,"
said the Fox.
`` Your brothers were not sure of your death , and have surrounded the wood with watchers , who are to kill you if you let yourself be seen"
But a poor man was sitting upon the road , with whom the youth changed clothes , and in this way he got to the King 's palace.
No one knew him , but the Bird began to sing , the Horse began to eat , and the beautiful maiden left off weeping.
The King , astonished , asked , `` What does this mean ?"
She told him all that had happened , although the other brothers had threatened her with death if she were to betray anything.
The wicked brothers were seized and put to death , but he was married to the beautiful maiden and declared heir to the King.
and again he asked him with tears to shoot him dead and chop off his head and feet.
And now nothing more was wanting to their happiness as long as they lived"
What good will it do you to kill me ? I should not be good to eat , put me in the water again , and let me go"
`` Come ,"
said the Fisherman , `` there is no need for so many words about it -- a fish that can talk I should certainly let go , anyhow ,"
with that he put him back again into the clear water , and the person_0 went to the bottom , leaving a long streak of blood behind him.
Then the Fisherman got up and went home to his wife in the hovel.
`` Husband ,"
said the woman , `` have you caught nothing to-day ?"
`` No ,"
said the man , `` I did catch a person_0 , who said he was an enchanted prince , so I let him go again"
`` Did you not wish for anything first ?"
said the woman.
`` No ,"
said the man ; `` what should I wish for ?"
`` Ah ,"
Go back and call him.
Tell him we want to have a small cottage , he will certainly give us that"
`` Ah ,"
said the man , `` why should I go there again ?"
`` Why ,"
said the woman , `` you did catch him , and you let him go again ; he is sure to do it.
Go at once"
The man still did not quite like to go , but did not like to oppose his wife , and went to the sea.
Then the person_0 came swimming to him and said , `` Well what does she want , then ?"
`` Ah ,"
said the man , `` I did catch you , and my wife says I really ought to have wished for something.
She does not like to live in a wretched hovel any longer.
She would like to have a cottage"
`` Go , then ,"
said the person_0 , `` she has it already"
Then she took him by the hand and said to him , `` Just come inside , look , now is n't this a great deal better ?"
And behind the cottage there was a small yard , with hens and ducks , and a little garden with flowers and fruit.
`` Look ,"
said the wife , `` is not that nice !"
`` Yes ,"
said the husband , `` and so we must always think it , -- now we will live quite contented"
`` We will think about that ,"
said the wife.
With that they ate something and went to bed.
I should like to live in a great stone castle ; go to the person_0 , and tell him to give us a castle"
`` Ah , wife ,"
said the man , `` the cottage is quite good enough ; why should we live in a castle ?"
`` What !"
said the woman ; `` just go there , the person_0 can always do that"
`` No , wife ,"
said the man , `` the person_0 has just given us the cottage , I do not like to go back so soon , it might make him angry"
`` Go ,"
said the woman , `` he can do it quite easily , and will be glad to do it ; just you go to him"
The man 's heart grew heavy , and he would not go.
He said to himself , `` It is not right ,"
and yet he went.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said the man , half scared , `` she wants to live in a great stone castle"
`` Go to it , then , she is standing before the door ,"
said the person_0.
`` Come ,"
said the woman , `` is n't that beautiful ?"
`` Yes , indeed ,"
said the man , `` now let it be ; and we will live in this beautiful castle and be content"
`` We will consider about that ,"
said the woman , `` and sleep upon it ;"
thereupon they went to bed.
Next morning the wife awoke first , and it was just daybreak , and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her.
Look you , could n't we be the King over all that land ? Go to the person_0 , we will be the King"
`` Ah , wife ,"
said the man , `` why should we be King ? I do not want to be King"
`` Well ,"
said the wife , `` if you wo n't be King , I will ; go to the person_0 , for I will be King"
`` Ah , wife ,"
said the man , `` why do you want to be King ? I do not like to say that to him"
`` Why not ?"
said the woman ; `` go to him this instant ; I must be King !"
So the man went , and was quite unhappy because his wife wished to be King.
`` It is not right ; it is not right ,"
thought he.
He did not wish to go , but yet he went.
And when he came to the sea , it was quite dark-grey , and the water heaved up from below , and smelt putrid.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said the man , `` she wants to be King"
`` Go to her ; she is King already"
And when he went inside the house , everything was of real marble and gold , with velvet covers and great golden tassels.
Then he went and stood before her , and said , `` Ah , wife , and now you are King"
`` Yes ,"
said the woman , `` now I am King"
`` Nay , husband ,"
`` Alas , wife , why do you wish to be Emperor ?"
`` Husband ,"
said she , `` go to the person_0.
I will be Emperor"
`` Alas , wife ,"
said the man , `` he can not make you Emperor ; I may not say that to the fish.
There is only one Emperor in the land.
An Emperor the person_0 can not make you ! I assure you he can not"
`` What !"
I will be Emperor ; go instantly"
So he was forced to go.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas , person_0 ,"
said he , `` my wife wants to be Emperor"
`` Go to her ,"
said the person_0 ; `` she is Emperor already"
Then they opened the doors to him , which were of pure gold.
And before it stood a number of princes and dukes.
Then the man went and stood among them , and said , `` Wife , are you Emperor now ?"
`` Yes ,"
said she , `` now I am Emperor"
`` Husband ,"
said she , `` why are you standing there ? Now , I am Emperor , but I will be Pope too ; go to the person_0"
`` Alas , wife ,"
said the man , `` what will you not wish for ? You can not be Pope.
There is but one in Christendom.
He can not make you Pope"
`` Husband ,"
said she , `` I will be Pope ; go immediately , I must be Pope this very day"
`` No , wife ,"
`` Husband ,"
said she , `` what nonsense ! If he can make an emperor he can make a pope.
Go to him directly.
I am Emperor , and you are nothing but my husband ; will you go at once ?"
Then he was afraid and went ; but he was quite faint , and shivered and shook , and his knees and legs trembled.
And in the distance he saw ships which were firing guns in their sore need , pitching and tossing on the waves.
For my wife , good Ilsabil , Wills not as I 'd have her will.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said the man , `` she wants to be Pope"
`` Go to her then ,"
said the person_0 ; `` she is Pope already"
So he went , and when he got there , he saw what seemed to be a large church surrounded by palaces.
He pushed his way through the crowd.
`` Wife ,"
said the man , and looked attentively at her , `` are you now Pope ?"
`` Yes ,"
said she , `` I am Pope"
So he stood and looked at her , and it was just as if he was looking at the bright sun.
But she looked as stiff as a post , and did not move or show any signs of life.
Then said he , `` Wife , now that you are Pope , be satisfied , you can not become anything greater now"
`` I will consider about that ,"
said the woman.
At length the sun began to rise , and when the woman saw the red of dawn , she sat up in bed and looked at it.
`` Husband ,"
The man was still half asleep , but he was so horrified that he fell out of bed.
He thought he must have heard amiss , and rubbed his eyes , and said , `` Alas , wife , what are you saying ?"
`` Husband ,"
I shall not know what it is to have another happy hour , unless I can make them rise myself"
Then she looked at him so terribly that a shudder ran over him , and said , `` Go at once ; I wish to be like unto God"
`` Alas , wife ,"
Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said he , `` she wants to be like unto God"
`` Go to her , and you will find her back again in the dirty hovel"
And there they are living still at this very time"
There were once on a time a king and a queen who lived happily together and had twelve children , but they were all boys.
`` Dearest child ,"
she answered , `` I may not tell thee"
But he let her have no rest until she went and unlocked the room , and showed him the twelve coffins ready filled with shavings.
After she had blessed her sons therefore , they went forth into the forest.
They each kept watch in turn , and sat on the highest oak and looked towards the tower.
When eleven days had passed and the turn came to person_0 , he saw that a flag was being raised.
It was , however , not the white , but the blood-red flag which announced that they were all to die.
They lived together ten years in the little hut , and the time did not appear long to them.
Then the Queen answered with a heavy heart , `` Dear child , these belong to thy twelve brothers"
Said the maiden , `` Where are my twelve brothers , I have never yet heard of them ?"
She replied , `` God knows where they are , they are wandering about the world"
Then she took the maiden and opened the chamber for her , and showed her the twelve coffins with the shavings , and pillows for the head.
`` These coffins ,"
said she , `` were destined for thy brothers , but they went away secretly before thou wert born ,"
and she related to her how everything had happened ; then said the maiden , `` Dear mother , weep not , I will go and seek my brothers"
So she took the twelve shirts and went forth , and straight into the great forest.
She walked the whole day , and in the evening she came to the bewitched hut.
Then she entered it and found a young boy , who asked , `` From whence comest thou , and whither art thou bound ?"
and was astonished that she was so beautiful , and wore royal garments , and had a star on her forehead.
She likewise showed him the twelve shirts which belonged to them.
Then person_0 saw that she was his sister , and said , `` I am person_0 , thy youngest brother"
And she began to weep for joy , and person_0 wept also , and they kissed and embraced each other with the greatest love.
But after this he said , `` Dear sister , there is still one difficulty.
We have agreed that every maiden whom we meet shall die , because we have been obliged to leave our kingdom on account of a girl"
Then said she , `` I will willingly die , if by so doing I can deliver my twelve brothers"
`` No ,"
She did so , and when it was night the others came from hunting , and their dinner was ready.
And as they were sitting at table , and eating , they asked , `` What news is there ?"
Said person_0 , `` Do n't you know anything ?"
`` No ,"
they answered.
He continued , `` You have been in the forest and I have stayed at home , and yet I know more than you do"
`` Tell us then ,"
they cried.
He answered , `` But promise me that the first maiden who meets us shall not be killed"
`` Yes ,"
they all cried , `` she shall have mercy , only do tell us"
Then said he , `` Our sister is here ,"
Then they were all rejoiced , and fell on her neck , and kissed and loved her with all their hearts.
Now she stayed at home with person_0 and helped him with the work.
There was , however , a little garden belonging to the bewitched house wherein stood twelve lily flowers , which are likewise called students.
She wished to give her brothers pleasure , and plucked the twelve flowers , and thought she would present each brother with one while at dinner.
The maiden said , weeping , `` Is there no way of delivering them ?"
`` No ,"
Then said the maiden in her heart , `` I know with certainty that I shall set my brothers free ,"
and went and sought a high tree and seated herself in it and span , and neither spoke nor laughed.
She made no answer , but nodded a little with her head.
So he climbed up the tree himself , carried her down , placed her on his horse , and bore her home.
Then the wedding was solemnized with great magnificence and rejoicing , but the bride neither spoke nor smiled.
They tore the fire asunder , extinguished the flames , set their dear sister free , and kissed and embraced her.
And now as she dared to open her mouth and speak , she told the King why she had been dumb , and had never laughed.
The King rejoiced when he heard that she was innocent , and they all lived in great unity until their death.
The wicked step-mother was taken before the judge , and put into a barrel filled with boiling oil and venomous snakes , and died an evil death"
`` I shall win the princess !"
So cried both of them.
Therefore their old papa gave to each a handsome horse.
Then they rubbed the corners of their mouths with fish-oil , so that they might become very smooth and glib.
All the servants stood below in the courtyard , and looked on while they mounted their horses ; and just by chance the third son came up.
`` Hallo !"
said Jack the Dullard , `` where are you going ? I declare you have put on your Sunday clothes !"
`` We 're going to the king 's court , as suitors to the king 's daughter.
Do n't you know the announcement that has been made all through the country ?"
And they told him all about it.
`` My word ! I 'll be in it too !"
cried Jack the Dullard ; and his two brothers burst out laughing at him , and rode away.
`` Father dear ,"
said Jack , `` I must have a horse too.
`` Do n't talk nonsense ,"
replied the old gentleman.
`` You shall have no horse from me.
You do n't know how to speak -- you ca n't arrange your words.
Your brothers are very different fellows from you"
`` Well ,"
And so said , so done.
He mounted the billy-goat , pressed his heels into its sides , and gallopped down the high street like a hurricane.
`` Hei , houp ! that was a ride ! Here I come !"
shouted Jack the Dullard , and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide.
But his brothers rode slowly on in advance of him.
`` Hallo !"
shouted Jack the Dullard.
`` Here am I ! Look what I have found on the high-road"
And he showed them what it was , and it was a dead crow.
`` Dullard !"
exclaimed the brothers , `` what are you going to do with that ?"
`` With the crow ? why , I am going to give it to the princess"
`` Yes , do so ,"
said they ; and they laughed , and rode on.
`` Hallo , here I am again ! Just see what I have found now : you do n't find that on the high-road every day !"
And the brothers turned round to see what he could have found now.
`` Dullard !"
`` Most certainly I shall ,"
and there was Jack the Dullard again.
`` It is getting better and better ,"
he cried.
`` Hurrah ! it is quite famous"
`` Why , what have you found this time ?"
inquired the brothers.
`` Oh ,"
said Jack the Dullard , `` I can hardly tell you.
How glad the princess will be !"
`` Bah !"
said the brothers ; `` that is nothing but clay out of the ditch"
`` Yes , certainly it is ,"
said Jack the Dullard ; `` and clay of the finest sort.
See , it is so wet , it runs through one 's fingers"
And he filled his pocket with the clay.
But his brothers gallopped on till the sparks flew , and consequently they arrived a full hour earlier at the town-gate than could Jack.
Then the princess would say , `` He is of no use ! away with him out of the hall !"
It was a terrible ordeal , and they had moreover made such a fire in the stove , that the room seemed quite red hot.
`` It is dreadfully hot here !"
observed the first brother.
`` Yes ,"
replied the princess , `` my father is going to roast young pullets to-day"
`` Baa !"
there he stood like a baa-lamb.
He had not been prepared for a speech of this kind ; and had not a word to say , though he intended to say something witty.
`` Baa !"
`` He is of no use !"
said the princess.
`` Away with him"
And he was obliged to go accordingly.
And now the second brother came in.
`` It is terribly warm here !"
he observed.
`` Yes , we 're roasting pullets to-day ,"
replied the princess.
`` What -- what were you -- were you pleased to ob --"
stammered he -- and all the clerks wrote down , `` pleased to ob --"
`` He is of no use !"
said the princess.
`` Away with him !"
Now came the turn of Jack the Dullard.
He rode into the hall on his goat.
`` Well , it 's most abominably hot here"
`` Yes , because I 'm roasting young pullets ,"
replied the princess.
`` Ah , that 's lucky !"
exclaimed Jack the Dullard , `` for I suppose you 'll let me roast my crow at the same time ?"
`` With the greatest pleasure ,"
said the princess.
`` But have you anything you can roast it in ? for I have neither pot nor pan"
`` Certainly I have !"
said Jack.
`` Here 's a cooking utensil with a tin handle"
And he brought out the old wooden shoe , and put the crow into it.
`` Well , that _ is _ a famous dish !"
said the princess.
`` But what shall we do for sauce ?"
`` Oh , I have that in my pocket ,"
said Jack : `` I have so much of it , that I can afford to throw some away ;"
and he poured some of the clay out of his pocket.
`` I like that !"
said the princess.
`` You can give an answer , and you have something to say for yourself , and so you shall be my husband.
`` Oh , those are the gentlemen , are they ?"
said Jack ; `` then I will give the best I have to the head clerk"
And he turned out his pockets , and flung the wet clay full in the head clerk 's face.
`` That was very cleverly done ,"
observed the princess.
`` I could not have done that ; but I shall learn in time"
And accordingly Jack the Dullard was made a king , and received a crown and a wife , and sat upon a throne.
`` It 's so wonderfully cold that my whole body crackles !"
said the person_0.
`` This is a kind of wind that can blow life into one ; and how the gleaming one up yonder is staring at me"
He meant the sun , which was just about to set.
`` It shall not make _ me _ wink -- I shall manage to keep the pieces"
He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head instead of eyes.
His mouth was made of an old rake , and consequently was furnished with teeth.
He had been born amid the joyous shouts of the boys , and welcomed by the sound of sledge bells and the slashing of whips.
The sun went down , and the full moon rose , round , large , clear , and beautiful in the blue air.
`` There it comes again from the other side ,"
said the person_0.
He intended to say the sun is showing himself again.
`` Ah ! I have cured him of staring.
Now let him hang up there and shine , that I may see myself.
If I only knew how I could manage to move from this place , I should like so much to move.
`` Away ! away !"
barked the old Yard Dog.
He was quite hoarse , and could not pronounce the genuine `` bow , wow"
He had got the hoarseness from the time when he was an indoor dog , and lay by the fire.
`` The sun will teach you to run ! I saw that last winter , in your predecessor , and before that in _ his _ predecessor.
Away ! away ! -- and away they all go"
`` I do n't understand you , comrade ,"
said the person_0.
`` That thing up yonder is to teach me to run ?"
He meant the moon.
`` Yes , it was running itself , when I saw it a little while ago , and now it comes creeping from the other side"
`` You know nothing at all ,"
retorted the Yard Dog.
`` But then you 've only just been patched up.
What you see yonder is the moon , and the one that went before was the sun.
It will come again to-morrow , and will teach you to run down into the ditch by the wall.
`` I do n't understand him ,"
said the person_0 ; `` but I have a feeling that he 's talking about something disagreeable.
The one who stared so just now , and whom he called the sun , is not my friend.
I can feel that too"
`` Away ! away !"
barked the Yard Dog ; and he turned round three times , and then crept into his kennel to sleep.
The weather really changed.
Towards morning , a thick damp fog lay over the whole region ; later there came a wind , an icy wind.
The many delicate ramifications , concealed in summer by the wreath of leaves , now made their appearance : it seemed like a lace-work , gleaming white.
A snowy radiance sprang from every twig.
The birch waved in the wind -- it had life , like the rest of the trees in summer.
It was wonderfully beautiful.
`` That is wonderfully beautiful ,"
said a young girl , who came with a young man into the garden.
They both stood still near the person_0 , and contemplated the glittering trees.
`` Summer can not show a more beautiful sight ,"
said she ; and her eyes sparkled.
`` And we ca n't have such a fellow as this in summer-time ,"
replied the young man , and he pointed to the person_0.
`` He is capital"
`` Who were those two ?"
the person_0 inquired of the Yard Dog.
`` You 've been longer in the yard than I.
Do you know them ?"
`` Of course I know them ,"
replied the Yard Dog.
`` She has stroked me , and he has thrown me a meat bone.
I do n't bite those two"
`` But what are they ?"
asked the person_0.
`` Lovers !"
replied the Yard Dog.
`` They will go to live in the same kennel , and gnaw at the same bone.
Away ! away !"
-LRB- Illustration : THE SNOW MAN AND THE YARD DOG.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Are they the same kind of beings as you and I ?"
asked the person_0.
`` Why , they belong to the master ,"
retorted the Yard Dog.
`` People certainly know very little who were only born yesterday.
I can see that in you.
I have age , and information.
Away ! away !"
`` The cold is charming ,"
said the person_0.
`` Tell me , tell me.
-- But you must not clank with your chain , for it jars within me when you do that"
`` Away ! away !"
barked the Yard Dog.
They used to kiss my nose , and wipe my paws with an embroidered handkerchief.
I was called ` Ami -- dear Ami -- sweet Ami.
' But afterwards I grew too big for them , and they gave me away to the housekeeper.
So I came to live in the basement storey.
I received just as good food as ever , and even better.
I had my own cushion , and there was a stove , the finest thing in the world at this season.
I went under the stove , and could lie down quite beneath it.
Ah ! I still dream of that stove.
Away ! away !"
`` Does a stove look so beautiful ?"
asked the person_0.
`` Is it at all like me ?"
`` It 's just the reverse of you.
It 's as black as a crow , and has a long neck and a brazen drum.
It eats firewood , so that the fire spurts out of its mouth.
One must keep at its side , or under it , and there one is very comfortable.
You can see it through the window from where you stand"
And the person_0 looked and saw a bright polished thing with a brazen drum , and the fire gleamed from the lower part of it.
`` And why did you leave her ?"
asked the person_0 , for it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex.
`` How could you quit such a comfortable place ?"
`` I was obliged ,"
replied the Yard Dog.
`` They turned me out of doors , and chained me up here.
I had bitten the youngest young master in the leg , because he kicked away the bone I was gnawing.
` Bone for bone , ' I thought.
They took that very much amiss , and from that time I have been fastened to a chain and have lost my voice.
Do n't you hear how hoarse I am ? Away ! away ! I ca n't talk any more like other dogs.
Away ! away ! that was the end of the affair"
But the person_0 was no longer listening to him.
`` What a strange crackling within me !"
he said.
`` Shall I ever get in there ? It is an innocent wish , and our innocent wishes are certain to be fulfilled.
I must go in there and lean against her , even if I have to break through the window"
`` You will never get in there ,"
said the Yard Dog ; `` and if you approach the stove you 'll melt away -- away !"
`` I am as good as gone ,"
replied the person_0.
`` I think I am breaking up"
The whole day the person_0 stood looking in through the window.
When the room-door opened , the flame started out of his mouth ; this was a habit the stove had.
The flame fell distinctly on the white face of the person_0 , and gleamed red upon his bosom.
`` I can endure it no longer ,"
said he ; `` how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue !"
In the morning the window-panes of the basement lodging were covered with ice.
They bore the most beautiful ice-flowers that any snow man could desire ; but they concealed the stove.
The window-panes would not thaw ; he could not see the stove , which he pictured to himself as a lovely female being.
It crackled and whistled in him and around him ; it was just the kind of frosty weather a snow man must thoroughly enjoy.
said the Yard Dog.
`` I have suffered from it myself , but I got over it.
Away ! away !"
he barked ; and he added , `` the weather is going to change"
And the weather did change ; it began to thaw.
The warmth increased , and the person_0 decreased.
He said nothing , and made no complaint -- and that 's an infallible sign.
One morning he broke down.
And behold , where he had stood , something like a broomstick remained sticking up out of the ground.
It was the pole round which the boys had built him up.
`` Ah ! now I can understand why he had such an intense longing ,"
said the Yard Dog.
`` Why , there 's a shovel for cleaning out the stove fastened to the pole.
The person_0 had a stove-rake in his body , and that 's what moved within him.
Now he has got over that too.
Away ! away !"
And soon they had got over the winter.
`` Away ! away !"
And with the cuckoo I 'll sing too , Come thou , dear sun , come out , cuckoo !"
And nobody thought any more of the person_0"
There was mourning in the house , sorrow in every heart.
The youngest child , a boy four years old , the joy and hope of his parents , had died.
It was a heavy trial.
The sisters mourned as young hearts can , and were especially moved at the sight of their parents ' sorrow.
The father was bowed down , and the mother completely struck down by the great grief.
She could not realize that the child was dead , and that it must be laid in a coffin and sleep in the ground.
He has heartless servants here on earth , who do according to their own liking , and hear not the prayers of a mother"
But these thoughts gave her no stay , nothing on which she could take hold ; and she sank into the fathomless abyss of despair.
In her heaviest hours she could weep no more , and she thought not of the young daughters who were still left to her.
The tears of her husband fell upon her forehead , but she did not look at him.
The day of the funeral came.
When she awoke , and wanted to see her child , the husband said , `` We have nailed down the coffin.
It was necessary to do so"
`` When person_0 is hard towards me , how should men be better ?"
she said , with sobs and groans.
The coffin was carried to the grave.
The disconsolate mother sat with her young daughters.
She looked at her daughters , and yet did not see them , for her thoughts were no longer busy at the domestic hearth.
She gave herself up to her grief , and grief tossed her to and fro as the sea tosses a ship without compass or rudder.
So the day of the funeral passed away , and similar days followed , of dark , wearying pain.
They persuaded her to seek her couch , and she lay still there , like one who slept.
One night her husband was listening , as he often did , to her breathing , and fully believed that she had now found rest and relief.
She stepped through the garden of the house , and over the fields , where a path led to the churchyard.
No one saw her on her walk -- she had seen nobody , for her eyes were fixed upon the one goal of her journey.
It was a lovely starlight night ; the air was still mild ; it was in the beginning of September.
She entered the churchyard , and stood by the little grave , which looked like a great nosegay of fragrant flowers.
`` Thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child ,"
said a voice quite close to her , a voice that sounded so clear and deep , it went straight to her heart.
She looked up ; and near her stood a man wrapped in a black cloak , with a hood drawn closely down over his face.
But she glanced keenly up , and saw his face under his hood.
It was stern , but yet awakened confidence , and his eyes beamed with the radiance of youth.
`` Down to my child !"
she repeated ; and a despairing supplication spoke out of her words.
`` Darest thou follow me ?"
asked the form.
`` I am Death"
And she bowed her head in acquiescence.
A corner of the cloak was removed , and she stood in a great hall which spread wide and pleasantly around.
It was twilight.
But in a moment her child appeared , and was pressed to her heart , smiling at her in greater beauty than he had ever possessed.
She uttered a cry , but it was inaudible.
`` My sweet darling mother ,"
she heard her child say.
It was the well-known , much-loved voice , and kiss followed kiss in boundless felicity ; and the child pointed to the dark curtain.
`` It is not so beautiful on earth.
Do you see , mother -- do you see them all ? Oh , that is happiness !"
-LRB- Illustration : THE MOTHER AT THE GRAVE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa But the mother saw nothing which the child pointed out -- nothing but the dark night.
She looked with earthly eyes , and could not see as the child saw , which person_0 had called to Himself.
She could hear the sounds of the music , but she heard not the word -- _ the Word _ in which she was to believe.
`` Now I can fly , mother -- I can fly with all the other happy children into the presence of the Almighty.
May I not fly ? And you will come to me soon -- will you not , dear mother ?"
`` Oh , stay ! stay !"
entreated the mother.
`` Only one moment more -- only once more I should wish to look at thee , and kiss thee , and press thee in my arms"
And she kissed and fondled the child.
Then her name was called from above -- called in a plaintive voice.
What might this mean ? `` Hearest thou ?"
asked the child.
`` It is my father who calls thee"
And in a few moments deep sighs were heard , as of weeping children.
`` They are my sisters ,"
said the child.
`` Mother , you surely have not forgotten them ?"
And then she remembered those she had left behind.
A great terror came upon her.
She looked out into the night , and above her dim forms were flitting past.
She seemed to recognize a few more of these.
They floated through the Hall of Death towards the dark curtain , and there they vanished.
said the child.
`` Mother , now the sun is going to rise"
And an overpowering light streamed in upon her.
The child had vanished , and she was borne upwards.
And when she had spoken those words , it was as if her heart were lightened.
Then the sun burst forth , and over her head a little bird sang out , and the church bells sounded for early service.
Everything was holy around her , and her heart was chastened.
She acknowledged the goodness of person_0 , she acknowledged the duties she had to perform , and eagerly she went home.
And she was gentle and strong , as a wife can be ; and from her came the consoling words , `` person_0 's will is always the best"
Then her husband asked her , `` From whence hast thou all at once derived this strength -- this feeling of consolation ?"
And she kissed him , and kissed her children , and said , `` They came from person_0 , through the child in the grave"
THE key , which opes the chest of hoarded gold.
Unlocks the heart that favors would withhold.
As person_0 was a judge of high degree , No one so well embassador could be.
Though great the honor , he should leave his dove , Which would be painful to connubial love.
Long embassies and journeys far from home Oft cuckoldom around induce to roam.
` Gainst those declare at once ; nor lend an ear To flattery , their cunning sister-peer.
WHY would ` st thou , friend , said Atis , these destroy ? God meant that all should freely life enjoy.
Grudge no expense , be gen ` rous , and be bold , Your handfuls scatter , lavish be of gold.
` Twere better come herself and take a view : The things were wond ` rous that the dog could do.
THE dame at any price the dog would buy , In case the master should the boon deny.
Bur , said the wife , my husband made me vow.
This favor , whether you accord or not , ` Twill not a whit be less nor more a blot.
THE judge , both maid and servants , questioned much ; But not a hint he got , their care was such.
Revenge induced her ev ` ry thing to tell , Though she were implicated with the belle.
-RRB- As yet the lady in the country stayed ; Her husband to and fro ' his visits paid.
-- A jade ! she horns has planted on my brow : Her death shall be the consequence I vow.
TO seek fair Argia instantly he went ; She , by her dog , was warned of his intent.
THE husband stood aghast ! -- admired the place , Not built for man , e ` en gods ` twould not disgrace.
person_0 My lord ? Negro You wo n't engage ? Just as you will : -- ` tis all the same you 'll find.
person_0 My lord !.
THUS metamorphosed to a pretty boy , The judge proceeded in the black 's employ.
Within a corner hidden , Argia lay , And heard what person_0 had been led to say.
AT length , as person_0 through a passage came , He suddenly beheld his beauteous dame.
Dance , fav ` rite ; instantly he skipped and played ; And to the judge his pretty paw conveyed.
Spaniel , scatter gold ; presently there fell Large sums of money , as the sound could tell.
Such strong temptation who can e ` er evade ? The dog a present to your wife was made.
If you , to put restraints on women choose , You 'll sooner far their fond affections lose.
OUR couple mutual compensation made , Then bade adieu to hill , and dale , and glade.
Why put such questions ? -- strict is not my pen.
The little dog , pray what of that became ? To serve the lover was his constant aim.
I added to this study that of all the traditions collected from the mouth of our Prophet by the great men that were contemporary with him.
I was not satisfied with the knowledge of all that had any relation to our religion , but made also a particular search into our histories.
I made myself perfect in polite learning , in the works of poets , and in versification.
I applied myself to geography , chronology , and to speak our Arabic tongue in its purity.
I departed with the ambassador , but with no great retinue , because of the length and difficulty of the journey.
' Having spoken thus , they surrounded and fell upon us.
The tailor listened with attention to my words ; but after I had done speaking , instead of giving me any consolation , he augmented my sorrow.
I will take care to supply you with a rope and a hatchet.
I gained a good sum of money in a short time , and repaid my tailor what he had advanced for me.
I fainted at the same moment , and lost my senses ; and when I came to myself again , I found myself in this place.
I was for a long time inconsolable , but time and necessity have accustomed me to the genie.
` Every ten days , ' continued the princess , ` the genie comes hither to see me.
' I thought myself too fortunate in having obtained so great a favor without asking it to refuse so obliging an offer.
We ate together , and passed the remaining part of the day with much satisfaction.
' I followed her advice , and my fears were so great that I forgot my hatchet and cords.
' The genie made no other answer but reproaches and blows of which I heard the noise.
For by sacrificing the fairest princess on earth to the barbarity of a merciless genie , I was become the most criminal and ungrateful of mankind.
My folly has put an end to her happiness , and brought upon her the cruelty of an unmerciful monster.
My landlord , the tailor , was very much rejoiced to see me.
I retired to my chamber , where I reproached myself a thousand times for my excessive imprudence.
` Nothing , ' said I , ` could have paralleled the princess 's good fortune and mine had I forborne to break the talisman.
' While I was thus giving myself over to melancholy thoughts , the tailor came in.
' At this discourse I changed color , and began to tremble.
While the tailor was asking me the reason , my chamber door opened , and the old man appeared to us with my hatchet and cords.
` I am a genie , ' said he , ` son of the daughter of Eblis , prince of genies.
' ` With all my heart , ' replied I , and took the scimitar in my hand.
The princess , notwithstanding her pain and suffering , understood my meaning , which she signified by an obliging look.
Upon this I stepped back , and threw the scimitar on the ground.
When I was come to myself again , I expostulated with the genie as to why he made me languish in expectation of death.
Take your choice of any of these ; I will leave it to yourself.
' These words gave me some hope to mollify him.
` Quit the shape of a man , ' said he to me , ` and take on you that of an ape.
It happened to be then a great calm , and I espied a vessel about half a league from the shore.
I launched out in this posture , and advanced near the ship.
' Some of them would not have failed to do so , if I had not got to that side where the captain was.
I threw myself at his feet , and took him by the coat in a begging posture.
Amongst the rest , some officers came on board , desiring to speak with the merchants in the name of the sultan.
You must know that we had a prime vizier who , besides having a great capacity to manage affairs , understood writing to the highest perfection.
Many people have presented their writings , but , so far , nobody in all this empire has been judged worthy to supply the vizier 's place.
' Those merchants that believed they could write well enough to aspire to this high dignity wrote one after another what they thought fit.
` Let him alone , ' said he ; ` suffer him to write.
If he only scribbles the paper , I promise you that I will punish him on the spot.
When I had done , the officers took the roll , and carried it to the sultan.
' At this command the officers could not forbear laughing.
' ` What do you say ? ' said the sultan.
' The officers returned to the vessel and showed the captain their order , who answered that the sultan 's commands must be obeyed.
The sultan dismissed his courtiers , and none remained by him but the chief of the chamberlains , a young slave , and myself.
He went from his chamber of audience into his own apartment , where he ordered dinner to be brought.
When the table was uncovered , they brought him a particular liquor , of which he caused them to give me a glass.
I drank , and wrote upon it some new verses , which explained the state I was reduced to after many sufferings.
The sultan read them likewise , and said , ' A man that was capable of doing so much would be above the greatest of men.
I kissed the ground , and laying my hand upon my head , signified that I was ready to receive that honor.
' ` Sir , ' said the princess , ` your majesty shall soon understand that I am not in the wrong.
By this science I know all enchanted persons at first sight.
I know who they are , and by whom they have been enchanted.
' ` Daughter , ' said the sultan , ` I did not believe you to have understood so much.
' ` Since it is so , ' said the sultan , ` you can dispel the prince 's enchantment.
' ` Yes , sir , ' said the princess , ` I can restore him to his first shape again.
' ` Sir , ' said the princess , ` I am ready to obey you in all that you may be pleased to command me.
' The lion answered fiercely , ` Thou shalt quickly have thy reward for the trouble thou hast given me to return.
The two parts of the lion vanished , and the head only was left , which changed itself into a large scorpion.
' These words were hardly uttered when I became a man as I was before.
I have conquered and reduced him to ashes , but I can not escape death , which is approaching.
The effect of that fire was so extraordinary that in a few moments she was wholly reduced to ashes , like the genie.
In the meantime the officers came running at the sultan 's cries , and with very much ado brought him to himself again.
There was no need for him and me to give them a long narrative of this adventure , in order to convince them of their great loss.
The two heaps of ashes , into which the princess and the genie had been reduced , were sufficient demonstration.
The sultan was hardly able to stand , but had to be supported till he could get to his apartment.
Every one was in deep mourning for seven days , and many ceremonies were performed.
This is all I have to say to you.
Depart , and beware of ever appearing again in my dominions ; no consideration whatsoever shall hinder me from making you repent of it.
And so I became a hermit"
Young Prince person_0 was brought up and educated in the palace under the care of the person_1 and Queen of person_2.
He was easily taught to read and write , and was instructed in all the sciences that became a prince of his rank.
When he arrived at the age of fifteen he was very wise and prudent.
The day for the ceremony was appointed.
After which he took his place among the crowd of viziers and emirs below the throne.
He next turned out several governors convicted of mal-administration , and put others in their place , with wonderful and just discernment.
He at length left the council , accompanied by the late king his father , and went to see his mother , Queen Gulnare.
The first year of his reign person_1 acquitted himself of all his royal functions with great care.
It required no less than a whole year for this young king to carry out his plans.
Soon after his return , the old king his father fell so dangerously ill that he knew at once he should never recover.
He would have mourned the death of his father his whole life , had it been right for a great prince thus to abandon himself to grief.
He has undergone the common law of all men , which subjects them to pay the indispensable tribute of death.
Yet we can not say absolutely that he is dead , since we see him in your sacred person.
One evening when they rose from table , they talked of various matters.
I need only mention to you the Princess Giauhara , daughter of the king of Samandal.
The few years she is older than the king my son ought not to prevent us from doing our utmost to bring it about.
Let me but know the difficulties that are to be surmounted , and we will surmount them.
Next day person_1 took leave of Queen Gulnare and the king his nephew.
He remained a good while absorbed in thought , without speaking a word.
person_1 , in the meantime , missing the king his nephew , began to be much concerned to know what had become of him.
He therefore left his company to go in search of him , and at length perceived him at a distance.
As soon as person_1 saw him lying in that disconsolate posture , he immediately guessed he had heard what passed between him and Queen Gulnare.
' person_1 would hear no more ; he advanced immediately , and showed himself to person_1.
It was not our intention you should have known anything , and we thought you were asleep.
' ` My dear uncle , ' replied person_1 , ` I heard every word , but was ashamed to disclose to you my weakness.
' These words of the person_1 of person_2 greatly embarrassed person_1.
He begged him to wait.
But these reasons were not sufficient to satisfy the person_1 of person_2.
The person_1 of person_2 kissed the queen his grandmother 's hands , and she embraced him with great joy.
The fault is committed ; I will therefore do all that I can to remedy it.
` Prince , ' replied the person_1 of Samandal , ` you would not make me such a present unless you had a request to propose.
If there be anything in my power , you may freely command it , and I shall feel the greatest pleasure in granting it.
Speak , and tell me frankly wherein I can serve you.
The thing depends so absolutely on yourself , that it would be to no purpose to ask it of any other.
I ask it then with all possible earnestness , and I beg of you not to refuse it me.
The princess is worthy of the person_1 of person_2 , and the person_1 of person_2 is no less worthy of her.
No king or prince in the world can dispute her with him.
It was some time before he could find his tongue , so much was he transported with passion.
At length , however , he broke into outrageous language , unworthy of a great king.
person_1 left sufficient guards to secure his person , and then went from apartment to apartment , in search of the Princess Giauhara.
The prince , not a little disturbed in mind , went and seated himself under the shade of a large tree.
Whilst he was endeavoring to recover himself , he heard somebody talking , but was too far off to understand what was said.
He arose and advanced softly towards the place whence the sound came , where , among the branches , he perceived a most beautiful lady.
' This said , he came forward , and approached the princess with profound reverence.
` Madam , ' said he , ` a greater happiness could not have befallen me than this opportunity to offer you my most humble services.
I beseech you , therefore , madam , to accept them , it being impossible that a lady in this solitude should not want assistance.
I am a princess , daughter of the person_1 of Samandal , and my name is Giauhara.
I had only time to save myself , and escaped hither from his violence.
' This declaration of person_1 did not produce the effect he expected.
' Upon her pronouncing these words , person_1 was immediately changed into a bird of that sort , to his great surprise and mortification.
` Take him , ' said she to one of her women , ` and carry him to the Dry Island.
' This island was only one frightful rock , where there was not a drop of water to be had.
The waiting-woman took the bird , and in executing her princess 's orders had compassion on person_1 's destiny.
Let us return to person_1.
He must have been frightened at hearing of your being in so great danger , and did not think himself in sufficient safety with us.
Their horses , indeed , they had found , but as for their persons , they knew not where to look for them.
All our endeavors have hitherto proved unsuccessful , but we must hope nevertheless to see him again , perhaps when we least expect it.
The queen her mother made her consider the necessity of not yielding too much to her grief.
' Queen Gulnare yielded.
She took leave of the queen her mother , and was back in the palace of the capital of person_2 before she had been missed.
She also governed with the prime minister and council as quietly as if the king had been present.
He felt yet more unhappy that he knew not where he was , nor in what part of the world the kingdom of person_2 lay.
He employed all his art to catch him , and at length succeeded.
As soon as he was come into the market , a citizen stops him , and asked him how much he wanted for that bird.
I set a much higher value upon him , and you should not have him for a piece of gold.
Although I am advanced in years , I never saw such a bird in my life.
I intend to make a present of him to the king ; he will know the value of him better than you.
' Without staying any longer in the market , the peasant went directly to the palace , and placed himself exactly before the king 's apartment.
The officer , going to the peasant , asked him how much he wanted for that bird.
The king ordered the bird to be put into a magnificent cage , and gave it seed and water in rich vessels.
Looking earnestly at it , he asked the officer if he had seen it eat.
' Then the king ordered him meat of various sorts , that he might take what he liked best.
The king was so surprised , that he immediately sent the officer to desire the queen to come and see this wonder.
The king , surprised at her proceeding , asked the reason of it.
The queen consented to it with great willingness.
' The words were scarcely out of the queen 's mouth , when , instead of a bird , the king saw a young prince.
person_1 immediately fell on his knees , and thanked God for the favor that had been bestowed upon him.
He would then have made his acknowledgments to the queen , but she had already retired to her apartment.
When he had done , the king , provoked at the proceeding of the princess , could not help blaming her.
But let us have done with this discourse , and tell me , I beseech you , in what I can further serve you.
The greater part of the people were instantly drowned.
Some few were saved by swimming , and others by getting on pieces of the wreck.
This made him think it was not without cause that so many animals had opposed his passage.
person_1 satisfied him in a few words ; and the old man further asked him if he had met anybody on the road.
I will satisfy your curiosity at leisure , and give you the reason why it is necessary you should take this precaution.
' person_1 would not be bidden twice : he entered the shop , and sat down by the old man.
At last he said to him , ` You have great reason to thank God you got hither without any misfortune.
' ` Alas ! why ? ' replied king person_0 , very much surprised and alarmed.
She receives them in the most obliging manner ; she caresses them , regales them , and lodges them magnificently.
But she does not suffer them long to enjoy this happiness.
There is not one of them whom she has not transformed into some animal or bird at the end of forty days.
You told me all these animals opposed your landing and entering , the city.
' This account exceedingly afflicted the young person_1 of person_2.
' person_1 thanked the old man for his kind reception , and the protection he was pleased so readily to afford him.
` Believe not , ' said the old man , ` that this is a slave ; you all know that I am not rich enough.
' The old man was exceedingly glad to hear the commendations they bestowed on the young person_1 of person_2.
He became as fond of him as if he had been his own son.
` The queen is coming by , ' answered he , ` but stand still and fear nothing.
Next came as many young ladies on foot , equally beautiful , richly dressed , and set off with precious stones.
Although my purpose were to do evil to all mankind , yet he shall be the sole exception.
He is not worthy to approach so great a queen , and I humbly beseech your majesty to excuse him.
' Old Abdallah was exceedingly grieved , both on his own account and person_1 's , for being in a manner forced to obey the queen.
I put entire confidence in your royal word , and I do not in the least doubt but you will keep it.
I only beg of your majesty to delay doing this great honor to my nephew till you shall again pass this way.
But I have some reason to believe she will treat you well , as she promised , on account of that particular esteem she professes for me.
This you may have seen by the respect shown , and the honors paid me by all her court.
' These assurances , which appeared very doubtful , were not sufficient to raise person_1 's spirits.
She knows it well herself ; and that is the reason , and no other , that she pays me such great respect.
I can quickly hinder her from doing you the least harm , if she should be perfidious enough to attempt it.
I know you are a man of your word , and I can not think you will break it with me.
' With that she threw off her veil and showed person_1 , who came near her with Abdallah , incomparable beauty.
But person_1 was little charmed.
` It is not enough , ' said he within himself , ` to be beautiful ; one 's actions ought to correspond.
He excused himself at first from receiving them , but she insisted absolutely upon it , and he could not refuse her.
She had caused a horse to be brought -LRB- as richly harnessed as her own -RRB- for the person_1 of person_2.
She looked at Abdallah , and after having made him an inclination with her head , she set forward on her march.
It is only to render thy fall most terrible that thou art raised so high.
She herself showed him all her apartments , where there was nothing to be seen but massy gold , precious stones , and furniture of wonderful magnificence.
Then she led him out into a balcony , from whence he observed a garden of surprising beauty.
person_1 commended all he saw , but so that he might not be discovered to be any other than old Abdallah 's nephew.
They discoursed of indifferent matters , till the queen was informed that dinner was upon the table.
The queen and person_1 arose , and sat down at the table , which was of massy gold , and the dishes of the same metal.
person_1 received it with profound respect , and by a very low bow signified to her majesty that he in return drank to her health.
At the same time ten of Queen Labe 's women entered with musical instruments , with which they made an agreeable concert.
Next morning the women who had served the king presented him with fine linen and a magnificent robe.
Queen Labe treated person_1 after this manner for forty days , as she had been accustomed to do to all the others.
He trembled with fear , but still pretended to sleep , that the sorceress might not discover he was awake.
' ` Go , ' said the queen , ` you have my consent ; but do not be long before you return.
' This said , she ordered him a horse richly caparisoned , and he departed.
Old Abdallah was overjoyed to see person_1 ; he embraced him tenderly , and person_1 did the same.
I thought of you immediately , and I esteem myself happy in that I have obtained permission to come to you.
But fear nothing.
I know the way to make the mischief she intends for you fall upon herself.
You are alarmed in time ; and you could not have done better than to have recourse to me.
The earth has borne this monster long enough , and it is now high time she should be treated as she deserves.
' So saying , Abdallah put two cakes into person_1 's hands , bidding him keep them to make use of as he should direct.
But she will conceal a mortal grief in her heart , and think she omitted something in the composition of her cake.
as you think fit ; which done , come to me with the animal , and I will tell you what you shall do afterwards.
' person_1 thanked Abdallah in the most expressive terms , and took his leave of him and returned to the palace.
Upon his arrival , he understood that the queen waited for him with great impatience in the garden.
He went to her , and she no sooner perceived him , than she came in great haste to meet him.
` My dear person_0 ! ' said she , ` it seems ages since I have been separated from you.
If you had stayed ever so little longer , I was preparing to come and fetch you.
He would have kept me still longer , but I tore myself away from him , to come where love calls me.
Of all he prepared for me , I have only brought away this cake , which I desire your majesty to accept.
' ` Fair queen , ' answered person_1 , receiving it with great respect , I can not sufficiently acknowledge the favor you do me.
I did not intend you any harm ; I only did it to see what you would say.
She had no sooner swallowed it than she appeared much troubled , and remained as it were motionless.
Abdallah , seeing at a distance person_1 coming with the mare , doubted not but he had done what he advised him.
` Hateful sorceress ! ' said he immediately to himself in a transport of joy , ` Heaven has at length punished thee as thou deservest.
' person_1 alighted at Abdallah 's door , and entered the shop , embracing and thanking him for all the signal services he had done him.
He related to him the whole matter , and told him that he could find no bridle fit for the mare.
' person_1 promised to remember it ; and having taken leave of the good old man , he departed.
Three days after he arrived at a great city , where , entering the suburbs , he met a venerable old man.
I should think yours were the same , did I not know she was dead.
Sell her to me , I beseech you : I will give you more than she is worth , and thank you too.
' ` Alas ! sir , ' continued the old woman , ` do not refuse me this favor.
My son and I will certainly die with grief if you do not grant it.
The surprise of person_1 , at the sight of this purse , was not small.
' The old man , who had been witness to all that was said , now began to speak.
' person_1 , sorely afflicted to find himself thus trapped by his rash offer , alighted with great regret.
Immediately rose a genie of gigantic form and stature.
Take care not to frighten her when you come before her and tell her from me what she ought to do.
' Lightning immediately disappeared , and got in an instant to the palace of the magic queen.
She went downstairs to the apartment , and she there found Queen Gulnare and Queen Farasche her mother lamenting their misfortunes.
She made them a profound obeisance and they soon understood the great need that person_1 was in of their assistance.
She then went again , and found person_1 her brother , whom Queen Farasche had caused to come speedily thither by a certain fumigation.
Both you and I must go to deliver him , for there is no time to be lost.
' person_1 forthwith assembled a powerful body of his marine troops , who soon rose out of the sea.
He also called to his assistance the genies , his allies , who appeared with a much more numerous army than his own.
' In a moment Queen Gulnare no more saw the hideous owl , but person_1 her son.
She immediately embraced him with an excess of joy.
She could not find in her heart to let him go ; and Queen Farasche was obliged to force him from her in her turn.
After her , he was likewise embraced by the king his uncle and his relations.
Queen Gulnare 's first care was to look out for old Abdallah , to whom she had been indebted for the recovery of the person_1 of person_2.
Do but tell me in what I can serve you.
There remains one more , which I desire you to think of.
' ` Madam , ' replied person_1 , ` it is to no purpose for them to take all that pains.
You have no doubt heard that I have already given my heart to the Princess of Samandal.
I have seen her , and do not repent of the present I then made her.
In a word , neither earth nor sea , in my opinion , can furnish a princess like her.
It is true that she treated me in a way that would have extinguished any affection less strong than mine.
But I hold her excused ; she could not treat me with less rigor , after I had had the king her father imprisoned.
The king your uncle need only have the person_1 of Samandal brought , and we shall soon see whether he be still of the same untractable temper.
person_1 caused a chafing-dish of coals to be brought , into which he threw a certain composition , uttering at the same time some mysterious words.
As soon as the smoke began to arise , the palace shook , and immediately the person_1 of Samandal , with person_1 's officers , appeared.
' The person_1 of Samandal did not long suffer the person_1 of person_2 to remain at his feet.
She has always been obedient to my will , and I can not think she will now oppose it.
The princess had remained where the person_1 of person_2 had left her.
The officer soon perceived her , and brought her with her women.
The preference he has given you over all other Princesses obliges us both to express our gratitude.
They were all sons of kings or princes , or persons of high rank.
person_1 at length conducted the person_1 of Samandal to his dominions , and put him in possession of them.
I have undergone the fatigue of a crown a long while , and think it is now proper for me to retire.
' The grand vizier did not wholly dissuade the sultan from such a proceeding , but sought to modify his intentions.
I did not expect such proposals to one so young as I am.
It requires time to determine on what your majesty requires of me.
' person_4 's answer extremely afflicted his father.
He contented himself with telling him he would not force his inclinations , but give him time to consider the proposal.
The sultan said no more to the prince : he admitted him into his council , and gave him every reason to be satisfied.
' He stopped here , and went out without staying to hear what the sultan would answer.
He communicated this new cause of discontent to his prime minister.
' I have followed your advice , ' said he , ` but person_3 is further than ever from complying with my desires.
He delivered his resolution in such free terms that it required all my reason and moderation to keep my temper.
Your majesty would have no cause to reproach yourself if you gave the prince another year to consider the matter.
' The year expired , and , to the great regret of the sultan , person_4 gave not the least proof of having changed his mind.
Declare yourself , then ; that , according to your answer , I may take the proper measures.
She was surprised to see a light in person_4 's chamber , and entered , without stopping , over the slave who lay at the door.
As for person_2 , she belonged to that class whom the great Solomon compelled to acknowledge him.
He would fain have avoided her , but she was so near him that he must either fight or yield.
He therefore broke silence first.
Tell me then , wandering spirit , whence thou comest , what thou hast seen , and what thou hast done this night.
' ` Fair lady , ' answered person_0 , ` you meet me at a good time to hear something very wonderful.
I come from the utmost limits of person_1 , which look on the last islands of this hemisphere.
' ` Go on , go on , cursed spirit , ' replied person_2 ; ` go on and fear nothing.
The country of person_1 , from whence I come , is one of the largest and most powerful kingdoms of the earth.
He has furnished these palaces most sumptuously , each in a manner suited to the materials that they are built of.
King Gaiour , in a word , has shown that he has spared no expense.
` Upon the fame of this incomparable princess 's beauty , the most powerful neighbouring kings sent ambassadors to request her in marriage.
' ' `` Sir ,"
` At last there came an embassy from the most rich and potent king of all.
` The king , greatly enraged , said `` Daughter , you are mad , and I must treat you as such"
I doubt not that you would think yourself obliged to me for the sight of a princess unequalled for beauty.
' ` Hold thy tongue , cursed sprite , ' replied person_2.
` I tell thee once more that that can never be.
' person_0 consented to what person_2 had proposed , and determined to set out immediately for person_1 upon that errand.
But person_2 told him she must first show him the tower whither he was to bring the princess.
' person_0 left person_2 , and flew towards person_1 , whence he soon returned with incredible speed , bringing the fair princess along with him , asleep.
person_2 received him , and introduced him into the tower of person_4 , where they placed the princess still asleep.
At once there arose a great contest between the genie and the fairy about their respective beauty.
The princess is fair , I do not deny ; but if you compare them together without prejudice , you will quickly see the difference.
' ` Though I should compare them ever so often , ' said person_0 , ' I could never change my opinion.
` Rise , Caschcasch , ' said person_2 , ` I brought you hither to determine a difference between me and person_0.
' This proposal of Caschcasch 's pleased equally both person_2 and person_0.
He raised his head and leaned on his elbow , the better to consider her.
He was going to awaken her at that instant , but suddenly refrained himself.
' The prince began to repent sincerely of the fault he had committed , and was once more upon the point of waking the person_4ss of person_1.
Who knows but he has brought her himself , and is hidden behind the curtains to make me ashamed of myself.
I will content myself with this ring , as a remembrance of her.
After this he fell into a more profound sleep than before through the enchantment of the genies.
From surprise she proceeded to admiration , and from admiration to a transport of joy.
She could not comprehend how this exchange could have been made.
Tired with her fruitless endeavors to awaken the prince , she soon fell asleep.
Another time believe me when I assert anything.
' person_0 and Caschcasch did as they were commanded , and person_2 retired to her well.
person_4 on waking next morning looked to see if the lady whom he had seen the night before were there.
When he found she was gone , he cried out , ` I thought indeed this was a trick the king my father designed to play me.
I am glad I was aware of it.
' Then he waked the slave , who was still asleep , and bade him come and dress him , without saying anything.
The slave brought a basin and water , and after he had washed and said his prayers , he took a book and read for some time.
After this , he called the slave , and said to him , ` Come hither , and look you , do not tell me a lie.
' ` I speak , ' said the prince , ` of her that came , or rather , that was brought hither.
I will drown thee , ' cried he , ` if thou dost not tell me speedily who this lady was , and who brought her.
' The slave , perplexed and half-dead , said within himself , ` The prince must have lost his senses through grief.
' The prince drew the slave up , and pressed him to tell him.
' ` I permit you , but do it quickly , ' said the prince , ` and be sure you conceal nothing.
' The slave went out , and having locked the door upon the prince , ran to the palace just as he was.
The minister endeavored to comfort his master by telling him that the prince himself had given him good cause to be angry.
` Sir , ' said he , ` your majesty need not repent of having treated your son after this sort.
' The grand vizier had just made an end of speaking when the slave came in and cast himself at the king 's feet.
The prince is distracted , my lord ; and his treatment to me , as you may see , too plainly proves it.
' Then he proceeded to tell all the particulars of what person_4 had said to him , and the violence with which he had been treated.
' ` What , ' replied the prince , ` could give my father alarm ? I have much greater cause to complain of that slave.
' At these stern words the grand vizier began to be in greater confusion than before , and was thinking how to extricate himself.
` Yes , yes , ' answered the prince , ` I have seen her , and am very well satisfied you sent her.
She played the part you had given her admirably well , for I could not get a word out of her.
She pretended to be asleep , but I was no sooner fallen into a slumber than she arose and left me.
You know all this ; for I doubt not she has been to make her report to you.
Do this quickly , and bring me a speedy answer.
person_4 received the king his father in the tower with great respect.
The king at length spoke of the lady to the prince.
I am ready to receive her at your hands with the deepest gratitude.
' The king was surprised at this answer of the prince , so remote , as he thought , from the good sense he had shown before.
After this , I hope you will be convinced that I have not lost my senses , as you have been almost made to believe.
Her nurse , who presented herself first , desired to be informed what she would please to have , and if anything disagreeable had happened to her.
I beseech you to rise.
' ` I am in earnest , ' said the princess , ` and I must know where this young man is.
' She then began to tell what had been the cause of all that violent passion in the princess.
` Your majesty must conclude from all this , madam , ' continued the nurse , ` that the princess is out of her senses.
You will think so yourself if you go and see her.
' The queen ordered the nurse to follow her ; and they went together to the princess 's palace that very moment.
You must know where he is , and therefore I beg of your majesty to let him come to me again.
' ` Daughter , ' answered the queen , ` you surprise me ; I know nothing of what you talk of.
' Here the queen endeavored to calm the princess by soft words.
He was the finest and best made youth the sun ever saw.
I entreat you , do not refuse me.
' She then reached forth her hand , and showed the king a man 's ring on her finger.
The king , exceedingly concerned at this indisposition of his daughter , sought all possible means to get her cured.
As he was well skilled in magic , he offered to cure the king 's daughter , and flattered himself he should succeed.
' The emir , however , accepted the condition , and the king conducted him to where the princess was.
' The king , enraged at his incapacity and the trouble he had given him , caused him immediately to be beheaded.
He had the same published in the other principal cities and towns of his dominions , and in the courts of the princes his neighbors.
The first that presented himself was an astrologer and magician , whom the king caused to be conducted to the princess 's prison.
The princess demanded what all these preparations were for.
' So putting up his apparatus again , he marched away , very much concerned that he had so easily undertaken to cure an imaginary malady.
' The king was very much enraged at the astrologer , and had his head cut off upon the spot.
She carried him along with her , and the officer verily believing it was her daughter , admitted them together.
' So saying , Marzavan took leave of the princess , and set out next morning on his intended journey.
Marzavan was extremely delighted to hear this , and informed himself of the place where the prince was to be found.
There were two ways to it ; one by land and sea , the other by sea only , which was the shortest way.
It went down in sight of person_4 's castle , where were at that time the king and his grand vizier.
' The first thing that struck Marzavan on entering the prince 's chamber was to find him upon his bed languishing , and with his eyes shut.
The words of Marzavan excited the prince 's curiosity so far that he opened his eyes and looked at him.
This made him so joyful , that the effects of it showed themselves in his eyes and looks.
Then his majesty demanded of him who he was , and whence he came.
' Having said thus , he left the prince to converse at full liberty with the stranger , whilst he went and rejoiced with the grand vizier.
The lady for whom you suffer is the person_4ss Badoura , daughter of Gaiour , King of person_1.
This I can assure your highness from what she has told me of her adventure , and what I have learned of yours.
She has suffered no less on your account than you have on hers.
' Here he began to relate all that he knew of the princess 's story , from the night of their extraordinary interview.
He omitted not to acquaint him how the king had treated those who had failed in their pretensions to cure the princess of her indisposition.
` But your highness is the only person , ' added he , ` that can cure her effectually , and may present yourself without fear.
However , before you undertake so great a voyage , I would have you perfectly recovered , and then we will take such measures as are necessary.
Think then immediately of the recovery of your health.
' This discourse had a marvellous effect on the prince.
The joy was soon general in the capital and every corner of his dominions.
person_4 , though extremely weakened by almost continual want of sleep and long abstinence from almost all food , soon recovered his health.
This would be a cruel disappointment to me , if you do not contrive a way to prevent it.
You see he scarcely ever leaves me.
This then is the means I have contrived to obtain your liberty.
' Next day person_4 Camaralzarnan took his opportunity.
He then ordered him to choose the best horses in his stable , and himself took particular care that nothing should be wanting.
When all was ready , his majesty embraced the prince , and having recommended the care of him to Marzavan , he let him go.
The prince demanded his reason for what he had done.
' Besides the guards and porters at the gate , this drew together a great number of people about person_4.
The prince 's good mien , noble air , and blooming youth made everybody that saw him pity him.
As soon as the prince came into the king 's presence , he bowed and kissed the ground.
But as he thought him more deserving than ordinary , he showed him more honor , and made him come and sit by him.
If I must die , sir , I shall die with the satisfaction of not having lost your esteem after I have merited it.
I beseech your majesty therefore to keep me no longer impatient to display the certainty of my art.
The officer , redoubling his pace , with much ado got up with him.
On this account they had reason to tremble on approaching the place whither I go , and where I am sure to find my happiness.
' He had just spoken these words as he was at the door.
person_4 stopt before he entered , speaking softly to the officer for fear of being heard in the princess 's chamber.
' The officer , entering the person_4ss of person_1 's chamber , gave her the packet he received from person_4.
' The officer immediately went to tell the King of person_1 what had happened.
He made use neither of schemes nor spells or perfumes , or anything else , but cured her without seeing her.
' Then he told the king how he did it.
' person_4 thanked the king in the most humble tones , that he might the better show his gratitude.
' He then told him his history.
' The marriage was solemnized the same day , and the rejoicings for it were universal all over the empire of person_1.
I HAVE made many books about well-behaved people.
Now , for a change , I am going to make a story about two disagreeable people , called person_1 and person_2.
Tod.
Nobody could call person_2.
Tod `` nice"
The rabbits could not bear him ; they could smell him half a mile off.
He was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers ; they never knew where he would be next.
One day he was living in a stick - house in the coppice , causing terror to the family of old person_2.
Benjamin Bouncer.
Next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake , frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.
In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks , under Oatmeal Crag.
He had half a dozen houses , but he was seldom at home.
The houses were not always empty when person_2.
Tod moved OUT ; because sometimes person_1 moved IN ; -LRB- without asking leave -RRB-.
person_1 was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin ; he grinned all over his face.
He was not nice in his habits.
He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms ; and he waddled about by moonlight , digging things up.
His clothes were very dirty ; and as he slept in the day-time , he always went to bed in his boots.
And the bed which he went to bed in , was generally person_2.
Tod 's.
Now person_1 did occasionally eat rabbit-pie ; but it was only very little young ones occasionally , when other food was really scarce.
He was friendly with old person_2.
Bouncer ; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and person_2.
Tod ; they often talked over that painful subject.
Old person_2.
Bouncer was stricken in years.
He sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow , in a muffler ; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.
He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy , who had a young family.
Old person_2.
Bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon , because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.
The little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick.
They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay , in a shallow burrow , separate from the main rabbit hole.
To tell the truth -- old person_2.
Bouncer had forgotten them.
He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants ' eggs , and accused person_2.
Tod of poaching them.
I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail !"
said person_1.
It was not much of a joke , but it tickled old person_2.
Bouncer ; because person_1 was so fat and stumpy and grinning.
So old person_2.
Bouncer laughed ; and pressed person_1 to come inside , to taste a slice of seed-cake and `` a glass of my daughter Flopsy 's cowslip wine"
person_1 squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.
Then old person_2.
Old person_2.
Bouncer coughed and laughed ; and person_1 puffed and grinned.
And person_2.
Bouncer laughed and coughed , and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke.
.
When Flopsy and Benjamin came back -- old person_2.
Bouncer woke up.
person_1 and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared ! person_2.
Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole.
But the smell of badger was undeniable ; and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand.
He was in disgrace ; Flopsy wrung her ears , and slapped him.
Benjamin Bunny set off at once after person_1.
There was not much difficulty in tracking him ; he had left his foot - mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood.
Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel.
There he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel ; and had set a mole trap.
A little stream crossed the way.
Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot ; the badger 's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.
Tod 's stick house was before him and , for once , person_2.
Tod was at home.
There was not only a foxey flavor in proof of it -- there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.
Benjamin Bunny sat up , staring ; his whiskers twitched.
Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate , and said something.
Benjamin stamped his foot , and bolted.
He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood.
Apparently person_1 had turned the same way.
Upon the top of the wall , there were again the marks of badger ; and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar.
Benjamin climbed over the wall , into a meadow.
He found another mole trap newly set ; he was still upon the track of person_1.
It was getting late in the afternoon.
Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air.
One of them in a blue coat by himself , was busily hunting for dandelions.
-- `` Cousin Peter ! Peter Rabbit , Peter Rabbit !"
shouted Benjamin Bunny.
The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears -- `` Whatever is the matter , Cousin Benjamin ? Is it a cat ? or John Stoat Ferret ?"
`` No , no , no ! He 's bagged my family -- person_1 -- in a sack -- have you seen him ?"
`` person_1 ? how many , Cousin Benjamin ?"
`` Seven , Cousin Peter , and all of them twins ! Did he come this way ? Please tell me quick !"
`` Yes , yes ; not ten minutes since.
he said they were caterpillars ; I did think they were kicking rather hard , for caterpillars"
`` Which way ? which way has he gone , Cousin Peter ?"
`` He had a sack with something ` live in it ; I watched him set a mole trap.
Let me use my mind , Cousin Benjamin ; tell me from the beginning"
Benjamin did so.
`` My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years ;"
said Peter reflectively , `` but there are two hopeful circumstances.
Your family is alive and kicking ; and person_1 has had refreshment.
He will probably go to sleep , and keep them for breakfast"
`` Which way ?"
`` Cousin Benjamin , compose yourself.
I know very well which way.
Because person_2.
Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to person_2.
Tod 's other house , at the top of Bull Banks.
I partly know , because he offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail 's ; he said he would be passing"
-LRB- Cottontail had married a black rabbit , and gone to live on the hill -RRB-.
Peter hid his dandelions , and accompanied the afflicted parent , who was all of a twitter.
They crossed several fields and began to climb the hill ; the tracks of person_1 were plainly to be seen.
He seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards , to rest.
`` He must be very puffed ; we are close behind him , by the scent.
What a nasty person !"
said Peter.
The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures.
Cottontail had seen person_1 passing in the distance.
Asked whether her husband was at home she replied that person_1 had rested twice while she watched him.
He had nodded , and pointed to the sack , and seemed doubled up with laughing.
-- `` Come away , Peter ; he will be cooking them ; come quicker !"
said Benjamin Bunny.
They climbed up and up ; -- `` He was at home ; I saw his black ears peeping out of the hole"
`` They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbors.
Come on Cousin Benjamin !"
When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks , they went cautiously.
The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks ; and there , beneath a crag -- person_2.
Tod had made one of his homes.
It was at the top of a steep bank ; the rocks and bushes overhung it.
The rabbits crept up carefully , listening and peeping.
This house was something between a cave , a prison , and a tumble - down pig-stye.
There was a strong door , which was shut and locked.
The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame ; but the kitchen fire was not alight.
It was neatly laid with dry sticks , as the rabbits could see , when they peeped through the window.
Benjamin sighed with relief.
But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder.
There was an immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern , and a large carving knife and fork , and a chopper.
No person was to be seen , and no young rabbits.
The kitchen was empty and silent ; the clock had run down.
Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window , and stared into the dusk.
Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house.
It was damp and smelly , and over - grown with thorns and briars.
The rabbits shivered in their shoes.
`` Oh my poor rabbit babies ! What a dreadful place ; I shall never see them again !"
sighed Benjamin.
They crept up to the bedroom window.
It was closed and bolted like the kitchen.
But there were signs that this window had been recently open ; the cobwebs were disturbed , and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the window-sill.
And as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness , they perceived that somebody was asleep on person_2.
Tod 's bed , curled up under the blanket.
-- `` He has gone to bed in his boots ,"
whispered Peter.
Benjamin , who was all of a twitter , pulled Peter off the window-sill.
person_1 's snores continued , grunty and regular from person_2.
Tod 's bed.
Nothing could be seen of the young family.
The sun had set ; an owl began to hoot in the wood.
It was a shocking place , and very dark.
They went back to the front of the house , and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window.
They tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes ; but it was of no use , especially without a light.
They sat side by side outside the window , whispering and listening.
In half an hour the moon rose over the wood.
It shone full and clear and cold , upon the house amongst the rocks , and in at the kitchen window.
And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window -- the little door opposite shook in answer.
Tod 's bed.
But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery.
After much whispering , Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel.
They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank.
They dug and dug for hours.
They could not tunnel straight on account of stones ; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor.
Benjamin was on his back , scratching upwards.
Peter 's claws were worn down ; he was outside the tunnel , shuffling sand away.
He called out that it was morning -- sunrise ; and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods.
Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel , shaking the sand from his ears ; he cleaned his face with his paws.
Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill.
In the valley there was a sea of white mist , with golden tops of trees showing through.
They did the most foolish thing that they could have done.
They rushed into their short new tunnel , and hid themselves at the top end of it , under person_2.
Tod 's kitchen floor.
person_2.
Tod was coming up Bull Banks , and he was in the very worst of tempers.
First he had been upset by breaking the plate.
Then the midges had been very bad.
And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest ; and it had contained only five eggs , two of them addled.
person_2.
Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.
As usual , when out of humor , he determined to move house.
First he tried the pollard willow , but it was damp ; and the otters had left a dead fish near it.
person_2.
Tod likes nobody 's leavings but his own.
He made his way up the hill ; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger.
No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as person_1.
person_2.
Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed ; he guessed where person_1 had gone to.
He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.
It flew from tree to tree and scolded , warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation.
Once when it flew screaming over his head -- person_2.
Tod snapped at it , and barked.
He approached his house very carefully , with a large rusty key.
He sniffed and his whiskers bristled.
The house was locked up , but person_2.
Tod had his doubts whether it was empty.
He turned the rusty key in the lock ; the rabbits below could hear it.
person_2.
Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.
The sight that met person_2.
Tod 's eyes in person_2.
Tod 's kitchen made person_2.
Tod furious.
There was person_2.
Tod 's chair , and person_2.
There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger , which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit.
But what absorbed person_2.
Tod 's attention was a noise -- a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise , coming from his own bed.
He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door.
Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry.
His whiskers bristled and his coat-collar stood on end with rage.
For the next twenty minutes person_2.
Tod kept creeping cautiously into the house , and retreating hurriedly out again.
By degrees he ventured further in -- right into the bedroom.
When he was outside the house , he scratched up the earth with fury.
But when he was inside -- he did not like the look of person_1 's teeth.
He was lying on his back with his mouth open , grinning from ear to ear.
He snored peacefully and regularly ; but one eye was not perfectly shut.
person_2.
Tod came in and out of the bedroom.
Twice he brought in his walking-stick , and once he brought in the coal-scuttle.
But he thought better of it , and took them away.
When he came back after removing the coal-scuttle , person_1 was lying a little more sideways ; but he seemed even sounder asleep.
He was an incurably indolent person ; he was not in the least afraid of person_2.
Tod ; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.
person_2.
Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line.
He stood a minute watching person_1 and listening attentively to the snores.
They were very loud indeed , but seemed quite natural.
person_2.
Tod turned his back towards the bed , and undid the window.
It creaked ; he turned round with a jump.
person_1 , who had opened one eye -- shut it hastily.
The snores continued.
person_2.
Tod 's proceedings were peculiar , and rather uneasy , -LRB- because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom -RRB-.
He opened the window a little way , and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window sill.
The rest of the line , with a hook at the end , remained in his hand.
person_1 snored conscientiously.
person_2.
Tod stood and looked at him for a minute ; then he left the room again.
person_1 opened both eyes , and looked at the rope and grinned.
There was a noise outside the window.
person_1 shut his eyes in a hurry.
person_2.
Tod had gone out at the front door , and round to the back of the house.
On the way , he stumbled over the rabbit burrow.
If he had had any idea who was inside it , he would have pulled them out quickly.
He took up the coil of line from the sill , listened for a moment , and then tied the rope to a tree.
person_1 watched him with one eye , through the window.
He was puzzled.
person_2.
Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring , and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.
person_1 snored industriously , with rather a snort.
person_2.
Tod put down the pail beside the bed , took up the end of rope with the hook -- hesitated , and looked at person_1.
The snores were almost apoplectic ; but the grin was not quite so big.
person_2.
Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead.
His legs were dangerously near to person_1 's teeth.
-LRB- person_2.
Tod 's curtains were folded up , and put away , owing to the house being unoccupied.
So was the counterpane.
person_1 was covered with a blanket only.
-RRB- person_2.
person_2.
Tod descended safely from the chair , and endeavored to get up again with the pail of water.
He very nearly overbalanced himself.
The snores became more and more apoplectic.
One of person_1 's hind legs twitched under the blanket , but still he slept on peacefully.
person_2.
Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident.
After considerable thought , he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug.
The empty pail was not too heavy for him ; he slung it up wobbling over the head of person_1.
Surely there never was such a sleeper ! person_2.
Tod got up and down , down and up on the chair.
The pail got fuller and fuller , and swung like a pendulum.
Occasionally a drop splashed over ; but still person_1 snored regularly and never moved , -- except one eye.
At last person_2.
Tod 's preparations were complete.
`` It will make a great mess in my bedroom ; but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort ,"
said person_2.
Tod.
person_2.
Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room.
He went out of the house , shutting the front door.
The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.
said person_2.
Tod.
The moment he had gone , person_1 got up in a hurry ; he rolled person_2.
He went into the kitchen , lighted the fire and boiled the kettle ; for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.
When person_2.
Tod got to the tree , he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying.
He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth.
He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes.
At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out , and quite knocked him over backwards.
Inside the house there was a great crash and splash , and the noise of a pail rolling over and over.
But no screams.
person_2.
Tod was mystified ; he sat quite still , and listened attentively.
Then he peeped in at the window.
The water was dripping from the bed , the pail had rolled into a corner.
Its head was covered by the wet blanket and it was NOT SNORING ANY LONGER.
There was nothing stirring , and no sound except the drip , drop , drop drip of water trickling from the mattress.
person_2.
Tod watched it for half an hour ; his eyes glistened.
Then he cut a caper , and became so bold that he even tapped at the window ; but the bundle never moved.
I will bring my bedding out , and dry it in the sun ,"
said person_2.
Tod.
`` I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach.
I must have a disinfecting.
Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur"
He opened the door.
person_1 was sitting at person_2.
Tod 's kitchen table , pouring out tea from person_2.
Tod 's tea-pot into person_2.
Tod 's tea-cup.
He was quite dry himself and grinning ; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over person_2.
Tod.
Then person_2.
Tod rushed upon person_1 , and person_1 grappled with person_2.
Tod amongst the broken crockery , and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen.
To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.
They crept out of their tunnel , and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes , listening anxiously.
Inside the house the racket was fearful.
The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling ; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.
Everything was upset except the kitchen table.
And everything was broken , except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender.
The crockery was smashed to atoms.
The chairs were broken , and the window , and the clock fell with a crash , and there were handfuls of person_2.
Tod 's sandy whiskers.
The vases fell off the mantelpiece , the canisters fell off the shelf ; the kettle fell off the hob.
person_1 put his foot in a jar of raspberry Jam.
And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of person_2.
Tod.
When the kettle fell , person_1 , who was still grinning , happened to be uppermost ; and he rolled person_2.
Tod over and over like a log , out at the door.
Then the snarling and worrying went on outside ; and they rolled over the bank , and down hill , bumping over the rocks.
There will never be any love lost between person_1 and person_2.
Tod.
But Benjamin was frightened -- `` Oh ; oh ! they are coming back !"
`` No they are not"
`` Yes they are !"
`` What dreadful bad language ! I think they have fallen down the stone quarry"
Still Benjamin hesitated , and Peter kept pushing him -- `` Be quick , it 's all right.
Shut the oven door , Cousin Benjamin , so that he wo n't miss them"
Decidedly there were lively doings in person_2.
Tod 's kitchen ! At home in the rabbit hole , things had not been quite comfortable.
After quarrelling at supper , Flopsy and old person_2.
Bouncer had passed a sleepless night , and quarrelled again at breakfast.
Old person_2.
Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole ; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy.
The day passed heavily.
Old person_2.
Bouncer , very sulky , was huddled up in a corner , barricaded with a chair.
Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco.
She had been having a complete turn out and spring - cleaning , to relieve her feelings.
She had just finished.
Old person_2.
Bouncer , behind his chair , was wondering anxiously what she would do next.
In person_2.
Tod 's kitchen , amongst the wreckage , Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously , through a thick cloud of dust.
He opened the oven door , felt inside , and found something warm and wriggling.
He lifted it out carefully , and rejoined Peter Rabbit.
`` I 've got them ! Can we get away ? Shall we hide , Cousin Peter ?"
Peter pricked his ears ; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.
Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down Bull Banks , half carrying half dragging a sack between them , bumpetty bump over the grass.
They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit hole.
Great was old person_2.
Bouncer 's relief and Flopsy 's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family.
The rabbit - babies were rather tumbled and very hungry ; they were fed and put to bed.
They soon recovered.
A long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to person_2.
Bouncer.
He was rather upon his dignity ; but he accepted.
Old person_2.
Bouncer was forgiven , and they all had dinner.
Tod.
The End"
They were situated in a barren country , about four leagues distant from whence he set out.
` There must be some mystery in this , ' said he to himself again , ` and it may be to my advantage.
He feared it was fastened ; but pushing against it , it opened , and discovered an easy descent , but no steps.
He walked down with his arrow in his hand.
At first he thought he was going into a dark place , but presently a quite different light succeeded that which he had come out of.
Raising her voice , she said , ` Come near , person_1 ; you are welcome.
This is sufficient to let you know that I am not unacquainted with anything that relates to you.
The only thing I have to add is , that you seemed to me worthy of a still better fortune than that of marrying the person_1ss Nouronnihar.
I was present when you drew your arrow , and foresaw it would not go beyond person_1 Houssain 's.
I took it in the air , and made it strike against the rocks near which you found it.
It is in your power to avail yourself of this favourable opportunity.
Pardon me my boldness , and do not refuse to admit into your court a prince who is entirely devoted to you.
I am , as I said , mistress here ; and must add , that the same customs are not observed among fairies as among other ladies.
` Then , ' answered the fairy , ` you are my husband , and I am your wife.
Night draws near , and it will be time for supper.
He admired the infinite number of wax candles perfumed with amber which formed an agreeable and pleasant sight.
This discourse alarmed the fairy , and made her fear it was only an excuse to leave her.
' person_1 would have thrown himself at the fairy 's feet , to show his gratitude ; but she prevented him.
' She appointed twenty horsemen , well mounted and equipped , to attend him.
When all was ready , person_1 took leave of the fairy , embraced her , and renewed his promise to return soon.
As it was not a great way to his father 's capital , person_1 soon arrived there.
The people , glad to see him again , received him with acclamations , and followed him in crowds to the sultan 's palace.
I ran and took it up , and knew it to be the same which I had shot.
At least tell me where I may hear of you , if you should fail to come , or when I may think your presence necessary.
' ` Sir , ' replied person_1 , ` what your majesty asks of me is part of the mystery I spoke of.
Pay him another visit to-morrow , and after that go and see him once a month , without speaking to me , or waiting for my leave.
I readily consent.
For several months he constantly paid him visits , and always in a richer and more brilliant equipage.
' The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favorites might not know the impression their hints had made on his mind.
He was , however , so much alarmed that he resolved to have person_1 watched , unknown to his grand vizier.
For this end he sent for a sorceress , who was introduced by a private door into his room.
Go immediately out on the road , find out where he retires , and bring me word.
The next morning person_1 set out by daybreak , without taking leave either of the sultan or of any of his court , according to custom.
The magician , seeing him coming , followed him with her eyes , till all of a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants.
She entered it , and proceeded to the spot where it terminated in many windings , looking carefully about on all sides.
But notwithstanding all her diligence she could perceive no opening , nor the iron gate which person_1 discovered.
` Good woman , ' replied person_1 , ` you are not so far from help as you imagine.
At the same time two of the prince 's attendants alighted off their horses , helped her up , and set her behind another.
When he came into the outer court of the fairy 's palace , without dismounting , he sent to tell her he wanted to speak to her.
The fairy Pari Banou came with all haste , not knowing what made person_1 return so soon.
I commend her to your care , and am persuaded that you will not abandon her.
Go and pursue your journey.
' This discourse of the fairy 's did not in the least alarm person_1.
` Drink this , ' said she , ` it is the water of the fountain of lions , and a sovereign remedy against all fevers whatsoever.
You will find the effect of it in less than an hour 's time.
When she had lain down again , the two women covered her up.
Being thus cured as by a miracle , I had rather not lose time , but continue my journey.
Except in this , she was very well satisfied with her work , and posted away to the sultan.
When she came to the capital , she went by a great many by-ways to the private door of the palace.
The melancholy you observe proceeds from another cause than the want of success.
' Then the magician related to the Sultan of the Indies the whole story of all that happened from beginning to end.
And this is the cause of the melancholy which you perceived.
I am so aware of the great importance it is to me , that I shall take advice upon it.
' He had been consulting with his favorites , when he was told of the magician 's arrival.
He ordered her to follow him to them.
' This advice all the other favorites unanimously applauded.
But they are all genies.
I know not what reason you had thus to treat a father.
Powerful as I am , it was not possible for me to have procured so great a match for you.
I therefore will make a trial this day.
Though it may be a difficult thing , she will not refuse you.
All the world knows that fairies are capable of doing the most extraordinary things.
I have married the fairy you speak of.
I love her , and am persuaded she loves me.
But I can say nothing as to the influence your majesty believes I have over her.
But the demand of a father is a command upon every child who , like me , thinks it his duty to obey him in everything.
Go , only ask her.
' person_1 could not long withstand the fairy.
` Madam , ' said he , ` God prolong the sultan my father 's life , and bless him to the end of his days.
I left him alive , and in perfect health : therefore that is not the cause of the melancholy you perceive in me.
The sultan has imposed upon me the disagreeable task of worrying you.
You know the care I have taken , with your approbation , to conceal from him my happiness at home with you.
How he has been informed of it I can not tell.
' Here the fairy Pari Banou interrupted person_1 , and said , ` But I know.
Remember what I told you of the woman who made you believe she was ill , on whom you took so much compassion.
It is she who has acquainted the sultan your father with what you took so much care to hide from him.
Once more remember it is not I , but the sultan my father who asks this favor.
Pari Banou burst out laughing.
` What ! person_1 , ' cried she , ` do you think I jest with you ? You will see presently that I am in earnest.
' The treasurer took down the tent again , reduced it to its first size , and brought it and put it into the prince 's hands.
He took it , and next day mounted his horse and went with the usual attendants to the sultan his father.
He took the tent and admired its smallness.
As he thought this might be troublesome in use , person_1 told him that its size would always be proportionate to his army.
Do me this service , and complete the duty of a good son towards a tender father.
For this reason I dare not promise to bring the water.
I leave you to your own discretion to gratify or reject this new desire.
It shall be as you please.
There is a great deal of wickedness in this demand , as you will understand by what I am going to tell you.
But let not that frighten you.
I will give you means to pass by them without any danger.
In the third place , you must be provided with a bottle , which I will give you , to bring the water in.
When it stops , as the gates will be open , you will see the four lions.
The two that are awake will , by their roaring , wake the other two.
Fill your bottle without alighting , and then return with the same speed.
The lions will be so busy eating that they will let you pass.
' person_1 set out the next morning at the time appointed by the fairy , and followed her directions carefully.
He therefore put his sword again into its scabbard.
Taking some incense out of this , and throwing it into the fire , there arose a thick cloud of smoke.
To which she replied : ` He is my husband , brother ; his name is person_0 ; he is son to the Sultan of the Indies.
It is enough for me that he is your husband.
' ` He need but lead the way ; I will follow him , ' replied Schaibar.
Here likewise the officers , at the approach of Schaibar , abandoned their posts.
I will tell you something.
There were certain men who wished to sail on dry land , and they set their sails in the wind , and sailed away over great fields.
Then they sailed over a high mountain , and there they were miserably drowned.
In that country the flies are as big as the goats are here.
Open the window , that the lies may fly out"
`` I looked down upon Tyrol ,"
said the Moon , `` and my beams caused the dark pines to throw long shadows upon the rocks.
I looked at the pictures of St.
Christopher carrying the Infant Jesus that are painted there upon the walls of the houses , colossal figures reaching from the ground to the roof.
St.
Florian was represented pouring water on the burning house , and the Lord hung bleeding on the great cross by the wayside.
To the present generation these are old pictures , but I saw when they were put up , and marked how one followed the other.
On the brow of the mountain yonder is perched , like a swallow 's nest , a lonely convent of nuns.
And the horn sounded faint and more faintly , and the convent bell drowned its expiring echoes"
The wind blew stormy and cold , the clouds flew hurriedly past ; only for a moment now and then did the Moon become visible.
He said , `` I looked down from the silent sky upon the driving clouds , and saw the great shadows chasing each other across the earth.
I looked upon a prison.
A closed carriage stood before it ; a prisoner was to be carried away.
The door was opened , and he was led forth , and fixed his eyes upon my round disc.
Clouds passed between us , as if he were not to see my face , nor I his.
My rays could only light up isolated notes , so the greater part of what was written there will ever remain dark to me.
Many , many years ago there lived in Nara , the ancient Capital of Japan , a wise State minister , by name Prince Toyonari Fujiwara.
His wife was a noble , good , and beautiful woman called person_1 Murasaki -LRB- Violet -RRB-.
They had been married by their respective families according to Japanese custom when very young , and had lived together happily ever since.
They had , however , one cause for great sorrow , for as the years went by no child was born to them.
Everything else they had that this life could give them , but it was all as nothing because the cry of their hearts was unsatisfied.
And their prayer was answered.
A daughter was born at last to the person_1 Murasaki , and great was the joy of her heart.
They both reared her with great care and tenderness , and the child grew in strength and beauty.
When the little girl was five years old her mother fell dangerously ill and all the doctors and their medicines could not save her.
Do your best not to give trouble to your nurse or any other of your family.
Perhaps your father will marry again and some one will fill my place as your mother.
Remember when you are grown up to be submissive to those who are your superiors , and to be kind to all those who are under you.
Do n't forget this.
I die with the hope that you will grow up a model woman"
person_0-person_2 listened in an attitude of respect while her mother spoke , and promised to do all that she was told.
There is a proverb which says `` As the soul is at three so it is at one hundred ,"
Not long after the death of his first wife , Prince Toyonari married again , a lady of noble birth named person_1 Terute.
Very different in character , alas ! to the good and wise person_1 Murasaki , this woman had a cruel , bad heart.
The little person_1 was very diligent , and her favorite studies were music and poetry.
When she was twelve years of age she could play so beautifully that she and her step-mother were summoned to the Palace to perform before the Emperor.
It was the Festival of the Cherry Flowers , and there were great festivities at the Court.
person_0-person_2 was a skilled musician though so young , and often astonished her masters by her wonderful memory and talent.
On this momentous occasion she played well.
And never having learned to control herself , she allowed this wicked thought to grow into the awful desire of taking her step-daughter 's life.
So one day she secretly ordered some poison and poisoned some sweet wine.
This poisoned wine she put into a bottle.
Into another similar bottle she poured some good wine.
It was the occasion of the Boys ' Festival on the fifth of May , and person_0-person_2 was playing with her little brother.
All his toys of warriors and heroes were spread out and she was telling him wonderful stories about each of them.
They were both enjoying themselves and laughing merrily with their attendants when his mother entered with the two bottles of wine and some delicious cakes.
`` You are both so good and happy"
And she filled two cups from the different bottles.
All this time she was anxiously watching the little person_1 , but to her amazement no change whatever took place in the young girl 's face.
Suddenly the little boy screamed and threw himself on the floor , doubled up with pain.
The attendants rushed for the doctor , but nothing could save the child -- he died within the hour in his mother 's arms.
When person_0-person_2 was thirteen years of age , she had already become mentioned as a poetess of some merit.
This was an accomplishment very much cultivated by the women of old Japan and one held in high esteem.
It was the rainy season at Nara , and floods were reported every day as doing damage in the neighborhood.
But this was of no avail.
Great indeed was person_0-person_2 's fear and astonishment when her father sent for her and told her what was required of her.
At last the day came and her poem was finished.
It was written on a leaflet of paper heavily flecked with gold-dust.
Strange indeed it seemed to all those standing round.
The waters ceased their roaring , and the river was quiet in direct answer to her prayer.
After this the Emperor soon recovered his health.
From that time she was called Chinjo-hime , or the Lieutenant-General person_1 , and respected and loved by all.
There was only one person who was not pleased at person_0-person_2 's success.
That one was her stepmother.
Her envy and jealousy burned in her heart like fire.
Many were the lies she carried to her husband about person_0-person_2 , but all to no purpose.
He would listen to none of her tales , telling her sharply that she was quite mistaken.
Katoda , her vassal , was bound to obey his mistress.
Unless he killed her , however , he could not return to his cruel task-mistress , so he decided to stay out in the wilderness.
She all the time trusted in her father , knowing that as soon as he returned home and found her absent , he would search for her.
He was nearly ill with anxiety.
Every one in the house told the same story -- that person_0-person_2 had suddenly disappeared , none of them knew why or whither.
For fear of scandal he kept the matter quite and searched everywhere he could think of , but all to no purpose.
They were soon ready and mounted , waiting at the gate for their lord.
He rode hard and fast to the district of the Hibari Mountains , a great company following him.
He was soon far ahead of every one , and at last found himself in a narrow picturesque valley.
As he drew nearer his surprise increased , for he could see that the reader was a beautiful girl.
The cottage was wide open and she was sitting facing the view.
Listening attentively , he heard her reading the Buddhist scriptures with great devotion.
More and more curious , he hurried on to the tiny gate and entered the little garden , and looking up beheld his lost daughter person_0-person_2.
She was so intent on what she was saying that she neither heard nor saw her father till he spoke.
`` person_0-person_2 !"
he cried , `` it is you.
my person_0-person_2 !"
`` My father , my father ! It is indeed you -- oh , my father !"
was all she could say , and running to him she caught hold of his thick sleeve , and burying her face burst into a passion of tears.
The Prince 's astonishment and indignation knew no bounds.
He gave up the hunt at once and hurried home with his daughter.
She was no longer troubled by an unkind step-mother , and her days passed happily and quietly with her father.
She had the joy of presenting her son , the future lord of the family , to her father just before he retired from active life.
To this day there is preserved a piece of needle-work in one of the Buddhist temples of Kioto.
It is a beautiful piece of tapestry , with the figure of Buddha embroidered in the silky threads drawn from the stem of the lotus.
This is said to have been the work of the hands of the good person_1"
Long , long ago there lived a great Chinese person_4 who succeeded her brother the Emperor Fuki.
She was a wonderful woman , and an able ruler.
The rebel 's name was person_0.
He was twenty-six feet high.
His body was entirely covered with hair , and his face was as black as iron.
He was a wizard and a very terrible character indeed.
person_0 was so angry at being thwarted in his desire that he raised a revolt.
His first act was to employ the Water Devil , who caused a great flood to rush over the country.
Now Jokwa , the person_4 , had two young warriors called person_3 and person_2 , and the former she made General of the front forces.
person_3 was delighted that the person_4 's choice should fall on him , and he prepared himself for battle.
He looked back and saw person_2 his comrade , riding on a white horse , in the act of unsheathing a large sword to draw upon him.
Do you dare to stop me ?"
`` Yes ,"
answered person_2.
`` I ought to lead the army.
It is you who should follow me"
At this bold reply person_3 's anger burst from a spark into a flame.
`` Dare you answer me thus ? Take that ,"
and he lunged at him with his lance.
But person_2 moved quickly aside , and at the same time , raising his sword , he wounded the head of the General 's horse.
The action was so quick that person_3 stood dazed , not knowing what to do.
So person_3 was made commander of the left wing of the front army , and person_2 of the right.
One hundred thousand soldiers followed them and marched to put down the rebel person_0.
Within a short time the two Generals reached the castle where person_0 had fortified himself.
When aware of their approach , the wizard said : `` I will blow these two poor children away with one breath"
-LRB- He little thought how hard he would find the fight.
-RRB- With these words person_0 seized an iron rod and mounted a black horse , and rushed forth like an angry tiger to meet his two foes.
As the two young warriors saw him tearing down upon them , they said to each other : `` We must not let him escape alive ,"
and they attacked him from the right and from the left with sword and with lance.
The wizard saw that both his enemies remained unscathed.
They thought every moment that they would be cut down , but they bravely struck out to swim as far as they could from person_0 's reach.
All of a sudden they found themselves in front of what seemed to be an island rising straight out of the water.
They looked up , and there stood an old man with hair as white as snow , smiling at them.
They cried to him to help them.
The old man nodded his head and came down to the edge of the water.
He rushed through the water upon the old man , and it seemed as if he would surely be killed.
But the old man appeared not in the least dismayed , and calmly awaited the wizard 's onslaught.
So they presented themselves before the person_4 Jokwa.
Now person_1 , the Fire King , lived at the South Pole.
To look at he was a giant , and stood thirty feet high.
His face was just like marble , and his hair and beard long and as white as snow.
His strength was stupendous , and he was master of all fire just as person_0 was of water.
`` Surely ,"
thought the person_4 , `` person_1 can conquer person_0"
So she sent person_2 to the South Pole to beg person_1 to take the war against person_0 into his own hands and conquer him once for all.
person_2 was surprised at learning this.
person_1 did as he was asked , and returned with person_2 to the person_4.
His reply was very reassuring : `` Do not have any anxiety.
I will certainly kill person_0"
person_1 then placed himself at the head of thirty thousand soldiers , and with person_3 and person_2 showing him the way , marched to the enemy 's castle.
The Fire King knew the secret of person_0 's power , and he now told all the soldiers to gather a certain kind of shrub.
This they burned in large quantities , and each soldier was then ordered to fill a bag full of the ashes thus obtained.
Then he repeated an incantation , and the water-floods rose and welled as high as mountains.
person_1 , not in the least frightened , ordered his soldiers to scatter the ashes which he had caused them to make.
person_2 rode to meet him , and the two fought together for some time.
They were well matched in a hand-to-hand combat.
I will not hurt such a good man"
And he pretended to retreat , turning away the head of his horse.
His intention was to throw person_3 off his guard and then to wheel round and take him by surprise.
But person_1 understood the wily wizard , and he spoke at once : `` You are a coward ! You can not deceive me !"
Saying this , the Fire King made a sign to the unwary person_3 to attack him.
person_0 now turned upon person_1 furiously , but he was tired and unable to fight well , and he soon received a wound in his shoulder.
He now broke from the fray and tried to escape in earnest.
While the fight between their leaders had been going on the two armies had stood waiting for the issue.
person_1 now turned and bade Jokwa 's soldiers charge the enemy 's forces.
This they did , and routed them with great slaughter , and the wizard barely escaped with his life.
It was in vain that person_0 called upon the Water Devil to help him , for person_1 knew the counter-charm.
The wizard found that the battle was against him.
There was an end of the wicked person_0 , but not of trouble in the person_4 Jokwa 's Kingdom , as you shall see.
She showered all manner of gifts and honors upon person_1.
But all this time fire was bursting from the mountain broken by the fall of person_0.
Whole villages were destroyed , rice-fields burnt up , river beds filled with the burning lava , and the homeless people were in great distress.
So the person_4 left the capital as soon as she had rewarded the victor person_1 , and journeyed with all speed to the scene of disaster.
Having ascertained this , she set to work at repairs.
To this end she ordered her subjects to collect stones of five colors -- blue , yellow , red , white and black.
Now all was ready.
She soon reached the corner of the sky that was broken , and applied the paste and mended it.
Having done this , she turned her attention to the broken pillar , and with the legs of a very large tortoise she mended it.
Neither the sun shone by day nor the moon by night.
Neither the Sun could make his daily journey nor the Moon her nightly one because of the bad roads.
The person_4 approved of what the wise men suggested , and ordered them to set out on their mission.
But this was not easy , for the Palace of the Sun and Moon was many , many hundreds of thousands of miles distant into the East.
If they traveled on foot they might never reach the place , they would die of old age on the road.
But Jokwa had recourse to magic.
She gave her two ambassadors wonderful chariots which could whirl through the air by magic power a thousand miles per minute.
`` You need have no anxiety about the broken pillar ,"
said the two ambassadors.
`` Our person_4 restored it with the legs of a great tortoise , and it is as firm as ever it was"
Then the Sun and Moon appeared satisfied , and they both set out to try the roads.
They found that what the person_4 's deputies had told them was correct.
After the examination of the heavenly roads , the Sun and Moon again gave light to the earth.
All the people rejoiced greatly , and peace and prosperity were secured in China for a long time under the reign of the wise person_4 Jokwa"
`` Yes , it 's all very well for you to sing ,"
`` Yes , it 's all very well for you to sing , you that have all your limbs uninjured.
But after all it is well that there should be somebody at least who is merry.
I 've no reason to sing , and , moreover , I ca n't sing.
Yes , when I was a whole bottle , I sung out well if they rubbed me with a cork.
I have gone through a great deal , when I come to recollect.
And now the person_0-neck told its story , which was sufficiently remarkable.
All the bottles were packed up , and our bottle was among them.
There it lay , empty and without a cork , and felt strangely unwell , as if it wanted something , it could not tell what.
At last it was filled with good costly wine , and was provided with a cork , and sealed down.
A ticket was placed on it , marked `` first quality ;"
`` Ah , how beautiful is life !"
One morning the bottle was bought , for the tanner 's apprentice was dispatched for a bottle of wine -- `` of the best"
She was young and pretty ; her brown eyes laughed , and round her mouth played a smile as elegant as that in her eyes.
The provision basket was in the lap of the young girl when the family drove out into the forest.
The bottle-neck looked out from the folds of the white napkin.
There was red wax upon the cork , and the bottle looked straight into the girl 's face.
It also looked at the young sailor who sat next to the girl.
He was a friend of old days , the son of the portrait painter.
The young people sauntered through the green wood , and talked to one another.
What were they talking of ? No , the bottle could not hear that , for it was in the provision basket.
The father took the full bottle and the corkscrew in his hand.
`` Health to the betrothed pair !"
cried the papa ; and every glass was emptied to the dregs , and the young mate kissed his beautiful bride.
`` Happiness and blessing !"
said the two old people , the father and mother ; and the young man filled the glasses again.
`` Safe return , and a wedding this day next year !"
And so saying he hurled it high into the air.
The tanner 's daughter did not then think that she should see the bottle fly again ; and yet it was to be so.
`` I gave them wine , and they gave me marsh-water ,"
he said ; `` but it was all meant for the best"
He could no longer see the betrothed couple and the cheerful old people ; but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing.
The new big bottle was to go , and not the little one ; and so the bottle went traveling again.
It was taken on board for Peter Jensen , in the very same ship in which the young mate sailed.
-LRB- Illustration : THE BOTTLE IS PRESENT ON A JOYOUS OCCASION.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa Certainly it had no longer wine to give , but still it contained something that was just as good.
Accordingly , whenever Peter Jensen brought it out , it was dubbed by his messmates The Apothecary.
It contained the best medicine , medicine that strengthened the weak , and it gave liberally so long as it had a drop left.
The mainmast was shivered , and a wave started one of the planks , and the pumps became useless.
It was black night.
The ship sank , and the crew sank with her.
The bottle sped on like a bird , for it bore a heart , a loving letter , within itself.
Beyond this it was its own master , but one may grow tired even of that.
The bottle was fished out and examined on all sides.
For full twenty years it stood up in the loft ; and it might have remained there longer , but that the house was to be rebuilt.
`` If I had been down in the room ,"
thought the person_0 , `` I might have learned it"
It was now washed and rinsed , and indeed this was requisite.
The bottle was filled with seeds , though it scarcely knew what they were.
It was corked , and well wrapped up.
`` What trouble they have taken over yonder with that bottle !"
it heard people say ; `` and yet it is most likely broken"
But it was not broken.
At last people came down into the cellar to carry off all the bottles , and ours among the rest.
Out in the garden there was a great festival.
Flaming lamps hung like garlands , and paper lanterns shone transparent , like great tulips.
A great crowd had assembled to witness the sight ; military music had been provided , and many other preparations had been made.
or the `` down ;"
`` This is a wonderful passage , up into the air !"
thought the person_0 ; `` this is a new way of sailing ; at any rate , up here we can not strike upon anything"
The bottle had no respite for thought ; for it was quite startled at thus suddenly reaching the highest point in its career.
Steeples and roofs lay far , far beneath , and the people looked like mites.
`` That would do capitally for a bird-glass ,"
`` Yes , it 's very well for you to sing ,"
said the person_0-neck ; and it was considered remarkable for having been in the balloon -- for that was all they knew of its history.
An old friend had just come to visit her , and they talked -- not of the bottle-neck , but about the myrtle in the window.
`` No , you certainly must not spend a dollar for your daughter 's bridal wreath ,"
said the old maid.
`` You shall have a beautiful little nosegay from me , full of blossoms.
There were tears in the eyes of the old maid.
ONCE upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes.
Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.
The eight little pigs had very fine appetites.
`` Yus , yus , yus ! they eat and indeed they DO eat !"
said Aunt Pettitoes , looking at her family with pride.
Suddenly there were fearful squeals ; person_0 had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.
Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.
Chin-chin was already in disgrace ; it was washing day , and he had eaten a piece of soap.
And presently in a basket of clean clothes , we found another dirty little pig.
`` Tchut , tut , tut ! whichever is this ?"
grunted Aunt Pettitoes.
I went into the garden ; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots.
I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.
Cross-patch tried to bite me.
`` Aunt Pettitoes , Aunt Pettitoes ! you are a worthy person , but your family is not well brought up.
Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and person_1ling person_3"
`` Yus , yus !"
sighed Aunt Pettitoes.
Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether"
`` Yus , yus , yus ,"
said Aunt Pettitoes , `` there will be more to eat without them"
So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went away in a wheel-barrow , and Stumpy , Yock-yock and Cross - patch rode away in a cart.
And the other two little boy pigs , person_1ling person_3 and person_0 , went to market.
We brushed their coats , we curled their tails and washed their little faces , and wished them good-bye in the yard.
Take your brother person_0 by the hand.
Mind your Sunday clothes , and remember to blow your nose"
-- -LRB- Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again -RRB- -- `` beware of traps , hen roosts , bacon and eggs ; always walk upon your hind legs"
person_1ling person_3 , who was a sedate little pig , looked solemnly at his mother , a tear trickled down his cheek.
Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other -- `` Now son person_0 take the hand"
-- `` Wee , wee , wee !"
giggled person_0 -- `` take the hand of your brother person_1ling person_3 , you must go to market.
Mind --"
`` Wee , wee , wee !"
interrupted person_0 again.
`` You put me out ,"
said Aunt Pettitoes.
`` Observe sign-posts and milestones ; do not gobble herring bones --"
`` And remember ,"
said I impressively , `` if you once cross the county boundary you can not come back.
person_0 , you are not attending.
Here are two licences permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire.
Attend , person_0.
I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman"
person_1ling person_3 listened gravely ; person_0 was hopelessly volatile.
Then they started.
person_1ling person_3 and person_0 trotted along steadily for a mile ; at least person_1ling person_3 did.
person_0 made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side.
person_1ling person_3 and person_0 sat down and untied their bundles.
person_0 gobbled up his dinner in no time ; he had already eaten all his own peppermints.
`` Give me one of yours , please , person_1ling"
`` But I wish to preserve them for emergencies ,"
said person_1ling person_3 doubtfully.
person_0 went into squeals of laughter.
person_1ling person_3 reproved person_0.
`` What 's that , young sirs ? Stole a pig ? Where are your licences ?"
said the policeman.
They had nearly run against him round a corner.
person_1ling person_3 pulled out his paper ; person_0 , after fumbling , handed over something scrumply -- `` To 2 --> 2 1\ oz.
conversation sweeties at three farthings"
-- `` What 's this ? This ai n't a licence"
person_0 's nose lengthened visibly , he had lost it.
`` I had one , indeed I had , Mr.
Policeman !"
`` It 's not likely they let you start without.
I am passing the farm.
You may walk with me"
`` Can I come back too ?"
inquired person_1ling person_3.
`` I see no reason , young sir ; your paper is all right"
person_1ling person_3 did not like going on alone , and it was beginning to rain.
But it is unwise to argue with the police ; he gave his brother a peppermint , and watched him out of sight.
To conclude the adventures of person_0 -- the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time , followed by a damp subdued little pig.
I disposed of person_0 in the neighborhood ; he did fairly well when he had settled down.
person_1ling person_3 went on alone dejectedly ; he came to cross-roads and a sign-post -- `` To Market Town , 5 miles ,"
`` Over the Hills , 4 miles ,"
`` To Pettitoes Farm , 3 miles"
He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills , and then set off walking obediently the other way , buttoning up his coat against the rain.
said person_1ling person_3.
He took a wrong turn -- several wrong turns , and was quite lost.
It grew dark , the wind whistled , the trees creaked and groaned.
person_1ling person_3 became frightened and cried `` Wee , wee , wee ! I ca n't find my way home !"
said person_1ling person_3 , wet and cold and quite tired out.
`` Bacon and eggs , bacon and eggs !"
clucked a hen on a perch.
`` Trap , trap , trap ! cackle , cackle , cackle !"
scolded the disturbed cockerel.
`` To market , to market ! jiggetty jig !"
clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him.
person_1ling person_3 , much alarmed , determined to leave at daybreak.
In the meantime , he and the hens fell asleep.
In less than an hour they were all awakened.
The owner , Mr.
Peter Thomas Piperson , came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning.
He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock ; then his eye fell upon person_1ling person_3 , squeezed up in a corner.
He made a singular remark -- `` Hallo , here 's another !"
-- seized person_1ling by the scruff of the neck , and dropped him into the hamper.
Then he dropped in five more dirty , kicking , cackling hens upon the top of person_1ling person_3.
The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight ; it was taken down hill , unsteadily , with jerks.
person_1ling , although nearly scratched to pieces , contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.
At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor , the lid was opened , and person_1ling was lifted out.
He looked up , blinking , and saw an offensively ugly elderly man , grinning from ear to ear.
`` This one 's come of himself , whatever ,"
said Mr.
Piperson , turning person_1ling 's pockets inside out.
person_1ling person_3 drew forward a coppy stool , and sat on the edge of it , shyly warming his hands.
Mr.
Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen.
There was a smothered noise -- `` Shut up !"
said Mr.
Piperson.
person_1ling person_3 warmed his hands , and eyed him.
Mr.
Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first , there was again a curious noise -- `` Be quiet , will ye ?"
said Mr.
Piperson.
person_1ling person_3 sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.
Mr.
Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge.
Mr.
person_1ling person_3 ate his supper discreetly.
After supper Mr.
Piperson consulted an almanac , and felt person_1ling 's ribs ; it was too late in the season for curing bacon , and he grudged his meal.
Besides , the hens had seen this pig.
He looked at the small remains of a flitch , and then looked undecidedly at person_1ling.
`` You may sleep on the rug ,"
said Mr.
Peter Thomas Piperson.
person_1ling person_3 slept like a top.
In the morning Mr.
Piperson made more porridge ; the weather was warmer.
He looked to see how much meal was left in the chest , and seemed dissatisfied -- `` You 'll likely be moving on again ?"
said he to person_1ling person_3.
Before person_1ling could reply , a neighbor , who was giving Mr.
Piperson and the hens a lift , whistled from the gate.
Mr.
said Mr.
Piperson.
It crossed person_1ling 's mind that if HE had asked for a lift , too , he might still have been in time for market.
But he distrusted Peter Thomas.
After finishing breakfast at his leisure , person_1ling had a look round the cottage ; everything was locked up.
He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen.
person_1ling ate the peel , and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket.
` Over the hills and far away ! '"
Suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in -- `` Over the hills and a great way off , The wind shall blow my top knot off !"
person_1ling person_3 put down a plate which he was wiping , and listened.
After a long pause , person_1ling went on tip-toe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen.
There was nobody there.
After another pause , person_1ling approached the door of the locked cupboard , and snuffed at the key - hole.
It was quite quiet.
After another long pause , person_1ling pushed a peppermint under the door.
It was sucked in immediately.
In the course of the day person_1ling pushed in all the remaining six peppermints.
When Mr.
Mr.
Piperson was very affable ; he slapped person_1ling on the back , made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest.
He did lock the cupboard door ; but without properly shutting it.
He went to bed early , and told person_1ling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock.
person_1ling person_3 sat by the fire , eating his supper.
All at once at his elbow , a little voice spoke -- `` My name is person_1 - wig.
Make me more porridge , please !"
person_1ling person_3 jumped , and looked round.
A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.
She had twinkly little screwed up eyes , a double chin , and a short turned up nose.
She pointed at person_1ling 's plate ; he hastily gave it to her , and fled to the meal chest.
`` How did you come here ?"
asked person_1ling person_3.
`` Stolen ,"
replied person_1-wig , with her mouth full.
person_1ling helped himself to meal without scruple.
`` What for ?"
`` Bacon , hams ,"
replied person_1-wig cheerfully.
`` Why on earth do n't you run away ?"
exclaimed the horrified person_1ling.
`` I shall after supper ,"
said person_1 - wig decidedly.
person_1ling person_3 made more porridge and watched her shyly.
She finished a second plate , got up , and looked about her , as though she were going to start.
`` You ca n't go in the dark ,"
said person_1ling person_3.
person_1-wig looked anxious.
`` Do you know your way by daylight ?"
`` I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river.
Which way are YOU going , Mr.
person_1 ?"
`` To market -- I have two pig papers.
I might take you to the bridge ; if you have no objection ,"
said person_1ling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool.
person_1-wig 's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to person_1ling person_3.
He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep.
She became quiet , and there was a smell of peppermint.
`` I thought you had eaten them ,"
said person_1ling , waking suddenly.
`` Only the corners ,"
replied person_1 - wig , studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight.
`` I wish you would n't ; he might smell them through the ceiling ,"
said the alarmed person_1ling.
person_1-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket ; `` Sing something ,"
she demanded.
`` I am sorry.
I have tooth - ache ,"
said person_1ling much dismayed.
`` Then I will sing ,"
replied person_1-wig.
`` You will not mind if I say iddy tidditty ? I have forgotten some of the words"
person_1ling person_3 made no objection ; he sat with his eyes half shut , and watched her.
-LRB- Ti idditty idditty -RRB- umph , umph , umph ! and the little pigs said , wee , wee !"
She sang successfully through three or four verses , only at every verse her head nodded a little lower , and her little twinkly eyes closed up.
person_1ling person_3 , on tip-toe , covered her up with an antimacassar.
Piperson overhead.
Early in the morning , between dark and daylight , person_1ling tied up his little bundle and woke up person_1 - wig.
She was excited and half - frightened.
`` But it 's dark ! How can we find our way ?"
`` The cock has crowed ; we must start before the hens come out ; they might shout to Mr.
Piperson"
person_1-wig sat down again , and commenced to cry.
`` Come away person_1-wig ; we can see when we get used to it.
Come ! I can hear them clucking !"
person_1ling had never said shuh ! to a hen in his life , being peaceable ; also he remembered the hamper.
He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them.
There was no garden ; the neighborhood of Mr.
Piperson 's was all scratched up by fowls.
They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.
The sun rose while they were crossing the moor , a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills.
The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys , where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards.
`` That 's Westmorland ,"
said person_1-wig.
`` Come , person_1-wig , we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring"
`` Why do you want to go to market , person_1ling ?"
inquired person_1-wig presently.
`` I do n't want ; I want to grow potatoes"
`` Have a peppermint ?"
said person_1-wig.
person_1ling person_3 refused quite crossly.
`` Does your poor toothy hurt ?"
inquired person_1-wig.
person_1ling person_3 grunted.
person_1-wig ate the peppermint herself and followed the opposite side of the road.
`` person_1-wig ! keep under the wall , there 's a man ploughing"
person_1-wig crossed over , they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.
Suddenly person_1ling stopped ; he heard wheels.
Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman 's cart.
The reins flapped on the horse 's back , the grocer was reading a newspaper.
`` Take that peppermint out of your mouth , person_1-wig , we may have to run.
Do n't say one word.
Leave it to me.
And in sight of the bridge !"
said poor person_1ling , nearly crying.
He began to walk frightfully lame , holding person_1-wig 's arm.
The grocer , intent upon his news - paper , might have passed them , if his horse had not shied and snorted.
He pulled the cart crossways , and held down his whip.
`` Hallo ! Where are YOU going to ?"
-- person_1ling person_3 stared at him vacantly.
`` Are you deaf ? Are you going to market ?"
person_1ling nodded slowly.
`` I thought as much.
It was yesterday.
Show me your licence ?"
person_1ling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer 's horse which had picked up a stone.
The grocer flicked his whip -- `` Papers ? person_1 licence ?"
person_1ling fumbled in all his pockets , and handed up the papers.
The grocer read them , but still seemed dissatisfied.
`` This here pig is a young lady ; is her name person_0 ?"
person_1-wig opened her mouth and shut it again ; person_1ling coughed asthmatically.
The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper -- `` Lost , stolen or strayed , 10s.
reward"
He looked suspiciously at person_1-wig.
Then he stood up in the trap , and whistled for the ploughman.
`` You wait here while I drive on and speak to him ,"
said the grocer , gathering up the reins.
He knew that pigs are slippery ; but surely , such a VERY lame pig could never run ! `` Not yet , person_1-wig , he will look back"
The grocer did so ; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road.
`` Now , person_1-wig , NOW !"
said person_1ling person_3.
Never did any pigs run as these pigs ran ! They raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge.
Little fat person_1 - wig 's petticoats fluttered , and her feet went pitter , patter , pitter , as she bounded and jumped.
There was a certain merchant who had two children , a boy and a girl ; they were both young , and could not walk.
Then said the merchant , `` If thou couldst help me I would willingly tell thee"
`` Who knows ?"
replied the black dwarf.
`` Perhaps , I can help thee"
Then the merchant told him that all he possessed had gone to the bottom of the sea , and that he had nothing left but this field.
`` Do not trouble thyself ,"
said the dwarf.
The merchant thought , `` What can that be but my dog ?"
and did not remember his little boy , so he said yes , gave the black man a written and sealed promise , and went home.
Then he was happy again , made purchases , became a greater merchant than before , and felt that this world was well-governed.
In the meantime the boy grew tall , and at the same time sharp and clever.
But the nearer the twelfth year approached the more anxious grew the merchant , so that his distress might be seen in his face.
One day his son asked what ailed him , but the father would not say.
Then said the son , `` Oh , father , do not be uneasy , all will go well.
The black man has no power over me"
Then came the black dwarf and said to the old man , `` Hast thou brought with thee that which thou hast promised me ?"
He was silent , but the son asked , `` What dost thou want here ?"
Then said the black dwarf , `` I have to speak with thy father , and not with thee"
The son replied , `` Thou hast betrayed and misled my father , give back the writing"
`` No ,"
said the black dwarf , `` I will not give up my rights"
So he took leave of his father , placed himself in a little boat , and the father had to push it off with his own foot.
The boat capsized so that the keel was uppermost , and the father believed his son was lost , and went home and mourned for him.
Then he landed and saw a beautiful castle before him , and set out to go to it.
But when he entered it , he found that it was bewitched.
He went through every room , but all were empty until he reached the last , where a snake lay coiled in a ring.
`` How can I do that ?"
he inquired.
I will come to thee , and will have , in a bottle , some of the water of life.
I will rub thee with that , and then thou wilt come to life again , and be as healthy as before"
Then said he , `` I will gladly set thee free"
So she threw herself into his arms and kissed him , and there was joy and gladness in the whole castle.
After this their marriage was celebrated , and he was King of the Golden Mountain.
They lived very happily together , and the Queen bore a fine boy.
Eight years had already gone by , when the King bethought him of his father ; his heart was moved , and he wished to visit him.
The Queen , however , would not let him go away , and said , `` I know beforehand that it will cause my unhappiness ;"
but he suffered her to have no rest until she consented.
That he promised her , put the ring on his finger , and wished himself at home , just outside the town where his father lived.
Then the shepherd said to his parents , `` I am verily your son.
Do you know of no mark on my body by which you could recognize me ?"
`` Yes ,"
said his mother , `` our son had a raspberry mark under his right arm"
He slipped back his shirt , and they saw the raspberry under his right arm , and no longer doubted that he was their son.
He said , `` I have done it thoughtlessly , and not with evil intention ,"
and tried to calm her , and she pretended to believe this ; but she had mischief in her mind.
And he laid his head on her lap , and fell asleep.
`` Home to thy parents thou canst not return ,"
thought he , `` they would say that thou wast a wizard ; thou must be off , and walk on until thou arrivest in thine own kingdom"
He said , `` Give me the three things that I may see if they are still in good condition"
They gave him the cloak , and when he had put it on , he was invisible and changed into a fly.
Then he resumed his own form and said , `` The cloak is a good one , now give me the sword"
Nevertheless they gave it to him with the condition that he was only to try it against a tree.
This he did , and the sword cut in two the trunk of a tree as if it had been a blade of straw.
`` Oh , no ,"
said he , `` I will not do that"
So they gave him the boots as well.
and at the same moment he vanished from the sight of the giants , and thus their inheritance was divided.
Then he fell into a rage , and said , `` False woman , she betrayed and deserted me whilst I was asleep !"
So he put on his cloak , and unseen by all went into the palace.
When he entered the dining-hall a great table was spread with delicious food , and the guests were eating and drinking , and laughing , and jesting.
She sat on a royal seat in the midst of them in splendid apparel , with a crown on her head.
He placed himself behind her , and no one saw him.
She was always helping herself to something , and yet she never got anything , for plate and glass disappeared immediately.
Then dismayed and ashamed , she arose and went to her chamber and wept , but he followed her there.
She said , `` Has the devil power over me , or did my deliverer never come ?"
Have I deserved this from thee ?"
Then he made himself visible , went into the hall , and cried , `` The wedding is at an end , the true King has returned"
On this they tried to seize him and pressed upon him , but he drew his sword and said , `` All heads off but mine ,"
and all the heads rolled on the ground , and he alone was master , and once more King of the Golden Mountain"
Once there was a king called King Dantal , who had a great many rupees and soldiers and horses.
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them.
King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.
When person_0 woke she told her father of the angel 's visit to her as she slept ; but her father paid no attention to her story.
From that time she began repeating , `` person_1 , person_1 ; I want person_1 ,"
and would say nothing else.
Even as she sat and ate her food she kept saying , `` person_1 , person_1 ; I want person_1"
Her father used to get quite vexed with her.
`` Who is this person_1 ? who ever heard of this person_1 ?"
he would say.
`` He is the man I am to marry ,"
said person_0.
`` Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but person_1"
And she was half mad.
All the time she kept saying , `` person_1 , person_1 ; I want person_1"
The prince heard her , and turned round.
`` Who is calling me ?"
he asked.
`` Very well , you shall have him for your husband ,"
said Munsuk Raja.
`` We will ask him to-morrow"
person_0 consented to wait , although she was very impatient.
As it happened , the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night , and when person_0 heard he was gone , she went quite mad.
All the time she kept saying , `` person_1 , person_1 ; I want person_1 ;"
and so she wandered about for twelve years.
`` I think you will never get there ,"
said the fakir , `` for it is very far from hence , and you have to cross many rivers to reach it"
But person_0 said she did not care ; she must see Prince person_1.
`` Well ,"
She went on and on , and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river.
There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish.
It was yawning just as she got up to it , and she instantly jumped down its throat into its stomach.
All the time she kept saying , `` person_1 , person_1"
At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he could.
By degrees he got tired and went slower , and a crow came and perched on his back , and said `` Caw , caw"
`` Oh , Mr.
Crow ,"
said the poor fish `` do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise"
`` Very well ,"
said the crow , `` open your mouth wide , and I 'll fly down and see"
So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down , but he came up again very quickly.
`` You have a Rakshas in your stomach ,"
said the crow , and he flew away.
This news did not comfort the poor Rohu , and he swam on and on till he came to Prince person_1 's country.
There he stopped.
And a jackal came down to the river to drink.
`` Oh , jackal ,"
said the Rohu `` do tell me what I have inside me"
`` How can I tell ?"
said the jackal.
`` I can not see unless I go inside you"
So off he ran.
After the jackal came an enormous snake.
`` Oh ,"
'"
The snake said , `` Open your mouth wide , and I 'll go down and see what it is"
`` If you do that , I shall die ,"
said the Rohu.
`` Oh , no ,"
said the snake , `` you will not , for I will give you a medicine that will make you quite well again"
So the fish agreed , and the snake got a knife and cut him open , and out jumped person_0.
She was now very old.
There some men heard her crying , `` person_1 , person_1 ; I want person_1 ,"
and they asked her what she wanted.
`` I want King person_1 ,"
she said.
So they went in and said to Prince person_1 , `` An old woman outside says she wants you"
`` I can not leave this place ,"
said he ; `` send her in here"
They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted.
`` I want to marry you ,"
she answered.
Then I went mad , and I have wandered about all these years looking for you"
Prince person_1 said , `` Very good"
`` Pray to Khuda ,"
said person_0 , `` to make us both young again , and then we shall be married"
When he touched person_0 's clothes they caught fire , and she and he became young again.
And there were great feasts , and they were married , and traveled to the Phalana country to see her father and mother.
When person_0 saw their blindness , she prayed to Khuda to restore their sight to them , which he did.
They used to go out hunting , and they often went from country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves.
One day Prince person_1 said to person_0 , `` Let us go through this jungle"
`` No , no ,"
said person_0 ; `` if we go through this jungle , some harm will happen to me"
But Prince person_1 laughed , and went into the jungle.
And as they were going through it , Khuda thought , `` I should like to know how much Prince person_1 loves his wife.
Would he be very sorry if she died ? And would he marry another wife ? I will see"
After a great many years he grew more cheerful and happy , and began to go again into his father 's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat.
King Dantal wished his son to marry again.
`` I will only have person_0 for my wife ; I will not marry any other woman ,"
said Prince person_1.
`` How can you marry person_0 ? person_0 is dead.
She will never come back to you ,"
said the father.
`` Then I 'll not have any wife at all ,"
said Prince person_1.
Meanwhile person_0 was living in the jungle where her husband had left her a little heap of ashes.
`` Well ,"
So the angel came to person_0 again as a fakir and carried her to King Dantal 's garden.
`` Now ,"
He then told her what she must do as a little dog to regain her human form.
person_0 stayed in the garden , hidden in the tall grass , till Prince person_1 and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden.
`` Oh , look , look !"
he cried , `` see what is following you ; it is a Rakshas or a demon , and I am sure it is going to eat us"
person_0 looked at him beseechingly with all her eyes , and trembled with age and eagerness ; but this only frightened person_1 the more.
`` It is a Rakshas , a Rakshas !"
he cried , and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir 's son ; and as they ran away , person_0 disappeared into the jungle.
They ran to King Dantal , and person_1 told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the garden that had come to eat them.
`` What nonsense ,"
said his father.
Indeed King Dantal did not believe person_1 had seen anything at all , till Husain Mahamat said the prince was speaking the exact truth.
However , Prince person_1 would not walk in the garden any more.
Poor person_0 answered , `` Do n't you know me ? I am your wife person_0 , and I want to marry you.
and he was in great terror.
In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog , and the prince went to his father and told him all that had happened.
`` An old woman ! an old woman ! always an old woman !"
said his father.
`` You do nothing but think of old women.
How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened ?"
How can I marry such an old woman as you are ?"
I have loved you all these long , long years.
`` Well ,"
said person_1 , `` if you can make yourself a young girl again , I will marry you"
person_0 said , `` Oh , that is quite easy.
Khuda will make me a young girl again.
In two days ' time you must go into the garden , and there you will see a beautiful fruit.
In the morning person_0 took her little dog 's form , and disappeared in the garden.
Prince person_1 told all this to his father , who told him to do all the old woman had bidden him.
In two days ' time he and the Wazir 's son walked in the garden , and there they saw a large , lovely red fruit.
`` Oh !"
said the Prince , `` I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit"
`` No ,"
At the sight of her extreme beauty , person_1 fell backwards fainting on the floor.
King Dantal answered , `` It is because you are so beautiful.
You are far , far more beautiful than you ever were.
But he will be very happy directly"
Then the King got some water , and they bathed person_1 's face and gave him some to drink , and he sat up again.
Then person_0 said , `` Why did you faint ? Did you not see I am person_0 ?"
`` Oh !"
After some time had passed very happily , Prince person_1 and his wife went out to eat the air.
They rode on the same horse , and had only a groom with them.
They came to another kingdom , to a beautiful garden.
`` We must go into that garden and see it ,"
said person_1.
`` No , no ,"
said person_0 ; `` it belongs to a bad Raja , Chumman Basa , a very wicked man"
But person_1 insisted on going in , and in spite of all person_0 could say , he got off the horse to look at the flowers.
So she said to person_1 , `` Come , come , let us go ; do not go near that bad man.
I see in his eyes , and I feel in my heart , that he will kill you to seize me"
`` What nonsense ,"
said person_1.
`` I believe he is a very good Raja.
Anyhow , I am so near to him that I could not get away"
`` Well ,"
person_0 sat quite still on her horse , and as the Raja came towards her she said , `` Why did you kill my husband ?"
`` Because I want to take you ,"
he answered.
`` You can not ,"
said person_0.
`` Yes , I can ,"
said the Raja.
`` Take me , then ,"
said person_0 to Chumman Basa ; so he came quite close and put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse.
Then he got up and saw the Raja 's dead body by person_0 's horse.
`` What 's that ?"
said person_1.
`` That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me , just as I said he would"
`` Who killed him ?"
asked person_1.
`` I did ,"
answered person_0 , `` and it was I who brought you to life"
`` Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so ,"
said person_1.
`` No ,"
said person_0 , `` for he is a wicked man , and will try to do you harm"
`` What will you do ,"
said person_1 , `` if I leave you ? I can not leave you"
`` I will take care of myself ,"
said person_0 ; `` but this man is so wicked , he may kill you again if you are near him"
So person_1 got up on the horse , and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for person_0.
There Prince person_1 told everything to his father , who was horrified and angry.
`` How lucky for you that you have such a wife ,"
he said.
`` Why did you not do what she told you ? But for her , you would be now dead"
Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son 's safety , and gave many , many rupees to the fakirs.
And he made so much of person_0.
He loved her dearly ; he could not do enough for her.
said King Dantal , `` person_0 is so beautiful , that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away"
There was once upon a time a tailor who had three sons , and only one goat.
The sons , therefore , did this , in turn.
Once the eldest took her to the churchyard , where the finest herbs were to be found , and let her eat and run about there.
At night when it was time to go home he asked , `` Goat , hast thou had enough ?"
The goat answered , `` I have eaten so much , Not a leaf more I 'll touch , meh ! meh !"
`` Come home , then ,"
said the youth , and took hold of the cord round her neck , led her into the stable and tied her up securely.
`` Well ,"
said the old tailor , `` has the goat had as much food as she ought ?"
`` Oh ,"
answered the son , `` she has eaten so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch"
But the father wished to satisfy himself , and went down to the stable , stroked the dear animal and asked , `` Goat , art thou satisfied ?"
`` What do I hear ?"
and in his anger he took the yard-measure from the wall , and drove him out with blows.
At night when he wanted to go home , he asked , `` Goat , art thou satisfied ?"
The goat answered , `` I have eaten so much , Not a leaf more I 'll touch , meh ! meh !"
`` Come home , then ,"
said the youth , and led her home , and tied her up in the stable.
`` Well ,"
said the old tailor , `` has the goat had as much food as she ought ?"
`` Oh ,"
answered the son , `` she has eaten so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch"
The tailor would not rely on this , but went down to the stable and said , `` Goat , hast thou had enough ?"
`` The godless wretch !"
cried the tailor , `` to let such a good animal hunger ,"
and he ran up and drove the youth out of doors with the yard-measure.
In the evening when he wanted to go home , he asked , `` Goat , hast thou had enough ?"
The goat answered , `` I have eaten so much , Not a leaf more I 'll touch , meh ! meh !"
`` Come home , then ,"
said the youth , and led her into the stable , and tied her up.
`` Well ,"
said the old tailor , `` has the goat had a proper amount of food ?"
`` She has eaten so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch"
The tailor did not trust to that , but went down and asked , `` Goat , hast thou had enough ?"
`` Oh , the brood of liars !"
cried the tailor , `` each as wicked and forgetful of his duty as the other ! Ye shall no longer make a fool of me ,"
and quite beside himself with anger , he ran upstairs and belabored the poor young fellow so vigorously with the yard-measure that he sprang out of the house.
The old tailor was now alone with his goat.
He took her by the rope and conducted her to green hedges , and amongst milfoil , and whatever else goats like to eat.
`` There thou mayest for once eat to thy heart 's content ,"
said he to her , and let her browse till evening.
Then he asked , `` Goat , art thou satisfied ?"
She replied , `` I have eaten so much , Not a leaf more I 'll touch , meh ! meh !"
`` Come home , then ,"
said the tailor , and led her into the stable , and tied her fast.
When he was going away , he turned round again and said , `` Well , art thou satisfied for once ?"
When the tailor heard that , he was shocked , and saw clearly that he had driven away his three sons without cause.
`` Wait , thou ungrateful creature ,"
In great haste he ran upstairs , fetched his razor , lathered the goat 's head , and shaved her as clean as the palm of his hand.
The young journeyman thought , `` With this thou hast enough for thy whole life ,"
and then everything appeared that his heart desired.
It came to pass that on his way home , he came one evening to an inn which was filled with guests.
They bade him welcome , and invited him to sit and eat with them , for otherwise he would have difficulty in getting anything.
`` No ,"
answered the joiner , `` I will not take the few bites out of your mouths ; rather than that , you shall be my guests"
`` Fall to , dear friends ,"
And what surprised them the most was that when a dish became empty , a full one instantly took its place of its own accord.
At mid-day he reached his father , who received him with great joy.
`` Well , my dear son , what hast thou learned ?"
said he to him.
`` Father , I have become a joiner"
`` A good trade ,"
replied the old man ; `` but what hast thou brought back with thee from thy apprenticeship ?"
`` Father , the best thing which I have brought back with me is this little table"
`` But it is a table which furnishes itself ,"
replied the son.
Just invite all our relations and friends , they shall refresh and enjoy themselves for once , for the table will give them all they require"
When the company was assembled , he put his table in the middle of the room and said , `` Little table , cover thyself ,"
but the little table did not bestir itself , and remained just as bare as any other table which did not understand language.
Then the poor apprentice became aware that his table had been changed , and was ashamed at having to stand there like a liar.
The relations , however , mocked him , and were forced to go home without having eaten or drunk.
The father brought out his patches again , and went on tailoring , but the son went to a master in the craft.
The second son had gone to a miller and had apprenticed himself to him.
`` To what use is he put , then ?"
asked the young apprentice.
`` He lets gold drop from his mouth ,"
answered the miller.
`` If thou settest him on a cloth and sayest ` Bricklebrit , ' the good animal will drop gold pieces for thee"
`` That is a fine thing ,"
said the apprentice , and thanked the master , and went out into the world.
When he had need of gold , he had only to say `` Bricklebrit"
to his ass , and it rained gold pieces , and he had nothing to do but pick them off the ground.
Wheresoever he went , the best of everything was good enough for him , and the dearer the better , for he had always a full purse.
It came to pass that he came to the same public-house in which his brother 's table had been exchanged.
After dinner the guest asked what he owed.
The host did not see why he should not double the reckoning , and said the apprentice must give two more gold pieces.
He felt in his pocket , but his gold was just at an end.
`` Wait an instant , sir host ,"
said he , `` I will go and fetch some money ;"
but he took the table-cloth with him.
The stranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cried , `` Bricklebrit ,"
and immediately the beast began to let gold pieces fall , so that it fairly rained down money on the ground.
`` Eh , my word ,"
said the host , `` ducats are quickly coined there ! A purse like that is not amiss"
Early next morning the apprentice traveled away with his ass , and thought that he had his gold-ass.
At mid-day he reached his father , who rejoiced to see him again , and gladly took him in.
`` What hast thou made of thyself , my son ?"
asked the old man.
`` A miller ,"
dear father , he answered.
`` What hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels ?"
`` Nothing else but an ass"
`` There are asses enough here ,"
said the father , `` I would rather have had a good goat"
`` Yes ,"
Just summon all our relations hither , and I will make them rich folks"
`` That suits me well ,"
said the tailor , `` for then I shall have no need to torment myself any longer with the needle ,"
and ran out himself and called the relations together.
As soon as they were assembled , the miller bade them make way , spread out his cloth , and brought the ass into the room.
`` Now watch ,"
said he , and cried , `` Bricklebrit ,"
but no gold pieces fell , and it was clear that the animal knew nothing of the art , for every ass does not attain such perfection.
The third brother had apprenticed himself to a turner , and as that is skilled labor , he was the longest in learning.
`` I can put on the sack ,"
said he , `` and it may be of good service to me , but why should the cudgel be in it ? It only makes it heavy"
`` I will tell thee why ,"
In the evening the young turner reached the inn where his brothers had been cheated.
He laid his sack on the table before him , and began to talk of all the wonderful things which he had seen in the world.
`` Yes ,"
The inn-keeper pricked up his ears , `` What in the world can that be ?"
thought he ; `` the sack must be filled with nothing but jewels ; I ought to get them cheap too , for all good things go in threes"
When it was time for sleep , the guest stretched himself on the bench , and laid his sack beneath him for a pillow.
Instantly the little cudgel came forth , and fell on the inn-keeper and gave him a sound thrashing.
Then the turner said , `` If thou dost not give back the table which covers itself , and the gold-ass , the dance shall begin afresh"
`` Oh , no ,"
cried the host , quite humbly , `` I will gladly produce everything , only make the accursed kobold creep back into the sack"
Then said the apprentice , `` I will let mercy take the place of justice , but beware of getting into mischief again !"
So he cried , `` Into the sack , Cudgel !"
and let him have rest.
Next morning the turner went home to his father with the wishing-table , and the gold-ass.
The tailor rejoiced when he saw him once more , and asked him likewise what he had learned in foreign parts.
`` Dear father ,"
said he , `` I have become a turner"
`` A skilled trade ,"
said the father.
`` What hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels ?"
`` A precious thing , dear father ,"
replied the son , `` a cudgel in the sack"
`` What !"
cried the father , `` a cudgel ! That 's worth thy trouble , indeed ! From every tree thou can cut thyself one"
`` But not one like this , dear father.
Look you , with this cudgel have I got back the wishing-table and the gold-ass which the thievish inn-keeper took away from my brothers.
Now let them both be sent for , and invite all our kinsmen.
I will give them to eat and to drink , and will fill their pockets with gold into the bargain"
The old tailor would not quite believe , but nevertheless got the relatives together.
The miller said , `` Bricklebrit ,"
-LRB- I can see in thy face that thou also wouldst like to be there.
-RRB- Then the turner brought the little table , and said , `` Now dear brother , speak to it"
And scarcely had the carpenter said , `` Table , cover thyself ,"
than it was spread and amply covered with the most exquisite dishes.
The tailor locked away needle and thread , yard-measure and goose , in a press , and lived with his three sons in joy and splendor.
She was ashamed that she had a bald head , and ran to a fox 's hole and crept into it.
When the fox came home , he was met by two great eyes shining out of the darkness , and was terrified and ran away.
`` Ah ,"
answered Redskin , `` a fierce beast is in my cave and stared at me with its fiery eyes"
`` We will soon drive him out ,"
`` It is all very well for thee to talk ,"
replied the bear , `` a furious beast with staring eyes is in Redskin 's house , and we ca n't drive him out"
and ran forth into the world as if mad , and to this hour no one knows where she has gone.
-RRB-"
`` I want to be something !"
said the eldest of five brothers.
`` I want to do something in the world.
I do n't care how humble my position may be in society , if I only effect some good , for that will really be something.
I 'll make bricks , for they are quite indispensable things , and then I shall truly have done something"
`` But that _ something _ will not be enough !"
quoth the second brother.
`` What you intend doing is just as much as nothing at all.
It is journeyman 's work , and can be done by a machine.
No , I would rather be a bricklayer at once , for that _ is _ something real ; and that 's what I will be.
Yes , and if all goes well , I will keep journeymen.
I shall become a master bricklayer , and my wife will be a master 's wife -- that is what _ I _ call something"
`` That 's nothing at all !"
said the third.
`` That is beyond the pale of the guild , and there are many of those in a town that stand far above the mere master artizan.
You may be an honest man ; but as a ` master ' you will after all only belong to those who are ranked among common men.
I know something better than that.
I will be an architect , and will thus enter into the territory of art and speculation.
I shall be reckoned among those who stand high in point of intellect.
I shall go to the academy , and get instructions in drawing , and shall be called an architect.
That will always be a thing to remember , and that 's what I call something !"
`` But I do n't care at all for _ that _ something ,"
said the fourth"
_ I _ wo n't sail in the wake of others , and be a copyist.
I will be a genius ; and will stand up greater than all the rest of you together.
`` But supposing the climate and the material are bad ,"
I quite realize the fact that none of you will be anything real , however much you may believe in yourselves.
But , do what you like , I will not resemble you : I shall keep on the outside of things , and criticise whatever you produce.
But what became of the five brothers ? Why , this is _ nothing _ , and not _ something _.
Listen , it is a capital story.
You see that is what comes of bricks.
Some of those belonging to the eldest brother certainly crumbled away , or broke in two , but there was a use even for these.
On the high rampart , the wall that kept out the sea , Margaret , the poor woman , wished to build herself a little house.
The poor woman put together the house for herself.
It was little and narrow , and the single window was quite crooked.
The door was too low , and the thatched roof might have shown better workmanship.
The second brother knew better how to build a wall , for he had served an apprenticeship to it.
And he carried his idea into effect.
When he had come home and become a master , he built one house after another in the town.
It was a pretty house , and in it lived a happy pair.
_ That _ was something , and _ he _ was something ; and he had a long title before and after his name.
His children were called _ genteel _ children , and when he died his widow was `` a widow of rank ,"
But the top storey tumbled down , and he came tumbling down with it , and broke his neck.
It was only one storey high , but still it was _ something _.
The people always said he had a good head of his own.
At last his hour came , and he died , and came to the gates of Paradise.
`` I suppose this is done for the sake of contrast , that I and this wretched soul should arrive here at exactly the same time !"
said the critic.
`` Pray who are you , my good woman ?"
he asked.
`` Do you want to get in here too ?"
And the old woman curtsied as well as she could : she thought it must be St.
Peter himself talking to her.
`` I 'm a poor old woman of a very humble family ,"
she replied.
`` I 'm old Margaret that lived in the house on the sea wall"
`` Well , and what have you done ? what have you accomplished down there ?"
`` I have really accomplished nothing at all in the world : nothing that I can plead to have the doors here opened to me.
It would be a real mercy to allow me to slip in through the gate"
`` In what manner did you leave the world ?"
asked he , just for the sake of saying something ; for it was wearisome work standing there and saying nothing.
`` Why , I really do n't know how I left it.
It was a hard winter , but I have got out of it all now.
For a few days the weather was quite calm , but very cold , as your honor must very well know.
The sea was covered with ice as far as one could look.
All the people from the town walked out upon the ice , and I think they said there was a dance there , and skating.
There was beautiful music and a great feast there too ; the sound came into my poor little room , where I lay ill.
.
I knew it , and a shuddering came upon me.
I crept out of bed , and got to the window , but could not crawl farther , I was so exhausted.
But I managed to open the window.
I saw the people outside running and jumping about on the ice ; I could see the beautiful flags that waved in the wind.
I heard the boys shouting ` hurrah ! ' and the servant men and maids singing.
There were all kinds of merriment going on.
Soon the storm would burst , and the ice would break , and all who were upon it would be lost without remedy.
They could not hear me , and I could not come out to them.
I succeeded in lighting up a beacon for them.
The flames rushed out towards me , flickered through the window , and rose high above the roof.
Not one remained behind.
Then the gates of heaven were opened , and the angel led the old woman in.
`` Look , this is what the poor woman brought ,"
said the angel to the critic.
`` What dost _ thou _ bring ? I know that thou hast accomplished nothing -- thou hast not made so much as a single brick.
But thou canst not go back , and I can do nothing for thee !"
Then the poor soul , the old dame who had lived on the dyke , put in a petition for him.
Could not all those bricks and pieces be counted as a single brick in his favor ? It was an act of mercy.
He wants it now ; and is not this the very fountain of mercy ?"
Thou shalt not be turned away.
`` I could have said that in better words !"
thought the critic , but he did not find fault aloud ; and for him , after all , that was"
A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees , and bade him go to another country and try his luck in trade.
The son took the money and departed.
He had not gone far before he came across some herdsmen quarrelling over a dog , that some of them wished to kill.
`` Please do not kill the dog ,"
pleaded the young and tender-hearted fellow ; `` I will give you one hundred rupees for it"
Then and there , of course , the bargain was concluded , and the foolish fellow took the dog , and continued his journey.
He next met with some people fighting about a cat.
Some of them wanted to kill it , but others not.
`` Oh ! please do not kill it ,"
said he ; `` I will give you one hundred rupees for it"
Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money.
He went on till he reached a village , where some folk were quarrelling over a snake that had just been caught.
Some of them wished to kill it , but others did not.
`` Please do not kill the snake ,"
said he ; `` I will give you one hundred rupees"
Of course the people agreed , and were highly delighted.
`` You fool ! You scamp !"
exclaimed his father when he had heard how his son had wasted all the money that had been given to him.
`` Go and live in the stables and repent of your folly.
You shall never again enter my house"
So the young man went and lived in the stables.
One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master , `` I am the son of Raja Indrasha.
I do not know how I shall ever be able to repay you for your great kindness to me.
Would that you knew my father ! How glad he would be to see his son 's preserver !"
`` Where does he live ? I should like to see him , if possible ,"
said the young man.
`` Well said !"
continued the snake.
`` Do you see yonder mountain ? At the bottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring.
If you will come with me and dive into that spring , we shall both reach my father 's country.
Oh ! how glad he will be to see you ! He will wish to reward you , too.
But how can he do that ? However , you may be pleased to accept something at his hand.
Attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and prepared to jump in , according to the snake 's directions.
`` O master !"
exclaimed the cat and dog , when they saw what he was going to do.
`` What shall we do ? Where shall we go ?"
`` Wait for me here ,"
he replied.
`` I am not going far.
I shall not be long away"
On saying this , he dived into the water and was lost to sight.
`` Now what shall we do ?"
said the dog to the cat.
`` We must remain here ,"
replied the cat , `` as our master ordered.
Do not be anxious about food.
I will go to the people 's houses and get plenty of food for both of us"
And so the cat did , and they both lived very comfortably till their master came again and joined them.
The young man and the snake reached their destination in safety ; and information of their arrival was sent to the Raja.
His highness commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him.
Then the Raja went and embraced his son , and saluting the stranger welcomed him to his dominions.
He then returned.
On reaching the top of the spring he found his friends , the dog and the cat , waiting for him.
They told one another all they had experienced since they had last seen each other , and were all very glad.
Afterwards they walked together to the river side , where it was decided to try the powers of the charmed ring and pot and spoon.
The merchant 's son spoke to the ring , and immediately a beautiful house and a lovely princess with golden hair appeared.
He spoke to the pot and spoon , also , and the most delicious dishes of food were provided for them.
On finding it the prince rushed off to the palace , locked himself up in his room , and would not leave it.
The king , his father , was in great distress about the matter , and did not know what to do.
He feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir.
At last he determined to seek the counsel of his aunt , who was an ogress.
She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing , and buzzing , and buzzing.
She also embraced and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words.
The beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived.
Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband for the ring , and he readily gave it to her.
The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious thing.
`` Rise up.
Be glad.
Mourn no more ,"
she said to him.
`` The woman for whom you yearn will appear at your summons.
See , here is the charm , whereby you may bring her before you"
He at once entered the building , and telling the beautiful princess of his intense love , entreated her to be his wife.
Seeing no escape from the difficulty , she consented on the condition that he would wait one month for her.
Meanwhile the merchant 's son had returned from hunting and was terribly distressed not to find his house and wife.
There was the place only , just as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring which Raja Indrasha had given him.
He sat down and determined to put an end to himself.
Presently the cat and dog came up.
They had gone away and hidden themselves , when they saw the house and everything disappear.
`` O master !"
they said , `` stay your hand.
Your trial is great , but it can be remedied.
Give us one month , and we will go and try to recover your wife and house"
`` Go ,"
said he , `` and may the great God aid your efforts.
Bring back my wife , and I shall live"
`` We may have some difficulty here ,"
said the cat.
`` Look , the king has taken our master 's wife and house for himself.
You stay here.
I will go to the house and try to see her"
So the dog sat down , and the cat climbed up to the window of the room , wherein the beautiful princess was sitting , and entered.
The princess recognized the cat , and informed it of all that had happened to her since she had left them.
`` But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people ?"
she asked.
`` Yes ,"
replied the cat , `` if you can tell me where the charmed ring is"
`` The ring is in the stomach of the ogress ,"
she said.
`` All right ,"
said the cat , `` I will recover it.
If we once get it , everything is ours"
Then the cat descended the wall of the house , and went and laid down by a rat 's hole and pretended she was dead.
The eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married.
The cat got to know of this , and at once conceived the idea of seizing the bridegroom and making him render the necessary help.
`` Oh ! let me go , let me go ,"
cried the terrified rat.
`` Oh ! let him go ,"
squealed all the company.
`` It is his wedding day"
`` No , no ,"
replied the cat.
`` Not unless you do some thing for me.
Listen.
The ogress , who lives in that house with the prince and his wife , has swallowed a ring , which I very much want.
If you will procure it for me , I will allow the rat to depart unharmed.
If you do not , then your prince dies under my feet"
`` Very well , we agree ,"
said they all.
`` Nay , if we do not get the ring for you , devour us all"
This was rather a bold offer.
However , they accomplished the thing.
As soon as the cat received the ring , she started back with the dog to go and tell their master the good tidings.
All seemed safe now.
`` How glad master will be !"
they thought , and ran as fast as their legs could carry them.
Now , on the way they had to cross a stream.
The dog swam , and the cat sat on its back.
Sorry moment , for the dog at once dropped it , and a fish swallowed it.
`` Oh ! what shall I do ? what shall I do ?"
said the dog.
`` What is done is done ,"
replied the cat.
`` We must try to recover it , and if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream.
I have a plan.
You go and kill a small lamb , and bring it here to me"
`` All right ,"
said the dog , and at once ran off.
He soon came back with a dead lamb , and gave it to the cat.
The cat got inside the lamb and lay down , telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet.
On this the cat came out and jumped on to the bird , and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring.
The king of the fishes did so , and the ring was found and carried back to the cat.
`` Come along now ; I have got the ring ,"
said the cat to the dog.
`` No , I will not ,"
said the dog , `` unless you let me have the ring.
I can carry it as well as you.
Let me have it or I will kill you"
So the cat was obliged to give up the ring.
The careless dog very soon dropped it again.
This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite.
`` See , see , there it goes -- away to that big tree ,"
the cat exclaimed.
`` Oh ! oh ! what have I done ?"
cried the dog.
`` You foolish thing , I knew it would be so ,"
said the cat.
`` But stop your barking , or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we shall not be able to trace it"
The cat waited till it was quite dark , and then climbed the tree , killed the kite , and recovered the ring.
`` Come along ,"
it said to the dog when it reached the ground.
`` We must make haste now.
We have been delayed.
Our master will die from grief and suspense.
Come on"
The dog , now thoroughly ashamed of itself , begged the cat 's pardon for all the trouble it had given.
It was afraid to ask for the ring the third time , so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and gave him the precious charm.
In a moment his sorrow was turned into joy.
He spoke to the ring , and his beautiful wife and house reappeared , and he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be"
He was young in those days , and indeed he is young yet , though he is ten years older than he was then.
After his return he visited one of the little provincial towns on the island of Seeland.
It was quite an event , and all the town knew of it without its being announced by beat of drum.
There was quite an air of festivity about , and in the house was festivity also , for Mr.
person_0 the sculptor was there.
person_0 was concerned , like a fresh piece of blotting paper , that absorbed all that was spoken , and asked for more.
She was very appreciative , and incredibly ignorant -- a kind of female Caspar Hauser.
`` I should like to see Rome ,"
she said.
`` It must be a lovely city , with all the strangers who are continually arriving there.
Now , do give us a description of Rome.
How does the city look when you come in by the gate ?"
`` I can not very well describe it ,"
replied the sculptor.
`` A great open place , and in the midst of it an obelisk , which is a thousand years old"
`` An organist !"
exclaimed the lady , who had never met with the word _ obelisk _.
`` Has the Pope a large family ?"
asked the lady.
And the young man considerately answered , as if the question had been better put , `` No , he does not come of a great family"
`` That 's not what I mean ,"
the widow persisted.
`` I mean , has he a wife and children ?"
`` The Pope is not allowed to marry ,"
said the gentleman.
`` I do n't like that ,"
was the lady 's comment.
sighed a few of the guests.
`` Oh , to travel !"
sighed others.
`` Charming , charming !"
chorused they all.
`` Yes , if I win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery ,"
said the head tax-collector 's lady , `` then we will travel.
I and my daughter , and you , Mr.
person_0 ; you must be our guide.
We 'll all three travel together , and one or two good friends more"
And the daughter sighed very quietly.
And how much may lie in one little sigh , or be placed in it ! The young man placed a great deal in it.
The house of the head tax-collector 's widow was the one which Mr.
They called her person_1.
Her name was really Calen Malena , and these two names had been contracted into the one name , person_1.
She was beautiful ; but a few said she was rather dull , and probably slept late of a morning.
`` She has been always accustomed to that ,"
her mother said.
`` She 's a beauty , and they always are easily tired.
She sleeps rather late , but that makes her eyes so clear"
What a power lay in the depths of these dark blue eyes ! `` Still waters run deep"
The young man felt the truth of this proverb ; and his heart had sunk into the depths.
He spoke and told his adventures , and the mamma was as simple and eager in her questioning as on the first evening of their meeting.
It was a pleasure to hear person_0 describe anything.
He spoke of Naples , of excursions to Mount Vesuvius , and showed colored prints of several of the eruptions.
And the head tax-collector 's widow had never heard of them before , or taken time to consider the question.
`` Good heavens !"
she exclaimed.
`` So that is a burning mountain ! But is it not dangerous to the people round about ?"
`` Whole cities have been destroyed ,"
he answered ; `` for instance , Pompeii and Herculaneum"
`` But the poor people ! -- And you saw all that with your own eyes ?"
After all , it was of no consequence , for person_1 's mamma had the best of all things -- namely , person_1 herself.
And person_0 and person_1 were betrothed , which was natural enough , and the betrothal was announced in the little newspaper of the town.
Mamma purchased thirty copies of the paper , that she might cut out the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances.
And the betrothed pair were happy , and the mother-in-law elect was happy too ; for it seemed like connecting herself with Thorwaldsen.
`` For you are a continuation of Thorwaldsen ,"
she said to person_0.
And it seemed to person_0 that mamma had in this instance said a clever thing.
person_0 undertook to take a bust of person_1 and of his mother-in-law.
They sat to him accordingly , and saw how he moulded and smoothed the soft clay with his fingers.
`` I suppose it 's only on our account ,"
said mamma-in-law , `` that you undertake this commonplace work , and do n't leave your servant to do all that sticking together"
`` It is highly necessary that I should mould the clay myself ,"
he replied.
`` Ah , yes , you are so very polite ,"
retorted mamma ; and person_1 silently pressed his hand , still soiled by the clay.
person_1 stood silent , and nodded approbation of the expressed thought , while mamma-in-law made the following confession : `` It 's difficult to follow all that.
But I manage to hobble after you with my thoughts , though they whirl round and round , but I contrive to hold them fast"
And person_1 's beauty held person_0 fast , filled his soul , and seized and mastered him.
Such was the betrothal ; and now came the wedding , with bridesmaids and wedding presents , all duly mentioned in the wedding speech.
Songs were sung and cheers were given , for it was a gay wedding , and they were a handsome pair.
`` Pygmalion received his Galatea ,"
so one of the songs said.

aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Ah , that 's your mythologies ,"
said mamma-in-law.
Next day the youthful pair started for Copenhagen , where they were to live.
Mamma-in-law accompanied them , `` to take care of the commonplace ,"
as she said , meaning the domestic economy.
person_1 was like a doll in a doll 's house , all was so bright , so new , and so fine.
The magic of form had enchanted him.
It was a mental relief when Sophy , one of her friends , came to pay a visit.
Sophy was not pretty.
She was a very sensible girl , and it never occurred to her that she might become at all dangerous here.
Her appearance was like a pleasant breath of air in the doll 's house ; and air was certainly required here , as they all acknowledged.
They felt they wanted airing , and consequently they came out into the air , and mamma-in-law and the young couple traveled to Italy.
`` Thank Heaven that we are in our own four walls again ,"
was the exclamation of mother and daughter when they came home , a year after.
`` There 's no pleasure in traveling ,"
said mamma-in-law.
`` To tell the truth , it 's very wearisome -- I beg pardon for saying so.
I got tired at last of those endless Madonnas ; one seemed to be turning a Madonna oneself !"
`` And what bad living you get !"
said person_1.
`` Yes ,"
replied mamma , `` no such thing as an honest meat soup.
It 's miserable trash , their cookery"
And the traveling fatigued person_1 : she was always fatigued , that was the worst of it.
Sophy was taken into the house , where her presence was a real advantage.
Where the case is everything , the case should be strong , or else all is over.
And all _ was _ over with the case -- person_1 died.
`` She was beautiful ,"
said mamma , `` she was quite different from the antiques , for they are so damaged.
A beauty ought to be perfect , and person_1 was a perfect beauty"
person_0 wept , and mamma wept , and both of them wore mourning.
The black dress suited mamma very well , and she wore mourning the longest.
Moreover , she had to experience another grief in seeing person_0 marry again -- marry Sophy , who had no appearance at all.
`` He 's gone to the very extreme ,"
cried mamma-in-law ; `` he has gone from the most beautiful to the ugliest , and he has forgotten his first wife.
Men have no endurance.
My husband was of a different stamp , and he died before me"
`` Pygmalion received his Galatea ,"
said person_0 : `` yes , that 's what they said in the wedding song.
You came , Sophy , not in the glory of outward beauty , though you are fair , fairer than is needful.
The chief thing remains the chief.
Poor person_1 ! ours was but wayfarers ' life.
Yonder , where we shall know each other by sympathy , we shall be half strangers"
`` That was not lovingly spoken ,"
said Sophy , `` not spoken like a Christian.
In the winter time , when deep snow lay on the ground , a poor boy was forced to go out on a sledge to fetch wood.
So he scraped away the snow , and as he was thus clearing the ground , he found a tiny , gold key.
Hereupon he thought that where the key was , the lock must be also , and dug in the ground and found an iron chest.
`` If the key does but fit it !"
thought he ; `` no doubt there are precious things in that little box"
He searched , but no keyhole was there.
At last he discovered one , but so small that it was hardly visible.
He tried it , and the key fitted it exactly.

But the guardian-angel which every good child has , did not forsake her , but always brought her into the right path again.
Once , however , the guardian-angel behaved as if he were not there , and the child could not find her way out of the forest again.
She knocked , the door opened , and she came to a second door , where she knocked again.
An old man , who had a snow-white beard and looked venerable , opened it for her ; and he was no other than person_0.

Next morning when she awoke , she wanted to say good morning to person_0.
Joseph , but she did not see him.
The next day , the second child also took a fancy to go into the forest.
Her mother gave her a much larger piece of pancake and bread.
It happened with her just as with the first child.
In the evening she came to person_0.
Joseph 's little hut , who gave her roots for a thick soup.
When it was ready , he likewise said to her , `` I am so hungry , give me some of thy food"
Then the child said , `` You may have your share"

Joseph took her in his arms and put her in the bed , and laid himself on the straw.
In the morning when the child awoke and looked for person_0.
So she took the little bag and ran home with it , and took it to her mother , but she secretly kept two pieces for herself.
The eldest daughter had by this time grown curious , and the next morning also insisted on going out into the forest.
Her mother gave her pancakes with her -- as many as she wanted , and bread and cheese as well.
In the evening she found person_0.
Joseph in his little hut , just as the two others had found him.
When the soup was ready and person_0.
Joseph said , `` I am so hungry , give me some of thy food ,"
the girl answered , `` Wait until I am satisfied ; then if there is anything left thou shalt have it"
She ate , however , nearly the whole of it , and person_0.
Joseph had to scrape the dish.
Afterwards , the good old man offered her his bed , and wanted to lie on the straw.
She took it without making any opposition , laid herself down in the little bed , and left the hard straw to the white-haired man.
Next morning when she awoke , person_0.
Joseph was not to be found , but she did not trouble herself about that.
She looked behind the door for a money-bag.
Then she ran out and screamed without stopping till she met person_0.
When she got home , her mother was standing before the door , and asked , `` What hast thou had given to thee ?"
Then she lied and said , `` A great bag of money , but I have lost it on the way"
`` Lost it !"
cried the mother , `` oh , but we will soon find it again ,"
and took her by the hand , and wanted to seek it with her.
At first she began to cry , and did not wish to go , but at last she went.
On the way , however , so many lizards and snakes broke loose on both of them , that they did not know how to save themselves.
At last they stung the wicked child to death , and they stung the mother in the foot , because she had not brought her up better.
She prayed to God daily that he would grant that all her sons might be on the earth with the Redeemer who was promised.
When her necessity became still greater she sent one of them after the other out into the world to seek bread for her.
At length he became so weak that he was forced to lie down , and he believed death to be at hand.
Suddenly there stood beside him a small boy who shone with brightness , and was as beautiful and kind as an angel.
The child smote his little hands together , until Peter was forced to look up and saw him.
Then the child said , `` Why art thou sitting there in such trouble ?"
`` Alas !"
The child said , `` Come with me , and thy wish shall be fulfilled"
He took poor Peter by the hand , and led him between some cliffs to a great cavern.
Then said the little angel , `` Lie down in the first , and sleep a while , I will rock thee"
Peter did so , and the angel sang to him and rocked him until he was al seep.
They slept , however , three hundred years , until the night when the Saviour of the world was born.
Then they awoke , and were with him on earth , and were called the twelve apostles.
Legend 3 The Rose There was once a poor woman who had two children.
The youngest had to go every day into the forest to fetch wood.
The child told her mother this , but at first she would not believe it.
The mother put the rose in water.
On the same morning , the rose was in full bloom.
The man answered , `` By poverty and humility.
He took nothing but a little food , said nothing , but prayed to the Lord to take him into his heaven.
When the seven years were over , he returned to his father 's palace , but no one recognized him.
He said to the servants , `` Go and tell my parents that I have come back again"
But the servants did not believe it , and laughed and left him standing there.
Then said he , `` Go and tell it to my brothers that they may come down , for I should so like to see them again"
Then he wrote a letter to his mother , and described to her all his misery , but he did not say that he was her son.
So , out of pity , the Queen had a place under the stairs assigned to him , and food taken to him daily by two servants.
But one of them was ill-natured and said , `` Why should the beggar have the good food ?"
As , however , his illness increased , he desired to receive the last sacrament.
When the host was being elevated down below , all the bells in the town and neighborhood began to ring.
After mass the priest went to the poor man under the stairs , and there he lay dead.
In one hand he had a rose , in the other a lily , and beside him was a paper in which was written his history.
When he was buried , a rose grew on one side of his grave , and a lily on the other.
The very rich sister was as hard as a stone , and said , `` I myself have nothing in the house ,"
and drove away the poor creature with harsh words.
When the woman saw that she was terrified and told him what had occurred.
He hurried away to help the widow and her children , but when he entered her room , he found her praying.
She had her two youngest children in her arms , and the three eldest were lying dead.
He offered her food , but she answered , `` For earthly food have we no longer any desire.
God has already satisfied the hunger of three of us , and he will hearken to our supplications likewise"
Scarcely had she uttered these words than the two little ones drew their last breath , whereupon her heart broke , and she sank down dead.
He said carelessly to himself , `` There , that one is getting his deserts !"
Then he neither ate nor drank , threw himself down on the ground , and prayed day and night.
He alone sits in judgement.
However , if thou wilt do penance and repent thy sins , he will forgive thee"
Thou shalt beg thy bread from door to door , and not tarry more than one night in the same house.
That is the penance which the Lord lays on thee"
Then the hermit took the piece of wood , and went back into the world , which he had not seen for so long.
Then said he , `` Good woman , keep me with you in your house for this night ;"
The hermit said , `` Let me stay , they will do no injury either to you or to me"
and the woman was compassionate , and let herself be persuaded.
Then the man lay down beneath the stairs , and put the bit of wood under his head.
At midnight the robbers came home and blustered and stormed.
Then said the mother , `` Let him alone , it is a poor sinner who is expiating his crime"
The robbers asked , `` What has he done ?"
`` Old man ,"
cried they , `` tell us thy sins"
The hermit , after he had converted the three sinners , lay down to sleep again under the stairs.
Thus the Lord had once more received him into his favor.
`` Willingly ,"
answered the waggoner , `` but I have no glass in which I can give thee the wine"
The little flower is still always called Our Lady 's Little Glass.
She was still sitting lost in thought , when all at once she heard the bells ringing for early prayer.
She was surprised that she had thus in her sorrow watched through the whole night , and lighted her lantern and went to church.
It was already lighted up when she arrived , but not as it usually was with wax candles , but with a dim light.
They neither spoke nor sang ; but a soft humming and whispering was heard all over the church.
The old woman looked there , and saw her two children , one hanging on the gallows , the other bound to the wheel.
So he set out , and walked continually straight onwards over hill and valley without ever turning aside.
Now when he beheld all the magnificence of this , he thought he had reached heaven , sat down , and rejoiced with his whole heart.
The priest said , `` If he believes that , we will leave him inside"
So he went to him , and asked if he had any inclination to work.
`` Yes ,"
the little fellow replied , `` I am accustomed to work , but I will not go out of heaven again"
From this time forth , he every day took half his dinner to the image , and the image began to enjoy the food.
When a few weeks had gone by , people remarked that the image was growing larger and stout and strong , and wondered much.
Then the image answered him and said , `` I have seen thy good-will , and that is enough for me.
Next Sunday thou shalt go with me to the wedding"
`` No ,"
answered the image , `` thou alone"
Legend 10 The Hazel-Branch One afternoon the Christ-child had laid himself in his cradle-bed and had fallen asleep.
She was alarmed , left the strawberries where they were , and hastened away.
The adder darted after her ; but Our Lady , as you can readily understand , knew what it was best to do.
She hid herself behind a hazel-bush , and stood there until the adder had crept away again.
Therefore , from the most remote times , a green hazel-branch has been the safest protection against adders , snakes , and everything else which creeps on the earth"
Once upon a time there lived a King who had seven Queens , but no children.
This was a great grief to him , especially when he remembered that on his death there would be no heir to inherit the kingdom.
So quickly did it pass that he scarcely saw it ; nevertheless a burning desire to capture and possess the beautiful strange creature filled his breast.
Forgetful of all else , the King , setting spurs to his horse , followed at full speed.
It was a handsome boy , but the other Queens were very jealous that the youngest amongst them should be so fortunate.
Through this he disappeared , returning in an hour or so laden with sweet-meats , which he divided equally amongst the seven blind Queens.
As he grew older he enlarged the hole , and slipped out two or three times every day to play with the little nobles in the town.
At last , when he was quite a big lad , he one day took his bow and arrow , and went out to seek for game.
It came tumbling past the very window where the white Queen was sitting ; she rose to see what was the matter , and looked out.
At the first glance of the handsome young lad standing there bow in hand , she knew by witchcraft that it was the King 's son.
`` No ,"
`` Poor souls !"
Hearing this , the lad was delighted beyond measure , and gave up the pigeon at once.
Whereupon the white Queen told him to seek her mother without delay , and ask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace.
`` She will not fail to give them ,"
said the cruel Queen , `` if you show her this token on which I have written what I want done"
Never were such rejoicings as these few words produced.
When the beautiful bride heard his story , she asked to see the potsherd , for she was very learned and clever.
and returned it to the son of seven Queens , who , none the wiser , set off on his quest.
Nevertheless she took it off , and gave it him , saying , `` There are only thirteen of 'em now , for I lost one last week"
Drawing his bow , he shot one , and it came fluttering past the window.
The white hind looked out , and lo ! there was the King 's son alive and well.
Then the lad did as he had been told bravely.
He journeyed on and on till he came to a milk-white pond , guarded by the eighteen thousand demons.
The Jogi , seeing the lad , called out fiercely , `` What do you want here ?"
One fell dead just beneath the window where the white Queen was sitting.
Looking out , she saw the lad hale and hearty standing before her , and grew whiter than ever with rage and spite.
Kill the lad , and sprinkle his blood like water !"
; so she set off to see what had happened.
`` Do n't you disobey orders again !"
grumbled the old hag , `` or next time I 'll leave you alone.
Now be off , before I repent of my kindness !"
Then , when all was prepared , she bade her husband give a grand feast to the King.
There was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the hearth and poked the fire , and his wife sat and span.
`` Yes ,"
Then said they , `` It is as we wished it to be , and it shall be our dear child ;"
and because of its size , they called it Thumbling.
`` Oh father ,"
cried Thumbling , `` I will soon bring the cart , rely on that ; it shall be in the forest at the appointed time"
The man smiled and said , `` How can that be done , thou art far too small to lead the horse by the reins ?"
`` Well ,"
answered the man , `` for once we will try it"
Then it went quite properly as if with its master , and the cart went the right way into the forest.
It so happened that just as he was turning a corner , and the little one was crying , `` Gee up ,"
two strange men came towards him.
`` My word !"
`` That ca n't be right ,"
said the other , `` we will follow the cart and see where it stops"
The cart , however , drove right into the forest , and exactly to the place where the wood had been cut.
When Thumbling saw his father , he cried to him , `` Seest thou , father , here I am with the cart ; now take me down"
The father got hold of the horse with his left hand and with the right took his little son out of the ear.
Thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw , but when the two strange men saw him , they did not know what to say for astonishment.
We will buy him"
They went to the peasant and said , `` Sell us the little man.
He shall be well treated with us"
`` No ,"
replied the father , `` he is the apple of my eye , and all the money in the world can not buy him from me"
Then the father parted with him to the two men for a handsome bit of money.
`` Where wilt thou sit ?"
they said to him.
They did as he wished , and when Thumbling had taken leave of his father , they went away with him.
They walked until it was dusk , and then the little fellow said , `` Do take me down , I want to come down"
`` Good evening , gentlemen , just go home without me ,"
he cried to them , and mocked them.
They ran thither and stuck their sticks into the mouse-hole , but it was all lost labor.
Thumbling crept still farther in , and as it soon became quite dark , they were forced to go home with their vexation and their empty purses.
When Thumbling saw that they were gone , he crept back out of the subterranean passage.
`` It is so dangerous to walk on the ground in the dark ,"
said he ; `` how easily a neck or a leg is broken !"
Fortunately he knocked against an empty snail-shell.
`` Thank God !"
said he.
`` In that I can pass the night in safety ,"
and got into it.
`` I could tell thee that ,"
cried Thumbling , interrupting them.
`` What was that ?"
said one of the thieves in fright , `` I heard some one speaking"
They stood still listening , and Thumbling spoke again , and said , `` Take me with you , and I 'll help you"
`` But where art thou ?"
`` Just look on the ground , and observe from whence my voice comes ,"
he replied.
There the thieves at length found him , and lifted him up.
`` Thou little imp , how wilt thou help us ?"
they said.
`` A great deal ,"
said he , `` I will creep into the pastor 's room through the iron bars , and will reach out to you whatever you want to have"
`` Come then ,"
they said , `` and we will see what thou canst do"
The thieves were alarmed , and said , `` But do speak softly , so as not to waken any one !"
The cook , who slept in the next room , heard this and sat up in bed , and listened.
They came back and whispered to him , `` Come , be serious , and reach something out to us"
Then Thumbling again cried as loudly as he could , `` I really will give you everything , just put your hands in"
The maid who was listening , heard this quite distinctly , and jumped out of bed and rushed to the door.
But he had other things to go through.
Truly , there is much affliction and misery in this world ! When day dawned , the maid arose from her bed to feed the cows.
`` Ah , heavens !"
cried he , `` how have I got into the fulling mill ?"
but he soon discovered where he was.
`` In this little room the windows are forgotten ,"
said he , `` and no sun shines in , neither will a candle be brought"
Then at length in his anguish , he cried as loud as he could , `` Bring me no more fodder , bring me no more fodder"
She ran in great haste to her master , and said , `` Oh heavens , pastor , the cow has been speaking !"
`` Thou art mad ,"
replied the pastor ; but he went himself to the byre to see what was there.
Hardly , however had he set his foot inside when Thumbling again cried , `` Bring me no more fodder , bring me no more fodder"
Then the pastor himself was alarmed , and thought that an evil spirit had gone into the cow , and ordered her to be killed.
She was killed , but the stomach , in which Thumbling was , was thrown on the midden.
A hungry wolf ran thither , and swallowed the whole stomach at one gulp.
Thumbling did not lose courage.
`` Perhaps ,"
thought he , `` the wolf will listen to what I have got to say ,"
and he called to him from out of his stomach , `` Dear wolf , I know of a magnificent feast for you"
`` Where is it to be had ?"
said the wolf.
and he described to him exactly his father 's house.
`` Wilt thou be quiet ,"
said the wolf , `` thou wilt waken up the people !"
`` Eh , what ,"
replied the little fellow , `` thou hast eaten thy fill , and I will make merry likewise ,"
and began once more to scream with all his strength.
At last his father and mother were aroused by it , and ran to the room and looked in through the opening in the door.
When they saw that a wolf was inside , they ran away , and the husband fetched his axe , and the wife the scythe.
`` Stay behind ,"
said the man , when they entered the room.
`` When I have given him a blow , if he is not killed by it , thou must cut him down and hew his body to pieces"
Then Thumbling heard his parents , voices and cried , `` Dear father , I am here ; I am in the wolf 's body"
Said the father , full of joy , `` Thank God , our dear child has found us again ,"
and bade the woman take away her scythe , that Thumbling might not be hurt with it.
`` Ah ,"
said the father , `` what sorrow we have gone through for thy sake"
`` Yes father , I have gone about the world a great deal.
Thank heaven , I breathe fresh air again !"
`` Where hast thou been , then ?"
`` And we will not sell thee again , no , not for all the riches in the world ,"
said his parents , and they embraced and kissed their dear Thumbling.
They gave him to eat and to drink , and had some new clothes made for him , for his own had been spoiled on his journey"
`` Stop ,"
said he , `` I shall not be content with this.
If I can only meet with the right people , the King will yet have to give me all the treasure of the country"
He said to him , `` Wilt thou be my servant and go with me ?"
`` Yes ,"
he answered , `` but , first , I will take this little bundle of sticks home to my mother ,"
and he took one of the trees , and wrapped it round the five others , lifted the bundle on his back , and carried it away.
Then he returned and went with his master , who said , `` We two ought to be able to get through the world very well ,"
and when they had walked on for a short while they found a huntsman who was kneeling , had shouldered his gun , and was about to fire.
The master said to him , `` Huntsman , what art thou going to shoot ?"
He answered , `` Two miles from here a fly is sitting on the branch of an oak-tree , and I want to shoot its left eye out"
`` Oh , come with me ,"
said the man , `` if we three are together , we certainly ought to be able to get on in the world !"
Then said the man , `` I know not what is driving the windmills , not a breath of air is stirring ,"
`` Good gracious ! what are you doing up there ?"
He answered , `` Two miles from here are seven windmills ; look , I am blowing them till they turn round"
`` Oh , come with me ,"
said the man.
`` If we four are together , we shall carry the whole world before us !"
Then the master said , `` You have arranged things very comfortably to have a rest"
`` I am a runner ,"
`` Oh , go with me.
If we five are together , we shall carry the whole world before us"
Then the master said to him , `` Gracefully , gracefully , do n't stick your cap on one ear , you look just like a tom-fool !"
`` I must not wear it otherwise ,"
`` Oh , come with me ,"
said the master.
`` If we six are together , we can carry the whole world before us"
Then the man presented himself and said , `` I will , however , let my servant run for me"
The King replied , `` Then his life also must be staked , so that his head and thine are both set on the victory"
It was fixed that the one who was first to bring some water from a far distant well was to be the victor.
In a short time he reached the well , filled his pitcher with water , and turned back.
Half-way home , however , he was overcome with fatigue , and set his pitcher down , lay down himself , and fell asleep.
emptied his pitcher , and ran on.
Then said he , `` The King 's daughter shall still not prevail against us ;"
and he loaded his gun , and shot so cleverly , that he shot the horse 's skull away from under the runner 's head without hurting him.
Then the runner awoke , leapt up , and saw that his pitcher was empty , and that the King 's daughter was already far in advance.
`` Behold !"
said he , `` I have not bestirred myself till now , it did not deserve to be called running before"
Then said the King to her , `` I have thought of a way ; do n't be afraid , they shall not come back again"
And he said to them , `` You shall now make merry together , and eat and drink ,"
There was a table in the room covered with delicious food , and the King said to them , `` Go in , and enjoy yourselves"
And when they were inside , he ordered the doors to be shut and bolted.
Then he sent for the cook , and commanded him to make a fire under the room until the iron became red-hot.
`` He shall not succeed , however ,"
said the one with the cap.
`` I will cause a frost to come , before which the fire shall be ashamed , and creep away"
But the cook replied , `` There is heat enough there , just look yourself"
`` Oh , yes , Lord King ,"
he answered , `` give me as much as my servant can carry , and I will not ask for your daughter"
On this the King was satisfied , and the other continued , `` In fourteen days , I will come and fetch it"
Thereupon he summoned together all the tailors in the whole kingdom , and they were to sit for fourteen days and sew a sack.
and he was alarmed and said , `` What a lot of gold he can carry away !"
`` Bring more ,"
cried he , `` these few crumbs do n't fill it"
`` I will examine it no longer ,"
said he , `` but will just take what comes , so long as the sack is but full"
So he took it on his back , and went away with his comrades.
`` What say you ?"
cried the blower , `` that we are prisoners ! Rather than that should happen , all of you shall dance about in the air"
And he closed one nostril , and with the other blew on the two regiments.
Then they were driven away from each other , and carried into the blue sky over all the mountains one here , the other there.
One sergeant cried for mercy ; he had nine wounds , and was a brave fellow who did not deserve ill treatment.
When the King was informed of this he said , `` Let the rascals go.
They have the best of it"
Then the six conveyed the riches home , divided it amongst them , and lived in content until their death"
The emperor 's favorite horse was shod with gold.
It had a golden shoe on each of its feet.
And a beetle came creeping forth.
`` First the great ones ,"
said he , `` and then the little ones ; but greatness is not the only thing that does it"
And so saying , he stretched out his thin legs.
`` And pray what do you want ?"
asked the smith.
`` Golden shoes , to be sure ,"
replied the beetle.
`` Why , you must be out of your senses ,"
cried the smith.
`` Do you want to have golden shoes too ?"
`` Golden shoes ? certainly ,"
replied the beetle.
`` But _ why _ is the horse to have golden shoes ? Do n't you understand that ?"
asked the smith.
`` Understand ? I understand that it is a personal slight offered to myself ,"
cried the beetle.
`` It is done to annoy me , and therefore I am going into the world to seek my fortune"
`` Go along !"
said the smith.
`` You 're a rude fellow !"
`` Is it not beautiful here ?"
asked one of the little lady-birds that flew about , with their delicate wings and their red-and-black shields on their backs.
`` How sweet it is here -- how beautiful it is !"
`` I 'm accustomed to better things ,"
said the beetle.
`` Do you call _ this _ beautiful ? Why , there is not so much as a dung-heap"
Then he went on , under the shadow of a great stack , and found a caterpillar crawling along.
`` How beautiful the world is !"
`` How conceited you are !"
exclaimed the stag-beetle.
To have wings to fly ! why , we can fly now ;"
and he spread his wings and flew away.
`` I do n't want to be annoyed , and yet I am annoyed ,"
he said , as he flew off.
Soon afterwards he fell down upon a great lawn.
For awhile he lay there and feigned slumber ; at last he fell asleep in earnest.
Suddenly a heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds.
The beetle woke up at the noise , and wanted to escape into the earth , but could not.
He therefore remained lying where he was.
When the weather had moderated a little , and the beetle had rubbed the water out of his eyes , he saw something gleaming.
It was linen that had been placed there to bleach.
He managed to make his way up to it , and crept into a fold of the damp linen.
Towards morning he crept forth : he was very much out of temper about the climate.
On the linen two frogs were sitting.
Their bright eyes absolutely gleamed with pleasure.
`` Wonderful weather this !"
one of them cried.
`` How refreshing ! And the linen keeps the water together so beautifully.
My hind legs seem to quiver as if I were going to swim"
`` I should like to know ,"
What delicious dampness ! It is really as if one were lying in a wet ditch.
Whoever does not rejoice in this , certainly does not love his fatherland"
`` Have you been in the emperor 's stable ?"
asked the beetle : `` there the dampness is warm and refreshing.
That 's the climate for me ; but I can not take it with me on my journey.
But the frogs either did not or would not understand him.
`` I never ask a question twice !"
said the beetle , after he had already asked this one three times without receiving any answer.
Here dwelt several families of earwigs ; and these did not require much , only sociality.
`` Our son has engaged himself ,"
said one mother.
`` Dear , innocent boy ! His greatest hope is that he may creep one day into a clergyman 's ear.
It 's very artless and loveable , that ; and being engaged will keep him steady.
What joy for a mother !"
`` Our son ,"
said another mother , `` had scarcely crept out of the egg , when he was already off on his travels.
He 's all life and spirits ; he 'll run his horns off ! What joy that is for a mother ! Is it not so , Mr.
Beetle ?"
for she knew the stranger by his horny coat.
`` You are both quite right ,"
said he ; so they begged him to walk in ; that is to say , to come as far as he could under the bit of pottery.
`` Now , you also see _ my _ little earwig ,"
observed a third mother and a fourth ; `` they are lovely little things , and highly amusing.
They are never ill-behaved , except when they are uncomfortable in their inside ; but , unfortunately , one is very subject to that at their age"
`` Yes , they are always busy about something , the little rogues !"
`` That is quite out in the big world , on the other side of the ditch ,"
answered an earwig.
`` I hope none of my children will go so far , for it would be the death of me"
`` But I shall try to get so far ,"
said the beetle ; and he went off without taking formal leave ; for that is considered the polite thing to do.
And by the ditch he met several friends ; beetles , all of them.
`` Here we live ,"
they said.
`` We are very comfortable here.
Might we ask you to step down into this rich mud ? You must be fatigued after your journey"
`` Certainly ,"
replied the beetle.
`` I have been exposed to the rain , and have had to lie upon linen , and cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me.
I have also pains in one of my wings , from standing in a draught under a fragment of pottery.
It is really quite refreshing to be among one 's companions once more"
`` Perhaps you come from some muck-heap ?"
observed the oldest of them.
`` Indeed , I come from a much higher place ,"
replied the beetle.
`` I came from the emperor 's stable , where I was born with golden shoes on my feet.
I am traveling on a secret embassy.
You must not ask me any questions , for I ca n't betray my secret"
With this the beetle stepped down into the rich mud.
There sat three young maiden beetles ; and they tittered , because they did not know what to say.
`` Not one of them is engaged yet ,"
said their mother ; and the beetle maidens tittered again , this time from embarrassment.
`` I have never seen greater beauties in the royal stables ,"
exclaimed the beetle , who was now resting himself.
`` Do n't spoil my girls ,"
said the mother ; `` and do n't talk to them , please , unless you have serious intentions.
But of course your intentions are serious , and therefore I give you my blessing"
`` Hurrah !"
cried all the other beetles together ; and our friend was engaged.
Immediately after the betrothal came the marriage , for there was no reason for delay.
`` I have allowed myself to be taken in ,"
said our beetle to himself.
`` And now there 's nothing for it but to take _ them _ in , in turn"
So said , so done.
Away he went , and he stayed away all day , and stayed away all night ; and his wife sat there , a forsaken widow.
`` Oh ,"
said the other beetles , `` this fellow whom we received into our family is nothing more than a thorough vagabond.
He has gone away , and has left his wife a burden upon our hands"

aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Well , then , she shall be unmarried again , and sit here among my daughters ,"
said the mother.
`` Fie on the villain who forsook her !"
In the meantime the beetle had been journeying on , and had sailed across the ditch on a cabbage leaf.
In the morning two persons came to the ditch.
`` Allah sees the black beetle in the black stone and in the black rock.
Is not that written in the Koran ?"
Then he translated the beetle 's name into Latin , and enlarged upon the creature 's nature and history.
The second person , an older scholar , voted for carrying him home.
`` Very comfortable it is here ,"
said he.
That was all very charming.
When the beetle woke up , he crept forth and looked around him.
`` This is an incomparable plenty of plants ,"
cried the beetle.
`` How good they will taste when they are decayed ! A capital store-room this ! There must certainly be relations of mine living here.
I will just see if I can find any one with whom I may associate.
I 'm proud , certainly , and I 'm proud of being so"
Suddenly a hand seized the beetle , and pressed him , and turned him round and round.
The gardener 's little son and a companion had come to the hot-bed , had espied the beetle , and wanted to have their fun with him.
First he was wrapped in a vine leaf , and then put into warm trousers-pocket.
Then the boy went rapidly towards the great lake that lay at the end of the garden.
Now he was a sailor , and had to sail away.
The little ship sailed away.
Then a fly came and paid him a visit.
`` What beautiful weather !"
said the fly.
`` I 'll rest here , and sun myself.
You have an agreeable time of it"
`` You speak without knowing the facts ,"
replied the beetle.
`` Do n't you see that I 'm a prisoner ?"
`` Ah ! but I 'm not a prisoner ,"
observed the fly ; and he flew away accordingly.
`` Well , now I know the world ,"
said the beetle to himself.
`` It is an abominable world.
I 'm the only honest person in it.
That is what annoys me more than all.
If I had received golden shoes , I should have become an ornament to the stable.
Now the stable has lost me , and the world has lost me.
It is all over !"
But all was not over yet.
A boat , in which there were a few young girls , came rowing up.
`` Look , yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along ,"
said one of the girls.
`` There 's a little creature bound fast to it ,"
said another.
The boat came quite close to our beetle 's ship , and the young girls fished him out of the water.
`` Creep , creep -- fly , fly -- if thou canst ,"
she said.
`` Liberty is a splendid thing"
The beetle clung fast to the mane , and sat there a short time to recover himself.
`` Here I 'm sitting on the emperor 's favorite horse -- sitting on him just like the emperor himself !"
he cried.
`` But what was I saying ? Yes , now I remember.
That 's a good thought , and quite correct.
The smith asked me why the golden shoes were given to the horse.
Now I 'm quite clear about the answer.
They were given to the horse on _ my _ account"
And now the beetle was in a good temper again.
`` Travelling expands the mind rarely ,"
said he.
The sun 's rays came streaming into the stable , and shone upon him , and made the place lively and bright.
`` The world is not so bad , upon the whole ,"
said the beetle ; `` but one must know how to take things as they come"
Our rude house was put together of clay ; but the door-posts were columns of fluted marble found near the spot where the house was erected.
The roof reached almost down to the ground.
It was now dark brown and ugly , but it had originally consisted of blooming olive and fresh laurel branches brought from beyond the mountain.
Now the ass sullies it with its feet , but the stream rolls on and on , and becomes clear again.
She sang : `` On the summit of Olympus , in the forest of dwarf firs , lay an old stag.
Then I would clench my fist and cry , `` We will kill the Turks !"
but she repeated from the song the words , `` I will drive them across the islands into the deep sea.
But before evening sank down the roebuck was slain , and before the night came the stag was hunted and dead"
For several days and nights we had been lonely in our hut , when my father came home.
I knew he would bring me shells from the Gulf of Lepanto , or perhaps even a bright gleaming knife.
This time he brought us a child , a little half-naked girl , that he brought under his sheepskin cloak.
He himself had been wounded , and my mother bound up his arm.
The wound was deep , and the thick sheepskin was stiff with frozen blood.
The little maiden was to be my sister.
How radiantly beautiful she looked ! Even my mother 's eyes were not more gentle than hers.
They had sworn brotherhood in their youth , and chosen the most beautiful and virtuous girl in the neighborhood to consecrate their bond of friendship.
I often heard of the strange good custom.
So now the little girl was my sister.
But as yet I did not understand that it was my own countrymen whose many sorrows were mirrored in those tears.
One day there came three Frankish men.
Their dress was different from ours.
When they departed , I accompanied them for some distance , carrying my little sister person_1 , wrapped in a goatskin , on my back.
I never thought of it ; but person_1 and I were really one.
She was always sitting in my lap or riding in the goatskin at my back ; and when I dreamed , she appeared in my dreams.
Two nights afterwards , other men , armed with knives and muskets , came into our tent.
They were Albanians , brave men , my mother told me.
They only stayed a short time.
They wrapped tobacco in strips of paper and smoked it.
I remember they were undecided as to the road they were to take.
But they had to make a choice.
They went , and my father went with them.
Soon afterwards we heard the sound of firing.
The noise was renewed , and soldiers rushed into our hut , and took my mother , and myself , and my sister person_1 prisoners.
Presently I saw the corpses of the robbers brought in ; I saw my father 's corpse too.
I cried and cried till I fell asleep.
When I awoke , we were in prison , but the room was not worse than ours in our own house.
They gave me onions to eat , and musty wine poured from a tarry cask , but we had no better fare at home.
How long we were kept prisoners I do not know ; but many days and nights went by.
When we were set free it was the time of the holy Easter feast.
We went into a church that gleamed with pictures painted on a golden ground.
They were pictures of angels , and very beautiful ; but it seemed to me that our little person_1 was just as beautiful.
In the middle of the floor stood a coffin filled with roses.
`` The Lord Christ is pictured there in the form of a beautiful rose ,"
said my mother ; and the priest announced , `` Christ is risen !"
All the people kissed each other : each one had a burning taper in his hand , and I received one myself , and so did little person_1.
The bagpipes sounded , men danced hand in hand from the church , and outside the women were roasting the Easter lamb.
and thus it was that for the first time I met person_0.
I lay on my back in the boat , person_1 leaned against me , and the stars above us shone brighter than the lamps in our church.
Suddenly there was a splash in the water , and the boat rocked violently.
The summer came.
The sun burned so hot that the leaves turned yellow on the trees.
What peace , what silence ! We walked on through the thick thyme , still fragrant though the sun had scorched its leaves.
Not a single herdsman did we meet , not one solitary hut did we pass.
Everything was quiet and deserted ; but a shooting star announced that in heaven there was yet life.
We reached our old home ; but the hut was a heap of ruins , and a new one had to be built.
A few women lent my mother their aid , and in a few days walls were raised , and covered with a new roof of olive branches.

She was now a beautiful grown girl , and I had become a stout stripling.
The wolf-skins that covered my mother 's and person_1 's bed , I had myself taken from wolves that had fallen beneath my shots.
Years had gone by , when one evening person_0 came in , slender as a reed , strong and brown.
It sounded strange as a legend of the priests , and I looked up to him with a kind of veneration.
`` How much you know !"
I exclaimed ; `` what wonders you can tell of !"
`` But you have told me the finest thing , after all ,"
he replied.
person_1 blushed like a young rose , and my mother kissed person_0.
Every one could see that we were about to go through a solemn ceremony.
We knelt down on the altar steps , and person_1 came before us.
No Greek girl had more beautiful ornaments than she.
Her countenance glowed , and her eyes were like two stars.
We all three prayed silently ; and then she said to us , `` Will you be friends in life and in death ?"
`` Yes ,"
we replied.
`` Will you , whatever may happen , remember this -- my brother is a part of myself.
My secret is his , my happiness is his.
Self-sacrifice , patience -- everything in me belongs to him as to me ?"
And we again answered , `` Yes"
Then she joined our hands and kissed us on the forehead , and we again prayed silently.
When we rose , I saw my mother standing by the church door weeping heartily.
Every thought of our souls lay clear before each of us , and I seized his hand.
`` One thing thou must still know , one thing that till now has been a secret between myself and Heaven.
My whole soul is filled with love ! with a love stronger than the love I bear to my mother and to thee !"
`` And whom do you love ?"
asked person_0 , and his face and neck grew red as fire.
`` I love person_1 ,"
I replied -- and his hand trembled in mine , and he became pale as a corpse.
I saw it ; I understood the cause ; and I believe _ my _ hand trembled.
Brother , think of this : I have seen her daily ; she has grown up beside me , and has become a part of my soul !"
`` And she shall be thine !"
he exclaimed , `` thine ! I may not deceive thee , nor will I do so.
I also love her ; but to-morrow I depart.
Thou must , thou shalt take it"
And we wandered home silently across the mountains.
It was late in the evening when we stood at my mother 's door.
person_1 held the lamp upwards as we entered ; my mother was not there.
She gazed at person_0 with a beautifully mournful gaze.
`` To-morrow you are going from us ,"
she said : `` I am very sorry for it"
`` Sorry !"
he repeated , and in his voice there seemed a trouble as great as the grief I myself felt.
person_1 trembled and burst into tears.
Then I saw no one but her , thought of none but her , and threw my arms round her , and said , `` I love thee !"
Before daybreak he rose , kissed us all , said farewell , and went away.
He had given all his money to my mother for us.
person_1 was my betrothed , and a few days afterwards she became my wife"
After a long time , however , a son was promised to her.
After they are over , he may come forth , bathe in the river , put on new clothes , and visit you.
His name shall be Raja person_0 , and he shall be known far and wide"
`` I must go and see where the voices come from !"
Then , clean of raiment , fair of face , and brave of heart , he rode on his way until he reached his father 's city.
There he sat down to rest awhile by a well , where the women were drawing water in earthen pitchers.
So Raja person_0 was comforted , and began to make ready for fortune.
He took with him his horse Bhaunr and his parrot , both of whom had lived with him since he was born.
person_0 had started off to play chaupur with King Sarkap.
And immediately the headless corpse arose and sat beside Raja person_0.
And , now I am dead , Sins , heavy as lead , Will give me no rest in my grave !"
So the night passed on , dark and dreary , while person_0 sat in the graveyard and talked to the headless corpse.
the corpse begged him to give up the idea saying , `` I am King Sarkap 's brother , and I know his ways.
Every day , before breakfast , he cuts off the heads of two or three men , just to amuse himself.
One day no one else was at hand , so he cut off mine , and he will surely cut off yours on some pretence or another.
Otherwise he will always win"
So person_0 took some of the bones lying about , and fashioned them into dice , and these he put into his pocket.
Then , bidding adieu to the headless corpse , he went on his way to play chaupur with the King.
Then the Prince turned towards the burning forest , and , lo ! the voice was the voice of a tiny cricket.
Nevertheless , person_0 , tender-hearted and strong , snatched it from the fire and set it at liberty.
The Prince smiled , saying , `` What help could _ you _ give _ me _ ?"
Nevertheless , he kept the hair and went on his way.
`` Fair sisters !"
quoth person_0 gaily , `` give me my task and I will perform it"
Then he bethought him of the cricket , and drawing the feeler from his pocket , thrust it into the fire.
Then person_0 said , `` Separate the millet seed from the sand"
`` Is that all ?"
quoth the cricket ; `` had I known how small a job you wanted me to do , I would not have assembled so many of my brethren"
With that the flight of crickets set to work , and in one night they separated the seed from the sand.
But as it swung back again , Kasalu , standing there in his shining armor , drew his sharp sword and severed the ropes.
Then he came to the seventy gongs , all in a row , and he hammered them so hard that they cracked to pieces.
As soon as I 've eaten my bread I 'll go forth and cut off his head !"
Notwithstanding these brave and boastful words , he was in reality very much afraid , having heard of person_0 's renown.
But the food was poisoned.
I am his sworn enemy , and I eat not of his salt !"
So saying , he threw the sweetmeats to Raja Sarkap 's dog , which had followed the slave , and lo ! the dog died.
It has just been set alight , and my children will be baked alive ; therefore I can not rest !"
So Raja person_0 put the kitten in his pocket , and went to play chaupur with the King.
Then they began to play , and it fell to person_0 's lot to make the first move.
Hearing this , Raja Sarkap frowned , and bade his slaves remove Bhaunr , the Arab steed , since he gave his master advice in the game.
Take thy right hand , and place it as I said"
Then his heart rose up once more , and he called boldly to Raja Sarkap , `` Leave my horse and arms here for the present.
Time enough to take them away when you have won my head !"
Then the kitten went and sat at the window through which the rat Dhol Raja used to come , and the game began.
So person_0 won , and took back his arms.
So person_0 won the second stake , and took back Bhaunr , the Arab steed.
No paltry risk -- but life and death at stake ; As Sarkap does , so do , for Sarkap 's sake !"
But person_0 answered back , `` Oh moulded pieces ! favor me to-day ! For sooth it is a man with whom I play.
No paltry risk -- but life and death at stake ; As Heaven does , so do , for Heaven 's sake !"
So they began to play , whilst the women stood round in a circle , and the kitten watched Dhol Raja from the window.
Then Sarkap lost , first his kingdom , then the wealth of the whole world , and lastly his head.
But person_0 rose up in his shining armor , tender-hearted and strong , saying , `` Not so , oh king ! She has done no evil.
Grant us our request , -- Unloose these chains , and live for ever blest !"
And Raja person_0 hearkened to them , and bade King Sarkap set them at liberty.
It has been written , and even printed.
Grown older , she would take cockchafers and beetles , and spit them on pins.
`` The cockchafer is reading ,"
person_0 would say.
`` See how he turns the leaf round and round !"
`` Your headstrong will requires something strong to break it !"
her own mother often said.
`` As a little child , you used to trample on my apron ; but I fear you will one day trample on my heart"
And that is what she really did.
She looked well , and her presumption increased.
When she had been there about a year , her mistress said to her , `` You ought once to visit your parents , person_0"
She did not turn back out of pity for her mother 's poverty , she was only angry.
I 'll make you a present of a great wheaten loaf that you may give to them ; they will certainly be glad to see you again"
And that 's the story.
-LRB- Illustration : INGE TURNS BACK AT THE SIGHT OF HER POOR MOTHER.
Into the moor woman 's brewery did person_0 sink down ; and no one can endure that place long.
A box of mud is a palace compared with the moor woman 's brewery.
She continued fastened to the loaf , and the loaf drew her down as an amber button draws a fragment of straw.
The moor woman was at home , and on that day there were visitors in the brewery.
She sewed biting-leather to be worked into men 's shoes , and which makes them wander about unable to settle anywhere.
`` That 's a girl who has ability !"
she observed , `` and I beg you will give me the little one as a memento of my visit here.
She 'll make a capital statue to stand in my grandson 's antechamber"
And person_0 was given up to her , and this is how person_0 came into Bogey 's domain.
People do n't always go there by the direct path , but they can get there by roundabout routes if they have a tendency in that direction.
That was a never-ending antechamber.
The miser stood there , and had forgotten the key of his strong box , and he knew the key was sticking in the lock.
It would take too long to describe the various sorts of torture that were found there together.
person_0 felt a terrible pain while she had to stand there as a statue , for she was tied fast to the loaf.
`` That 's the fruit of wishing to keep one 's feet neat and tidy ,"
she said to herself.
`` Just look how they 're all staring at me !"
`` It must be a great pleasure to look at me !"
thought person_0 , `` and indeed I have a pretty face and fine clothes"
And she turned her eyes , for she could not turn her head ; her neck was too stiff for that.
But she had not considered how her clothes had been soiled in the moor woman 's brewhouse.
That was very disconcerting.
`` But all the rest of them down here look horrible ,"
she observed to herself , and derived consolation from the thought.
The worst of all was the terrible hunger that tormented her.
`` If this lasts much longer ,"
she said , `` I shall not be able to bear it"
But she had to bear it , and it lasted on and on.
Her mother , indeed , wept much and sorrowed for her , but for all that she said , `` A haughty spirit goes before a fall.
That was thy ruin , person_0.
Thou hast sorely grieved thy mother"
`` Greatly hast thou grieved thy mother , person_0 ,"
said the mother ; `` yes , yes , I thought it would be thus"
`` Oh that I never had been born !"
thought person_0 ; `` it would have been far better.
But what use is my mother 's weeping now ?"
`` They should have punished me ,"
thought person_0 , `` and have driven out the whims I had in my head"
`` That I should have to bear so much evil for this !"
thought person_0 ; `` the others ought to be punished , too , for their sins.
Yes , then there would be plenty of punishing to do.
Ah , how I 'm being tortured !"
And her heart became harder than her outward form.
`` Here in this company one ca n't even become better ,"
she said , `` and I do n't want to become better ! Look , how they 're all staring at me !"
And her heart was full of anger and malice against all men.
`` Now they 've something to talk about at last up yonder.
Ah , how I 'm being tortured !"
Thus , even the children 's mouths spoke hard words of her.
`` But will person_0 never come up here again ?"
asked the little girl.
And the reply was , `` She will never come up again"
`` But if she were to say she was sorry , and to beg pardon , and say she would never do so again ?"
`` Yes , then she might come ; but she will not beg pardon ,"
was the reply.
`` I should be so glad if she would ,"
said the little girl ; and she was quite inconsolable.
`` I 'll give my doll and all my playthings if she may only come up.
It 's too dreadful -- poor person_0 !"
And these words penetrated to person_0 's inmost heart , and seemed to do her good.
It was the first time any one had said , `` Poor person_0 ,"
without adding anything about her faults : a little innocent child was weeping and praying for mercy for her.
While years were passing above her , for where she was there was no change , she heard herself spoken of more and more seldom.
It was the last sigh of her dying mother.
But person_0 knew right well that her good mistress would never come to the place where she was.
And again time went on -- a long , bitter time.
Then person_0 heard her name pronounced once more , and saw two bright stars that seemed gleaming above her.
They were two gentle eyes closing upon earth.
So many years had gone by since the little girl had been inconsolable and wept about `` poor person_0 ,"
And the eyes of the old woman closed , and the eye of her soul was opened to look upon the hidden things.
Long he sat there , before he could rightly see all the beauty around him ; for it was beautiful.
For weeks these toneless songs stirred within the bird ; at last , the holy Christmas-time approached.
And on Christmas morning the sun arose and shone upon the ears of corn , which were surrounded by a number of twittering birds.
It was a hard winter.
The ponds were covered with ice , and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air were stinted for food.
`` Yonder is a sea-swallow , flying away across the water ,"
said the children when they saw the white bird.
Now it dived into the sea , and now it rose again into the clear sunlight.
It gleamed white ; but no one could tell whither it went , though some asserted that it flew straight into the sun"
Now there stood on the road before him two houses facing each other ; the one large and beautiful , the other small and poor.
The large one belonged to a rich man , and the small one to a poor man.
Then the Lord thought , `` I shall be no burden to the rich man , I will stay the night with him"
When the rich man heard some one knocking at his door , he opened the window and asked the stranger what he wanted.
The Lord answered , `` I only ask for a night 's lodging"
Go somewhere else for a lodging ,"
and with this he shut down the window and left the Lord standing there.
So the Lord turned his back on the rich man , and went across to the small house and knocked.
He had hardly done so when the poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler come in.
`` Pass the night with me , it is already dark ,"
said he ; `` you can not go any further to-night"
This pleased the Lord , and he went in.
`` With all my heart ,"
he answered , `` I will go and offer it to him ;"
and he went to the stranger and invited him , if he had no objection , to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly.
Next morning they got up before daybreak , and made as good a breakfast as they could for the guest.
And the Lord said to him , `` Will you wish for a new house instead of this old one ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the man ; `` if I can have that , too , I should like it very much"
And the Lord fulfilled his wish , and changed their old house into a new one , again gave them his blessing , and went on.
Run over and see how that has come to pass"
When the rich man 's wife heard this , she ran back in haste and told her husband how it had happened.
`` Quick !"
said his wife , `` get on your horse.
You can still catch the man up , and then you must ask to have three wishes granted to you"
The rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on his horse , and soon came up with the Lord.
`` Yes ,"
said the Lord ; `` if I ever come back again , I will do so"
Then the rich man asked if might not wish for three things too , as his neighbor had done ? `` Yes ,"
So the Lord said to him , `` Ride home , then , and three wishes which you shall form , shall be fulfilled"
The rich man had now gained what he wanted , so he rode home , and began to consider what he should wish for.
He patted its neck , and said , `` Gently , Lisa ,"
but the horse only began new tricks.
Then at last he was angry , and cried quite impatiently , `` I wish your neck was broken !"
Directly he had said the words , down the horse fell on the ground , and there it lay dead and never moved again.
And thus was his first wish fulfilled.
`` I have still two wishes left ,"
said he , and comforted himself with that thought.
And now as he was walking slowly through the sand , and the sun was burning hot at noon-day , he grew quite hot-tempered and angry.
The saddle hurt his back , and he had not yet any idea what to wish for.
`` If I were to wish for all the riches and treasures in the world ,"
said he to himself , `` I should still to think of all kinds of other things later on , I know that , beforehand.
But I will manage so that there is nothing at all left me to wish for afterwards"
Many a time he thought he had found it , but then it seemed to him to be , after all , too little.
Then it came into his mind , what an easy life his wife had , for she stayed at home in a cool room and enjoyed herself.
And as the last word was spoken , the saddle disappeared from his back , and he saw that his second wish had been fulfilled.
Then he really did feel warm.
He began to run and wanted to be quite alone in his own room at home , to think of something really large for his last wish.
So he said , `` Do bear it , and I will wish for all the riches on earth for thee , only stay where thou art"
The father said , `` Yes , if I can get it , you shall have it ,"
kissed all three , and set out.
`` Aha , you come just at the right moment !"
he said , quite delighted , and called to his servant to climb up and catch the little creature.
But as he approached the tree , a lion leapt from beneath it , shook himself , and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled.
`` He who tries to steal my singing , soaring lark ,"
he cried , `` will I devour"
Then the man said , `` I did not know that the bird belonged to thee.
I will make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself with a large sum of money , only spare my life"
and he told her all , just as it had happened , and begged her not to go there , come what might.
But she consoled him and said , `` Dearest father , indeed your promise must be fulfilled.
I will go thither and soften the lion , so that I may return to thee safely"
Next morning she had the road pointed out to her , took leave , and went fearlessly out into the forest.
On her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle.
When night came , the lion turned into a handsome man , and their wedding was celebrated with great magnificence.
They lived happily together , remained awake at night , and slept in the daytime.
She said , `` Yes , I should very much like to see my father again ,"
and went thither , accompanied by the lions.
She said , `` Ah , but do come with me , I will take great care of thee , and guard thee from all light"
So they went away together , and took with them their little child as well.
But the door was made of green wood which warped and left a little crack which no one noticed.
And as she thought to herself , `` In this no man can help thee ,"
`` No ,"
said the sun , `` I have seen none , but I present thee with a casket , open it when thou art in sorest need"
`` No ,"
said the moon , `` I have seen no dove , but here I give thee an egg , break it when thou art in great need"
`` No ,"
said the night wind , `` I have seen none , but I will ask the three other winds , perhaps they have seen it"
Then she went thither , and found everything as the night wind had said.
There stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was again forsaken.
and opened the casket that the sun had given her.
A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself.
answered she , `` but for flesh and blood"
The bride asked her what she meant by that , so she said , `` Let me sleep a night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps"
But the prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind were whistling outside in the fir-trees.
When therefore day broke , she was led out again , and had to give up the golden dress.
And as that even had been of no avail , she was sad , went out into a meadow , sat down there , and wept.
The little chickens pleased her so much that she immediately came down and asked if they were for sale.
`` Not for money or land , but for flesh and blood ; let me sleep another night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps"
The bride said , `` Yes ,"
intending to cheat her as on the former evening.
The prince said , `` Pour out the draught by the bed-side"
May Heaven pity us.
If our mother only knew ! Come , we will go forth together into the wide world"
The next day when they awoke , the sun was already high in the sky , and shone down hot into the tree.
The brother got up and took the little sister by the hand , and they set off to find the brook.
Then the sister cried , `` Pray , dear brother , do not drink , or you will become a wild beast , and tear me to pieces"
The brother did not drink , although he was so thirsty , but said , `` I will wait for the next spring"
Then the sister cried out , `` Pray , dear brother , do not drink , or you will become a wolf , and devour me"
And now the sister wept over her poor bewitched brother , and the little roe wept also , and sat sorrowfully near to her.
But at last the girl said , `` Be quiet , dear little roe , I will never , never leave you"
Then she untied her golden garter and put it round the roebuck 's neck , and she plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord.
With this she tied the little beast and led it on , and she walked deeper and deeper into the forest.
And if only the brother had had his human form it would have been a delightful life.
For some time they were alone like this in the wilderness.
But it happened that the person_0 of the country held a great hunt in the forest.
`` Oh ,"
said he , to his sister , `` let me be off to the hunt , I can not bear it any longer ;"
and he begged so much that at last she agreed.
`` But ,"
Then the young roebuck sprang away ; so happy was he and so merry in the open air.
When it was dark he ran to the cottage , knocked , and said , `` My little sister , let me in"
Then the door was opened for him , and he jumped in , and rested himself the whole night through upon his soft bed.
His sister opened the door for him , and said , `` But you must be here again in the evening and say your pass-word"
Then a hunter crept after him to the cottage and heard how he said , `` My little sister , let me in ,"
and saw that the door was opened for him , and was shut again at once.
The huntsman took notice of it all , and went to the person_0 and told him what he had seen and heard.
Then the person_0 said , `` To-morrow we will hunt once more"
The little sister , however , was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt.
But the wound was so slight that the roebuck , next morning , did not feel it any more.
I will not let you out"
`` Then you will have me die of grief ,"
answered the roe ; `` when I hear the bugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin"
As soon as the sun had set , the person_0 said to the huntsman , `` Now come and show me the cottage in the wood ;"
and when he was at the door , he knocked and called out , `` Dear little sister , let me in"
Then the door opened , and the person_0 walked in , and there stood a maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen.
The maiden was frightened when she saw , not her little roe , but a man come in who wore a golden crown upon his head.
`` Yes , indeed ,"
answered the maiden , `` but the little roe must go with me , I can not leave him"
The person_0 said , `` It shall stay with you as long as you live , and shall want nothing"
The person_0 took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried her to his palace , where the wedding was held with great pomp.
`` Only be quiet ,"
answered the old woman , and comforted her by saying , `` when the time comes I shall be ready"
But in the bath-room they had made a fire of such deadly heat that the beautiful young Queen was soon suffocated.
She gave her too the shape and the look of the Queen , only she could not make good the lost eye.
But in order that the person_0 might not see it , she was to lie on the side on which she had no eye.
The person_0 went away , and did not find out that a false Queen was lying in the bed.
She took the child out of the cradle , laid it on her arm , and suckled it.
Then she shook up its pillow , laid the child down again , and covered it with the little quilt.
And she did not forget the roebuck , but went into the corner where it lay , and stroked its back.
Then she went quite silently out of the door again.
She came thus many nights and never spoke a word : the nurse always saw her , but she did not dare to tell anyone about it.
The nurse did not answer , but when the Queen had gone again , went to the person_0 and told him all.
The person_0 said , `` Ah , heavens ! what is this ? To-morrow night I will watch by the child"
And she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she disappeared.
The person_0 dared not speak to her , but on the next night he watched again.
Then she said -- `` How fares my child , how fares my roe ? This time I come , then never more"
Then the person_0 could not restrain himself ; he sprang towards her , and said , `` You can be none other than my dear wife"
She answered , `` Yes , I am your dear wife ,"
and at the same moment she received life again , and by God 's grace became fresh , rosy , and full of health.
Then she told the person_0 the evil deed which the wicked witch and her daughter had been guilty of towards her.
The person_0 ordered both to be led before the judge , and judgment was delivered against them.
A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty , and had nothing left but his mill and a large apple-tree behind it.
`` What can that be but my apple-tree ?"
thought the miller , and said , `` Yes ,"
and gave a written promise to the stranger.
He , however , laughed mockingly and said , `` When three years have passed , I will come and carry away what belongs to me ,"
and then he went.
He answered , `` It comes from a stranger who met me in the forest , and promised me great treasure.
I , in return , have promised him what stands behind the mill ; we can very well give him the big apple-tree for it"
`` Ah , husband ,"
The miller 's daughter was a beautiful , pious girl , and lived through the three years in the fear of God and without sin.
The devil appeared quite early , but he could not come near to her.
The miller was afraid , and did so.
The next morning the devil came again , but she had wept on her hands , and they were quite clean.
The miller was shocked and answered , `` How could I cut off my own child 's hands ?"
Then the Evil-one threatened him and said , `` If thou dost not do it thou art mine , and I will take thee thyself"
The father became alarmed , and promised to obey him.
Help me in my need , and forgive me the harm I do thee"
She replied , `` Dear father , do with me what you will , I am your child"
Thereupon she laid down both her hands , and let them be cut off.
Then he had to give in , and had lost all right over her.
The miller said to her , `` I have by means of thee received such great wealth that I will keep thee most delicately as long as thou livest"
But she replied , `` Here I can not stay , I will go forth , compassionate people will give me as much as I require"
Then she knelt down , called on God the Lord , and prayed.
And now she went into the garden and the angel went with her.
She saw a tree covered with beautiful pears , but they were all counted.
Then she went to them , and to still her hunger , ate one with her mouth from the tree , but no more.
When she had eaten the pear , she was satisfied , and went and concealed herself among the bushes.
Then answered the gardener , `` Last night , a spirit came in , who had no hands , and ate off one of the pears with its mouth"
The person_0 said , `` How did the spirit get over the water , and where did it go after it had eaten the pear ?"
And as it must have been an angel , I was afraid , and asked no questions , and did not cry out.
When the spirit had eaten the pear , it went back again"
The person_0 said , `` If it be as thou sayest , I will watch with thee to-night"
When it grew dark the person_0 came into the garden and brought a priest with him , who was to speak to the spirit.
All three seated themselves beneath the tree and watched.
Then the priest went out to them and said , `` Comest thou from heaven or from earth ? Art thou a spirit , or a human being ?"
She replied , `` I am no spirit , but an unhappy mortal deserted by all but God"
The person_0 said , `` If thou art forsaken by all the world , yet will I not forsake thee"
Then she gave birth to a fine boy.
So the old mother made haste to write and announce the joyful news to him.
But the messenger rested by a brook on the way , and as he was fatigued by the great distance , he fell asleep.
The messenger went back with the letter , but rested at the same place and again fell asleep.
The old mother was terribly shocked when she received the letter , and could not believe it.
Then said she to the Queen , `` I can not have thee killed as the person_0 commands , but here thou mayst stay no longer.
Go forth into the wide world with thy child , and never come here again"
The poor woman tied her child on her back , and went away with eyes full of tears.
A snow-white maiden came out of the little house and said , `` Welcome , Lady Queen ,"
and conducted her inside.
Then said the poor woman , `` From whence knowest thou that I was a queen ?"
The white maiden answered , `` I am an angel sent by God , to watch over thee and thy child"
At last the person_0 came home again from the war , and his first wish was to see his wife and the child.
and she showed him the two letters which the Evil-one had forged , and then continued , `` I did as thou badest me ,"
and she showed the tokens , the tongue and eyes.
During the whole of this time he neither ate nor drank , but God supported him.
At length he came into a great forest , and found therein the little house whose sign was , `` Here all dwell free"
Then forth came the white maiden , took him by the hand , led him in , and said , `` Welcome , Lord person_0 ,"
and asked him from whence he came.
The angel offered him meat and drink , but he did not take anything , and only wished to rest a little.
Then he lay down to sleep , and put a handkerchief over his face.
Thereupon the angel went into the chamber where the Queen sat with her son , whom she usually called `` Sorrowful ,"
and said to her , `` Go out with thy child , thy husband hath come"
So she went to the place where he lay , and the handkerchief fell from his face.
Then said she , `` Sorrowful , pick up thy father 's handkerchief , and cover his face again"
The child picked it up , and put it over his face again.
The person_0 in his sleep heard what passed , and had pleasure in letting the handkerchief fall once more.
When the person_0 heard that , he got up , and asked who they were.
Then said she , `` I am thy wife , and that is thy son , Sorrowful"
And he saw her living hands , and said , `` My wife had silver hands"
She answered , `` The good God has caused my natural hands to grow again ;"
and the angel went into the inner room , and brought the silver hands , and showed them to him.
Then the angel of God gave them one meal with her , and after that they went home to the person_0 's aged mother.
There were great rejoicings everywhere , and the person_0 and Queen were married again , and lived contentedly to their happy end"
Away she quickly flew , And Blase informed , what Ninny had in view.
There was once a widow who had two daughters -- one of whom was pretty and industrious , whilst the other was ugly and idle.
Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well , in the highway , and spin and spin till her fingers bled.
She began to weep , and ran to her step-mother and told her of the mishap.
So she went up to it , and took out all the loaves one after another with the bread-shovel.
I am Mother Holle.
As the old woman spoke so kindly to her , the girl took courage and agreed to enter her service.
She attended to everything to the satisfaction of her mistress , and always shook her bed so vigorously that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes.
So she had a pleasant life with her ; never an angry word ; and boiled or roast meat every day.
She stayed some time with Mother Holle , and then she became sad.
Thereupon she took her by the hand , and led her to a large door.
`` You shall have that because you have been so industrious ,"
said Mother Holle , and at the same time she gave her back the shuttle which she had let fall into the well.
Thereupon the door closed , and the maiden found herself up above upon the earth , not far from her mother 's house.
So she went in to her mother , and as she arrived thus covered with gold , she was well received , both by her and her sister.
Then she threw her shuttle into the well , and jumped in after it.
She came , like the other , to the beautiful meadow and walked along the very same path.
But the lazy thing answered , `` As if I had any wish to make myself dirty ?"
and on she went.
Soon she came to the apple-tree , which cried , `` Oh , shake me ! shake me ! we apples are all ripe !"
But she answered , `` I like that ! one of you might fall on my head ,"
and so went on.
Neither did she make Mother Holle 's bed as she ought , and did not shake it so as to make the feathers fly up.
Mother Holle was soon tired of this , and gave her notice to leave.
The lazy girl was willing enough to go , and thought that now the golden rain would come.
`` That is the reward for your service ,"
said Mother Holle , and shut the door.
But the pitch stuck fast to her , and could not be got off as long as she lived"
But the prudent youth answered , `` If I give you my cake and wine , I shall have none for myself ; be off with you ,"
and he left the little man standing and went on.
And this was the little gray man 's doing.
After this the second son went into the forest , and his mother gave him , like the eldest , a cake and a bottle of wine.
The little old gray man met him likewise , and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.
But the second son , too , said with much reason , `` What I give you will be taken away from myself ; be off !"
and he left the little man standing and went on.
Then Dummling said , `` Father , do let me go and cut wood"
The father answered , `` Your brothers have hurt themselves with it , leave it alone , you do not understand anything about it"
But Dummling begged so long that at last he said , `` Just go then , you will get wiser by hurting yourself"
His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders , and with it a bottle of sour beer.
Dummling answered , `` I have only cinder-cake and sour beer ; if that pleases you , we will sit down and eat"
So they sat down , and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake , it was a fine sweet cake , and the sour beer had become good wine.
There stands an old tree , cut it down , and you will find something at the roots"
Then the little man took leave of him.
Dummling went and cut down the tree , and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold.
He lifted her up , and taking her with him , went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night.
The eldest thought , `` I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather ,"
and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing , but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.
At last the third also came with the like intent , and the others screamed out , `` Keep away ; for goodness ' sake keep away !"
But she did not understand why she was to keep away.
`` The others are there ,"
she thought , `` I may as well be there too ,"
and ran to them ; but as soon as she had touched her sister , she remained sticking fast to her.
So they had to spend the night with the goose.
The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out , without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it.
They were obliged to run after him continually , now left , now right , just as he was inclined to go.
Before long the sexton came by and saw his master , the parson , running behind three girls.
and running after him he took him by the sleeve , but was also held fast to it.
But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast , and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.
Soon afterwards he came to a city , where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh.
So he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her.
Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife , and the wedding was celebrated.
After the King 's death , Dummling inherited the kingdom and lived a long time contentedly with his wife"
They all three traveled away together , and came to an ant-hill.
Then they went onwards and came to a lake , on which a great number of ducks were swimming.
In the middle of the door , however , there was a little pane , through which they could see into the room.
There they saw a little gray man , who was sitting at a table.
At last the turn came to Simpleton also , who sought in the moss.
The second task , however , was to fetch out of the lake the key of the King 's daughter 's bed-chamber.
But the third task was the most difficult ; from amongst the three sleeping daughters of the King was the youngest and dearest to be sought out.
Simpleton married the youngest and sweetest princess , and after her father 's death became King , and his two brothers received the two other sisters"
by Brothers Grimm A girl from Brakel once went to St.
Thou know ` st him right well , By Suttmer gate does he dwell , His hair it is golden , Thou know ` st him right well"
YES , they replied , we sage like her shall be , When we with love have equally been free"
Between Werrel and Soist there lived a man whose name was Knoist , and he had three sons.
One was blind , the other lame , and the third stark-naked.
Once on a time they went into a field , and there they saw a hare.
The blind one shot it , the lame one caught it , the naked one put it in his pocket.
They all three got into the one with no bottom to it.
`` How truly happy is that one Who can from holy water run !"
It was far in January , and a terrible fall of snow was pelting down.
Coaches and horses seemed frosted with sugar.
The footmen stood with their backs against the carriages , so as to turn their faces from the wind.
Towards evening it grew calm.
The sky looked as if it had been swept , and had become more lofty and transparent.
The stars looked as if they were quite new , and some of them were amazingly bright and pure.
These little birds hopped up and down where the sweeping had been done ; but they found very little food , and were not a little cold.
`` Piep !"
I 'm dissatisfied , and I 've a right to be so"
`` Yes ; and the people ran about and fired off shots to celebrate the new year ,"
People have made a mistake in reckoning the time !"
`` That they have !"
When spring comes , then the year begins , and I reckon according to that"
`` But when will spring come ?"
the others inquired.
`` It will come when the stork comes back.
But his movements are very uncertain , and here in town no one knows anything about it : in the country they are better informed.
Shall we fly out there and wait ? There , at any rate , we shall be nearer to spring"
`` Yes , that may be all very well ,"
observed one of the sparrows , who had been hopping about for a long time , chirping , without saying anything decided.
`` I 've found a few comforts here in town , which I am afraid I should miss out in the country.
In each flower-pot a hole has been cut , big enough for me to fly in and out at it.
I and my husband have built a nest in one of those pots , and have brought up our young family there.
To please themselves they also strew crumbs of bread ; and so we have food , and are in a manner provided for.
So I think my husband and I will stay where we are , although we are very dissatisfied -- but we shall stay"
`` And we will fly into the country to see if spring is not coming !"
And away they flew.
Out in the country it was hard winter , and the glass was a few degrees lower than in the town.
The sharp winds swept across the snow-covered fields.
The horses ran till they smoked again.
`` Very long ,"
sounded from the next snow-covered hill , far over the field.
`` Who is that old man yonder ?"
asked the sparrows.
`` I know who he is ,"
`` I know who the old man is.
It is Winter , the old man of last year.
He is not dead , as the calendar says , but is guardian to little Prince Spring , who is to come.
Yes , Winter bears sway here.
Ugh ! the cold makes you shiver , does it not , you little ones ?"
`` Yes.
Did I not tell the truth ?"
And one week passed away , and two passed away.
Then a sunbeam glided along over the lake , and made it shine like burnished tin.
`` Kee-wit ! kee-wit ! Is spring coming now ?"
`` Spring !"
On the back of each sat a pretty little child -- one was a girl and the other a boy.
They greeted the earth with a kiss , and wherever they set their feet , white flowers grew up from beneath the snow.
`` That 's what I call spring ,"
cried each of the sparrows.
`` Now we shall get our rights , and have amends for the stern winter"
And the little maiden strewed flowers all around.
That was beautiful to behold.
The world grew young again to her , and she said , `` It is a blessed day out here to-day !"
All nature seemed to say , `` There is plenty , and there shall be plenty always !"
And days went by and weeks went by , and the heat came as it were whirling down.
Hot waves of air came through the corn , that became yellower and yellower.
Every breath of air was hushed , every bird was mute.
The rain poured down in streams , and there was alternate darkness and blinding light ; alternate silence and deafening clamor.
All nature round about was renewed , everything stood luxuriant , strong and beautiful ; it was summer , warm , lovely summer.
Only Summer saw it , he and his strong wife ; for them the altar table stood covered with the offerings of nature.
And days went by , and weeks went by.
The bright scythes of the reapers gleamed in the corn-fields ; the branches of the apple trees bent down , heavy with red-and-yellow fruit.
`` What wealth !"
Now they are already ploughing again in the field.
The people want to gain more and more.
See , the storks flock together , and follow at a little distance behind the plough -- the bird of Egypt that carried us through the air.
`` Do you wish to see the golden fruit ?"
said the man : `` then rejoice"
And he lifted his arm , and the leaves of the forest put on hues of red and gold , and beauteous tints spread over all the woodland.
But the Queen of the Year became more and more silent , and paler and paler.
`` It blows cold ,"
she said , `` and night brings damp mists.
I long for the land of my childhood"
And she saw the storks fly away , one and all ; and she stretched forth her hands towards them.
She looked up at the nests , which stood empty.
I wish him a pleasant journey !"
The forest leaves became more and more yellow , leaf fell down upon leaf , and the stormy winds of autumn howled.
The wet fogs came , an icy wind blew , and the long dark nights drew on apace.
And then the church bells rang for the Christmas time.
`` The bells ring for the new-born ,"
said the Ruler of the Year.
`` May there be joy in the room , and under the green boughs ,"
said the Ruler of the Year.
In a few weeks he had become a very old man , white as snow.
`` My time for rest draws near , and the young pair of the year shall now receive my crown and sceptre"
`` But the might is still thine ,"
said the Angel of Christmas ; `` the might and not the rest.
Let the snow lie warmly upon the young seed.
Learn to bear it , that another receives homage while thou yet reignest.
Learn to bear being forgotten while thou art yet alive.
The hour of thy release will come when spring appears"
`` And when will spring come ?"
asked Winter.
`` It will come when the stork returns"
And in the quiet air old Winter clenched his fists , and the ice was fathoms thick between land and land.
Then the sparrows came again out of the town , and asked , `` Who is that old man yonder ?"
He is not dead , as the almanack says , but he is the guardian of Spring , who is coming"
`` When will spring come ?"
asked the sparrows.
`` Then we shall have good times , and a better rule.
The old one was worth nothing"
That was the summer dream of winter , and the sun scattered the hoar frost from the boughs.
`` When will spring come ?"
asked the sparrows.
`` The spring !"
sounded like an echo from the hills on which the snow lay.
The sun shone warmer , the snow melted , and the birds twittered , `` Spring is coming !"
And aloft through the air came the first stork , and the second followed him.
And the story of the year was done.
`` That is all very well ,"
said the sparrows ; `` it is very beautiful too , but it is not according to the almanack , and therefore it is irregular"
A long time ago there were a King and Queen who said every day , `` Ah , if only we had a child !"
but they never had one.
When eleven of them had made their promises , suddenly the thirteenth came in.
And , without saying a word more , she turned round and left the room.
The King , who would fain keep his dear child from the misfortune , gave orders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should be burnt.
She climbed up the narrow winding-staircase , and reached a little door.
`` Good day , old dame ,"
said the King 's daughter ; `` what are you doing there ?"
`` I am spinning ,"
said the old woman , and nodded her head.
`` What sort of thing is that , that rattles round so merrily ?"
said the girl , and she took the spindle and wanted to spin too.
But scarcely had she touched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled , and she pricked her finger with it.
And the wind fell , and on the trees before the castle not a leaf moved again.
But the story of the beautiful sleeping `` Briar-rose ,"
Then the youth said , `` I am not afraid , I will go and see the beautiful Briar-rose"
The good old man might dissuade him as he would , he did not listen to his words.
But by this time the hundred years had just passed , and the day had come when Briar-rose was to awake again.
In the castle-yard he saw the horses and the spotted hounds lying asleep ; on the roof sat the pigeons with their heads under their wings.
There she lay , so beautiful that he could not turn his eyes away ; and he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
But as soon as he kissed her , Briar-rose opened her eyes and awoke , and looked at him quite sweetly.
And then the marriage of the King 's son with Briar-rose was celebrated with all splendor , and they lived contented to the end of their days"
There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.
At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.
Then her husband was alarmed , and asked , `` What aileth thee , dear wife ?"
`` Ah ,"
she replied , `` if I ca n't get some of the rampion , which is in the garden behind our house , to eat , I shall die"
She at once made herself a salad of it , and ate it with much relish.
She , however , liked it so much -- so very much , that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.
If he was to have any rest , her husband must once more descend into the garden.
`` How canst thou dare ,"
said she with angry look , `` to descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief ? Thou shalt suffer for it !"
`` Ah ,"
answered he , `` let mercy take the place of justice , I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity.
My wife saw your rampion from the window , and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat"
Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun.
When the enchantress wanted to go in , she placed herself beneath it and cried , `` Rapunzel , Rapunzel , Let down thy hair to me"
After a year or two , it came to pass that the King 's son rode through the forest and went by the tower.
Then he heard a song , which was so charming that he stood still and listened.
This was Rapunzel , who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.
The King 's son wanted to climb up to her , and looked for the door of the tower , but none was to be found.
He rode home , but the singing had so deeply touched his heart , that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.
Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair , and the enchantress climbed up to her.
`` If that is the ladder by which one mounts , I will for once try my fortune ,"
Immediately the hair fell down and the King 's son climbed up.
and she said yes , and laid her hand in his.
She said , `` I will willingly go away with thee , but I do not know how to get down.
They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening , for the old woman came by day.
`` Ah ! thou wicked child ,"
cried the enchantress `` What do I hear thee say ! I thought I had separated thee from all the world , and yet thou hast deceived me"
And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.
she let the hair down.
`` Aha !"
Rapunzel is lost to thee ; thou wilt never see her more"
The King 's son was beside himself with pain , and in his despair he leapt down from the tower.
He escaped with his life , but the thorns into which he fell , pierced his eyes.
Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again , and he could see with them as before.
He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received , and they lived for a long time afterwards , happy and contented"
In former days every sound still had its meaning and application.
When the smith 's hammer resounded , it cried , `` Strike away ! strike away"
When the carpenter 's plane grated , it said , `` Here goes ! here goes"
If the mill wheel began to clack , it said , `` Help , Lord God ! help , Lord God !"
and then answered quickly , `` The miller ! the miller !"
and at last quite in a hurry , `` He steals bravely ! he steals bravely ! three pecks in a bushel"
One alone amongst them , the green plover , was opposed to this.
He retired into a solitary and unfrequented marsh , and showed himself no more among his fellows.
The hen , which by some accident had heard nothing of the whole matter , was astonished at the great assemblage.
`` What , what , what is going to be done ?"
she cackled ; but the cock calmed his beloved hen , and said , `` Only rich people ,"
and told her what they had on hand.
It was decided , however , that the one who could fly the highest should be person_0.
A tree-frog which was sitting among the bushes , when he heard that , cried a warning , `` No , no , no ! no !"
because he thought that many tears would be shed because of this ; but the crow said , `` Caw , caw ,"
and that all would pass off peaceably.
On a given signal , therefore , the whole troop rose up in the air.
The little birds were , however , soon left behind.
They could go no farther , and fell back to the ground.
and began to let himself down again.
The birds beneath him at once cried to him.
`` Thou must be our person_0 , no one has flown so high as thou"
`` Except me ,"
screamed the little fellow without a name , who had crept into the breast-feathers of the eagle.
And as he was not at all tired , he rose up and mounted so high that he reached heaven itself.
`` Thou , our person_0 ?"
cried the birds angrily.
`` Thou hast compassed it by trick and cunning !"
So they made another condition.
He should be person_0 who could go down lowest in the ground.
`` Thou our person_0 !"
cried the birds still more angrily.
`` Dost thou think thy cunning shall prevail ?"
They determined to keep him a prisoner in the hole and starve him out.
The owl was placed as sentinel in front of it , and was not to let the rascal out if she had any value for her life.
The owl alone remained standing by the mouse-hole , gazing steadfastly into it with her great eyes.
So she shut one eye , and with the other looked straight at the mouse-hole.
Then the owl opened the one eye again , and shut the other , intending to shut them in turn all through the night.
The little fellow soon observed that , and slipped away.
She only flies out by night , but hates and pursues mice because they make such ugly holes.
He steals about in the hedges , and when he is quite safe , he sometimes cries , `` I am person_0 ,"
and for this reason , the other birds call him in mockery , ` person_0 of the hedges ' -LRB- Zaunk nig -RRB-.
No one , however , was so happy as the lark at not having to obey the little person_0.
The girls were acquainted with each other , and went out walking together , and afterwards came to the woman in her house.
The girl went home , and told her father what the woman had said.
The man said , `` What shall I do ? Marriage is a joy and also a torment"
Go with it up to the loft , hang it on the big nail , and then pour water into it.
If it hold the water , then I will again take a wife , but if it run through , I will not"
The girl did as she was ordered , but the water drew the hole together , and the boot became full to the top.
She informed her father how it had turned out.
On the second morning , stood water for washing and water for drinking before the man 's daughter as well as before the woman 's daughter.
The woman became bitterly unkind to her step-daughter , and day by day did her best to treat her still worse.
She was also envious because her step-daughter was beautiful and lovable , and her own daughter ugly and repulsive.
`` Good heavens !"
said the girl , `` no strawberries grow in winter ! The ground is frozen , and besides the snow has covered everything.
`` Wilt thou contradict me again ?"
said the stepmother , `` See that thou goest , and do not show thy face again until thou hast the basketful of strawberries !"
Then she gave her a little piece of hard bread , and said , `` This will last thee the day ,"
and thought , `` Thou wilt die of cold and hunger outside , and wilt never be seen again by me"
Then the maiden was obedient , and put on the paper frock , and went out with the basket.
Far and wide there was nothing but snow , and not a green blade to be seen.
When she got into the wood she saw a small house out of which peeped three dwarfs.
She wished them good day , and knocked modestly at the door.
They cried , `` Come in ,"
and she entered the room and seated herself on the bench by the stove , where she began to warm herself and eat her breakfast.
The elves said , `` Give us , too , some of it"
`` Willingly ,"
she said , and divided her bit of bread in two and gave them the half.
They asked , `` What dost thou here in the forest in the winter time , in thy thin dress ?"
`` Ah ,"
she answered , `` I am to look for a basketful of strawberries , and am not to go home until I can take them with me"
When she had eaten her bread , they gave her a broom and said , `` Sweep away the snow at the back door with it"
Then said the first , `` My gift is , that she shall every day grow more beautiful"
The second said , `` My gift is , that gold pieces shall fall out of her mouth every time she speaks"
The third said , `` My gift is , that a king shall come and take her to wife"
When she went in and said good-evening , a piece of gold at once fell from her mouth.
`` Now look at her arrogance ,"
cried the step-sister , `` to throw about gold in that way !"
but she was secretly envious of it , and wanted to go into the forest also to seek strawberries.
The mother said , `` No , my dear little daughter , it is too cold , thou mightest die of cold"
The girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house.
`` Give us some of it ,"
cried the little men ; but she replied , `` There is not enough for myself , so how can I give it away to other people ?"
When she had done eating , they said , `` There is a broom for thee , sweep all clean for us outside by the back-door"
`` Humph ! Sweep for yourselves ,"
she answered , `` I am not your servant"
When she saw that they were not going to give her anything , she went out by the door.
The first said , `` I grant that she may grow uglier every day"
The second said , `` I grant that at every word she says , a toad shall spring out of her mouth"
The third said , `` I grant that she may die a miserable death"
The maiden looked for strawberries outside , but as she found none , she went angrily home.
At length she took a cauldron , set it on the fire , and boiled yarn in it.
The carriage stopped , and the King asked , `` My child , who are thou , and what art thou doing here ?"
`` I am a poor girl , and I am rinsing yarn"
`` Ah , yes , with all my heart ,"
she answered , for she was glad to get away from the mother and sister.
Then the ugly daughter laid herself in the bed , and the old woman covered her up over her head.
And as he returned no answer , it said , `` And my guests , What may they do ?"
The scullion said , `` They are sleeping soundly , too"
Then it asked again , `` What does little baby mine ?"
He answered , `` Sleepeth in her cradle fine"
And when it was christened he said , `` What does a person deserve who drags another out of bed and throws him in the water ?"
`` The wretch deserves nothing better ,"
answered the old woman , `` than to be taken and put in a barrel stuck full of nails , and rolled down hill into the water"
`` Then ,"
said the King , `` Thou hast pronounced thine own sentence ;"
The tale is this , we purpose to relate ; And full particulars we now will state.
Our lady 's face was like a saint 's in Lent : Quite wan , though otherwise it marked content.
This still was worse , though , if we rightly guess , 'Twas by her wished , durst she the truth confess.
Nor that the Abbess should , within her soul , Retain what might injuriously control.
THE operation o ` er , her lily face Resumed the rose , and ev ` ry other grace.
This point of honor is another ill , In which the faculty confess no skill.
WHAT ills in life ! what mis ` ries dire around , While remedies so easy may be found !"
The more he tried , the ringlet less inclined To drop the curvature so closely twined.
One summer 's morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window ; he was in good spirits , and sewed with all his might.
Then came a peasant woman down the street crying , `` Good jams , cheap ! Good jams , cheap !"
The woman came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket , and he made her unpack the whole of the pots for him.
The woman who had hoped to find a good sale , gave him what he desired , but went away quite angry and grumbling.
`` Now , God bless the jam to my use ,"
cried the little tailor , `` and give me health and strength ;"
so he brought the bread out of the cupboard , cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it.
`` This wo n't taste bitter ,"
said he , `` but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite"
He laid the bread near him , sewed on , and in his joy , made bigger and bigger stitches.
`` Hola ! who invited you ?"
said the little tailor , and drove the unbidden guests away.
The flies , however , who understood no German , would not be turned away , but came back again in ever-increasing companies.
struck it mercilessly on them.
When he drew it away and counted , there lay before him no fewer than seven , dead and with legs stretched out.
`` Art thou a fellow of that sort ?"
said he , and could not help admiring his own bravery.
`` The whole town shall know of this !"
And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle , stitched it , and embroidered on it in large letters , `` Seven at one stroke !"
`` What , the town !"
he continued , `` The whole world shall hear of it !"
and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb 's tail.
The tailor put on the girdle , and resolved to go forth into the world , because he thought his workshop was too small for his valor.
In front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket.
It had to go into his pocket with the cheese.
Now he took to the road boldly , and as he was light and nimble , he felt no fatigue.
Hast thou any inclination to go with me ?"
The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor , and said , `` Thou ragamuffin ! Thou miserable creature !"
`` Oh , indeed ?"
The giant read , `` Seven at one stroke ,"
and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed , and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow.
Nevertheless , he wished to try him first , and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it.
`` Do that likewise ,"
said the giant , `` if thou hast strength ?"
`` Is that all ?"
said the tailor , `` that is child 's play with us !"
and put his hand into his pocket , brought out the soft cheese , and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it.
`` Faith ,"
said he , `` that was a little better , was n't it ?"
The giant did not know what to say , and could not believe it of the little man.
Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high"
There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still a little child.
The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her , kept her to her work , and educated her in all that is good.
About this time , the son of the King was traveling about the country looking for a bride.
He was not to choose a poor one , and did not want to have a rich one.
So he said , `` She shall be my wife who is the poorest , and at the same time the richest"
He looked at her , said nothing , and rode on.
When he came to the house of the poor girl , she was not standing at the door , but sitting in her little room.
Then she went to the window , opened it , and said , `` It is so warm in this room !"
but she still looked after him as long as she could distinguish the white feathers in his hat.
Before long , it had entirely vanished from her sight.
The spindle , however , danced continually onwards , and just as the thread came to an end , reached the prince.
`` What do I see ?"
he cried ; `` the spindle certainly wants to show me the way !"
turned his horse about , and rode back with the golden thread.
Immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.
Before the threshold , however , it began to weave a carpet which was more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld.
The shuttle leapt hither and thither , and everything seemed to grow of its own accord.
As the shuttle had run away , the girl sat down to sew.
She held the needle in her hand and sang , `` Needle , my needle , sharp-pointed and fine , Prepare for a wooer this house of mine"
Then the needle leapt out of her fingers , and flew everywhere about the room as quick as lightning.
`` Thou art the poorest and also the richest ,"
said he to her.
`` Come with me , thou shalt be my bride"
She did not speak , but she gave him her hand.
The spindle , shuttle , and needle were preserved in the treasure-chamber , and held in great honor"
Strange fool ! as if their wiles , to speak the truth , Were not a hydra , both in age and youth.
The gay gallant , who watched the lucky hour , Felt doubly blessed to have her in his power.
HOW vain our schemes to guard the wily sex ! Oft plots we find , that ev ` ry sense perplex.
Go , jealous husbands , books of cases burn ; Caresses lavish , and you 'll find return"
After person_0 Coon played barber-shop with Jimmy Rabbit and his brother it was a long time before he met them again.
But one day person_0 was wandering through the woods when he caught sight of Jimmy.
Jimmy dodged behind a tree.
And person_0 saw Jimmy 's brother peep from behind another.
You see , his ears were so long that they stuck far beyond the tree , and person_0 could n't help seeing them.
`` Hello !"
person_0 called.
`` I 'm glad to see you"
And he told the truth , too.
He had been trying to find those two brothers for weeks , because he wanted to get even with them for cutting off his moustache.
Jimmy and his brother hopped out from behind their trees.
`` Hello !"
said Jimmy.
`` We were just looking for you"
Probably he meant to say , `` We were just looking AT you"
He was somewhat upset by meeting person_0 ; for he knew that person_0 was angry with him.
`` Oh , ho ! You were , were you ?"
person_0 answered.
He began to slide down the tree he had been climbing.
Jimmy Rabbit and his brother edged a little further away.
`` Better not come too near us !"
he said.
`` We 've both got the pink-eye , and you do n't want to catch it"
person_0 paused and looked at the brothers.
Sure enough ! their eyes were as pink as anything.
`` Does it hurt much ?"
person_0 asked.
`` Well -- it does and it does n't ,"
Jimmy replied.
`` I just stuck a brier into one of my eyes a few minutes ago and it hurt awful , then.
But you 'll be perfectly safe , so long as you do n't touch us"
`` How long does it last ?"
person_0 inquired.
`` Probably we 'll never get over it ,"
Jimmy Rabbit said cheerfully.
And his brother nodded his head , as much as to say , `` That 's so !"
person_0 Coon was just the least bit alarmed.
He really thought that there was something the matter with their eyes.
You see , though the Rabbit brothers ' eyes were always pink -LRB- for they were born that way -RRB- , he had never noticed it before.
So person_0 thought it would be safer not to go too near them.
`` Well , it 's too bad ,"
he told Jimmy.
`` I 'm sorry.
I wanted to play with you"
`` Oh , that 's all right !"
Jimmy said.
`` We can play , just the same.
I 'll tell you what we 'll play.
We 'll play --"
`` Not barber-shop !"
person_0 interrupted.
`` I wo n't play barber-shop , I never liked that game"
Jimmy Rabbit started to smile.
But he turned his smile into a sneeze.
And he said -- `` We 'll play robber.
You 'll like that , I know.
And you can be the robber.
You look like one , anyhow"
That remark made person_0 Coon angry.
And he wished that Jimmy had n't the pink-eye.
He would have liked to make an end of him right then and there.
`` What do you mean ?"
he shouted.
`` Robber nothing ! I 'm just as good as you are !"
`` Of course , of course !"
Jimmy said hastily.
`` It 's your face , you know , That black patch covers your eyes just like a robber 's mask.
That 's why we want you to be the robber"
person_0 had slipped down his tree to the ground ; and now he looked down into the creek.
It was just as Jimmy said.
`` Come on !"
said Jimmy.
`` We ca n't play the game without you"
`` Well -- all right !"
said person_0.
He began to feel proud of his mask.
`` What shall I do ?"
`` You wait right here ,"
Jimmy ordered.
`` Hide behind that tree.
We 'll go into the woods.
And when we come back past this spot you jump out and say ` Hands up ! '.
You understand ?"
`` Of course !"
said person_0.
`` But hurry up ! Do n't be gone long"
`` Leave that to us ,"
said Jimmy Rabbit.
He winked at his brother ; and they started off together.
person_0 Coon did not see that wink.
If he had , he would n't have waited there all the afternoon for those Rabbit brothers to return.
They never came back at all.
And they told everybody about the trick they had played on person_0 Coon.
For a long time after that wherever person_0 went the forest-people called `` Robber !"
after him.
And Jasper Jay was the most annoying of all , because whenever he shouted `` Robber !"
he always laughed so loudly and so long.
His hoarse screech echoed through the woods.
And the worst of it was , everybody knew what he was laughing at"
Once upon a time there was a wee wee person_0 , who frolicked about on his little tottery legs , and enjoyed himself amazingly.
The Jackal thought this reasonable , and let person_0 pass.
The Vulture thought this reasonable , and let person_0 pass.
`` I 'll tell you what you must do ,"
Soon he met with the Eagle , who called out : `` Drumikin ! Drumikin ! Have you seen person_0 ?"
And Mr.
person_0 , curled up in his soft warm nest , replied : `` Fallen into the fire , and so will you On little Drumikin.
Tum-pa , tum-too !"
`` How very annoying !"
sighed the Eagle , thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip.
Meanwhile person_0 trundled along , laughing to himself , and singing : `` Tum-pa , tum-too ; Tum-pa , tum-too !"
Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question : `` Drumikin ! Drumikin ! Have you seen person_0 ?"
And to each of them the little slyboots replied : `` Fallen into the fire , and so will you On little Drumikin.
Tum-pa , tum too ; Tum-pa , tum-too ; Tum-pa , tum-too !"
Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip.
Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up person_0"
And when the child was born , the Queen died.
After a year had passed the King took to himself another wife.
She was a beautiful woman , but proud and haughty , and she could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty.
the looking-glass answered -- `` Thou , O Queen , art the fairest of all !"
Then she was satisfied , for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth.
And once when the Queen asked her looking-glass -- `` Looking-glass , Looking-glass , on the wall , Who in this land is the fairest of all ?"
it answered -- `` Thou art fairer than all who are here , Lady Queen"
But more beautiful still is person_0-white , as I ween"
Then the Queen was shocked , and turned yellow and green with envy.
From that hour , whenever she looked at person_0-white , her heart heaved in her breast , she hated the girl so much.
And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed , so that she had no peace day or night.
She called a huntsman , and said , `` Take the child away into the forest ; I will no longer have her in my sight.
Kill her , and bring me back her heart as a token"
And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said , `` Run away , then , you poor child"
`` The wild beasts will soon have devoured you ,"
thought he , and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her.
The cook had to salt this , and the wicked Queen ate it , and thought she had eaten the heart of person_0-white.
Everything in the cottage was small , but neater and cleaner than can be told.
Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side , and covered with snow-white counterpanes.
When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back ; they were seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for ore.
.
The first said , `` Who has been sitting on my chair ?"
The second , `` Who has been eating off my plate ?"
The third , `` Who has been taking some of my bread ?"
The fourth , `` Who has been eating my vegetables ?"
The fifth , `` Who has been using my fork ?"
The sixth , `` Who has been cutting with my knife ?"
The seventh , `` Who has been drinking out of my mug ?"
The others came up and each called out , `` Somebody has been lying in my bed too"
But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little person_0-white , who was lying asleep therein.
`` Oh , heavens ! oh , heavens !"
cried they , `` what a lovely child !"
and they were so glad that they did not wake her up , but let her sleep on in the bed.
And the seventh dwarf slept with his companions , one hour with each , and so got through the night.
When it was morning little person_0-white awoke , and was frightened when she saw the seven dwarfs.
But they were friendly and asked her what her name was.
`` My name is person_0-white ,"
she answered.
`` How have you come to our house ?"
said the dwarfs.
`` Yes ,"
said person_0-white , `` with all my heart ,"
and she stayed with them.
Little person_0-white looked out of the window and called out , `` Good-day my good woman , what have you to sell ?"
`` Good things , pretty things ,"
she answered ; `` stay-laces of all colors ,"
and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-coloured silk.
`` I may let the worthy old woman in ,"
thought person_0-white , and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.
`` Child ,"
said the old woman , `` what a fright you look ; come , I will lace you properly for once"
person_0-white had no suspicion , but stood before her , and let herself be laced with the new laces.
But the old woman laced so quickly and so tightly that person_0-white lost her breath and fell down as if dead.
`` Now I am the most beautiful ,"
said the Queen to herself , and ran away.
When she heard that , all her blood rushed to her heart with fear , for she saw plainly that little person_0-white was again alive.
`` But now ,"
she said , `` I will think of something that shall put an end to you ,"
and by the help of witchcraft , which she understood , she made a poisonous comb.
Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman.
Little person_0-white looked out and said , `` Go away ; I can not let any one come in"
`` I suppose you can look ,"
said the old woman , and pulled the poisonous comb out and held it up.
It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled , and opened the door.
When they had made a bargain the old woman said , `` Now I will comb you properly for once"
`` You paragon of beauty ,"
said the wicked woman , `` you are done for now ,"
and she went away.
But fortunately it was almost evening , when the seven dwarfs came home.
When they saw person_0-white lying as if dead upon the ground they at once suspected the step-mother , and they looked and found the poisoned comb.
Scarcely had they taken it out when person_0-white came to herself , and told them what had happened.
Then they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to no one.
When she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage.
`` person_0-white shall die ,"
she cried , `` even if it costs me my life !"
Thereupon she went into a quite secret , lonely room , where no one ever came , and there she made a very poisonous apple.
She knocked at the door.
person_0-white put her head out of the window and said , `` I can not let any one in ; the seven dwarfs have forbidden me"
`` It is all the same to me ,"
answered the woman , `` I shall soon get rid of my apples.
There , I will give you one"
`` No ,"
said person_0-white , `` I dare not take anything"
`` Are you afraid of poison ?"
said the old woman ; `` look , I will cut the apple in two pieces ; you eat the red cheek , and I will eat the white"
The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned.
But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead.
And when she asked of the Looking-glass at home -- `` Looking-glass , Looking-glass , on the wall , Who in this land is the fairest of all ?"
it answered at last -- `` Oh , Queen , in this land thou art fairest of all"
Then her envious heart had rest , so far as an envious heart can have rest.
The dwarfs , when they came home in the evening , found person_0-white lying upon the ground ; she breathed no longer and was dead.
They laid her upon a bier , and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her , and wept three days long.
Then they were going to bury her , but she still looked as if she were living , and still had her pretty red cheeks.
They said , `` We could not bury her in the dark ground ,"
Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain , and one of them always stayed by it and watched it.
And birds came too , and wept for person_0-white ; first an owl , then a raven , and last a dove.
It happened , however , that a king 's son came into the forest , and went to the dwarfs ' house to spend the night.
He saw the coffin on the mountain , and the beautiful person_0-white within it , and read what was written upon it in golden letters.
Then he said to the dwarfs , `` Let me have the coffin , I will give you whatever you want for it"
But the dwarfs answered , `` We will not part with it for all the gold in the world"
Then he said , `` Let me have it as a gift , for I can not live without seeing person_0-white.
I will honor and prize her as my dearest possession"
As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him , and gave him the coffin.
And now the King 's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders.
And before long she opened her eyes , lifted up the lid of the coffin , sat up , and was once more alive.
`` Oh , heavens , where am I ?"
she cried.
The King 's son , full of joy , said , `` You are with me ,"
And person_0-white was willing , and went with him , and their wedding was held with great show and splendor.
But person_0-white 's wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast.
the glass answered -- `` Oh , Queen , of all here the fairest art thou , But the young Queen is fairer by far as I trow"
Then the wicked woman uttered a curse , and was so wretched , so utterly wretched , that she knew not what to do.
At first she would not go to the wedding at all , but she had no peace , and must go to see the young Queen.
And when she went in she knew person_0-white ; and she stood still with rage and fear , and could not stir.
But iron slippers had already been put upon the fire , and they were brought in with tongs , and set before her.
Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes , and dance until she dropped down dead"
A King had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure , but so proud and haughty withal that no suitor was good enough for her.
She sent away one after the other , and ridiculed them as well.
Once the King made a great feast and invited thereto , from far and near , all the young men likely to marry.
she said.
Another was too tall , `` Long and thin has little in"
The third was too short , `` Short and thick is never quick"
The fourth was too pale , `` As pale as death"
The fifth too red , `` A fighting-cock"
The sixth was not straight enough , `` A green log dried behind the stove"
`` Well ,"
she cried and laughed , `` he has a chin like a thrush 's beak !"
and from that time he got the name of King Thrushbeard.
A few days afterwards a fiddler came and sang beneath the windows , trying to earn a small alms.
When the King heard him he said , `` Let him come up"
The King said , `` Your song has pleased me so well that I will give you my daughter there , to wife"
All she could say was in vain ; the priest was brought , and she had to let herself be wedded to the fiddler on the spot.
The beggar-man led her out by the hand , and she was obliged to walk away on foot with him.
When they came to a large forest she asked , `` To whom does that beautiful forest belong ?"
`` It belongs to King Thrushbeard ; if you had taken him , it would have been yours"
`` Ah , unhappy girl that I am , if I had but taken King Thrushbeard !"
Afterwards they came to a meadow , and she asked again , `` To whom does this beautiful green meadow belong ?"
`` It belongs to King Thrushbeard ; if you had taken him , it would have been yours"
`` Ah , unhappy girl that I am , if I had but taken King Thrushbeard !"
Then they came to a large town , and she asked again , `` To whom does this fine large town belong ?"
`` It belongs to King Thrushbeard ; if you had taken him , it would have been yours"
`` Ah , unhappy girl that I am , if I had but taken King Thrushbeard !"
`` It does not please me ,"
said the fiddler , `` to hear you always wishing for another husband ; am I not good enough for you ?"
The fiddler answered , `` That is my house and yours , where we shall live together"
She had to stoop in order to go in at the low door.
`` Where are the servants ?"
said the King 's daughter.
`` What servants ?"
answered the beggar-man ; `` you must yourself do what you wish to have done.
Just make a fire at once , and set on water to cook my supper , I am quite tired"
But the King 's daughter knew nothing about lighting fires or cooking , and the beggar-man had to lend a hand himself to get anything fairly done.
For a few days they lived in this way as well as might be , and came to the end of all their provisions.
Then the man said , `` Wife , we can not go on any longer eating and drinking here and earning nothing.
You weave baskets"
He went out , cut some willows , and brought them home.
Then she began to weave , but the tough willows wounded her delicate hands.
`` I see that this will not do ,"
said the man ; `` you had better spin , perhaps you can do that better"
She sat down and tried to spin , but the hard thread soon cut her soft fingers so that the blood ran down.
`` See ,"
said the man , `` you are fit for no sort of work ; I have made a bad bargain with you.
Now I will try to make a business with pots and earthenware ; you must sit in the market-place and sell the ware"
`` Alas ,"
But it was of no use , she had to yield unless she chose to die of hunger.
So they lived on what she had earned as long as it lasted , then the husband bought a lot of new crockery.
With this she sat down at the corner of the market-place , and set it out round about her ready for sale.
But suddenly there came a drunken hussar galloping along , and he rode right amongst the pots so that they were all broken into a thousand bits.
She began to weep , and did now know what to do for fear.
`` Alas ! what will happen to me ?"
cried she ; `` what will my husband say to this ?"
She ran home and told him of the misfortune.
`` Who would seat herself at a corner of the market-place with crockery ?"
The King 's daughter was now a kitchen-maid , and had to be at the cook 's beck and call , and do the dirtiest work.
In both her pockets she fastened a little jar , in which she took home her share of the leavings , and upon this they lived.
All at once the King 's son entered , clothed in velvet and silk , with gold chains about his neck.
For love of you I disguised myself so ; and I also was the hussar who rode through your crockery.
This was all done to humble your proud spirit , and to punish you for the insolence with which you mocked me"
Then she wept bitterly and said , `` I have done great wrong , and am not worthy to be your wife"
But he said , `` Be comforted , the evil days are past ; now we will celebrate our wedding"
I wish you and I had been there too"
ONCE upon a time there was a frog called person_0.
Jeremy person_1 ; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.
THE water was all slippy - sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.
But person_0.
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
`` If I catch more than five fish , I will invite my friends person_0.
Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton.
The Alderman , however , eats salad"
MR.
THE boat was round and green , and very like the other lily-leaves.
It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.
MR.
JEREMY took a reed pole , and pushed the boat out into open water.
`` I know a good place for minnows ,"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
MR.
JEREMY stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it.
Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle.
He had the dearest little red float.
THE rain trickled down his back , and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.
`` This is getting tiresome , I think I should like some lunch ,"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
HE punted back again amongst the water - plants , and took some lunch out of his basket.
`` I will eat a butterfly sandwich , and wait till the shower is over ,"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
A GREAT big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes.
person_0.
Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter , out of reach , and went on eating his sandwich.
ONCE or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.
`` I trust that is not a rat ,"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1 ; `` I think I had better get away from here"
MR.
JEREMY shoved the boat out again a little way , and dropped in the bait.
There was a bite almost directly ; the float gave a tremendous bobbit ! `` A minnow ! a minnow ! I have him by the nose !"
cried person_0.
Jeremy person_1 , jerking up his rod.
BUT what a horrible surprise ! Instead of a smooth fat minnow , person_0.
Then he jumped back into the water.
AND a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out , and laughed at person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
AND while person_0.
Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh ! A GREAT big enormous trout came up -- ker - pflop-p-p-p ! with a splash -- and it seized person_0.
Jeremy with a snap , `` Ow ! Ow ! Ow !"
Jeremy 's goloshes.
MR.
HE scrambled out on the first bank he came to , and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.
`` WHAT a mercy that was not a pike !"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
HE put some sticking plaster on his fingers , and his friends both came to dinner.
He could not offer them fish , but he had something else in his larder.
SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat , AND person_0.
Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.
Once upon a time , a tiger was caught in a trap.
He tried in vain to get out through the bars , and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed.
By chance a poor person_0 came by.
`` Let me out of this cage , oh pious one !"
cried the tiger.
`` Nay , my friend ,"
replied the person_0 mildly , `` you would probably eat me if I did"
`` Not at all !"
swore the tiger with many oaths ; `` on the contrary , I should be for ever grateful , and serve you as a slave !"
The person_0 , still more sad , asked the road to give him its opinion.
`` My dear sir ,"
person_0 ? You look as miserable as a fish out of water !"
The person_0 told him all that had occurred.
`` How very confusing !"
said the jackal , when the recital was ended ; `` would you mind telling me over again , for everything has got so mixed up ?"
The person_0 told it all over again , but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way , and still could not understand.
`` It 's very odd ,"
So they returned to the cage , by which the tiger was waiting for the person_0 , and sharpening his teeth and claws.
`` You 've been away a long time !"
growled the savage beast , `` but now let us begin our dinner"
_ Our _ dinner !"
thought the wretched person_0 , as his knees knocked together with fright ; `` what a remarkably delicate way of putting it !"
`` Give me five minutes , my lord !"
he pleaded , `` in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here , who is somewhat slow in his wits"
The tiger consented , and the person_0 began the whole story over again , not missing a single detail , and spinning as long a yarn as possible.
`` Oh , my poor brain ! oh , my poor brain !"
cried the jackal , wringing its paws.
`` Let me see ! how did it all begin ? You were in the cage , and the tiger came walking by --"
`` Pooh !"
interrupted the tiger , `` what a fool you are ! _ I _ was in the cage"
`` Of course !"
`` Yes , you shall !"
`` Yes , my lord !"
`` And that is the person_0 --"
`` Yes , my lord !"
`` And that is the cage --"
`` Yes , my lord !"
`` And I was in the cage -- do you understand ?"
`` Yes -- no -- Please , my lord --"
`` Well ?"
cried the tiger impatiently.
`` Please , my lord ! -- how did you get in ?"
`` How ! -- why in the usual way , of course !"
At this the tiger lost patience , and , jumping into the cage , cried , `` This way ! Now do you understand how it was ?"
`` Perfectly !"
There were two Cocks -- one on the dunghill , the other on the roof.
Both were conceited ; but which of the two effected most ? Tell us your opinion ; but we shall keep our own nevertheless.
`` That 's a privilege of birth ,"
the Cucumber said to herself.
`` Not all can be born cucumbers ; there must be other kinds too.
The fowls , the ducks , and all the cattle in the neighbouring yard are creatures too.
I now look up to the Yard Cock on the partition.
said the Cucumber.
In the night the weather became very bad.
Hens , chickens , and even the Cock himself sought shelter.
The wind blew down the partition between the two yards with a crash ; the tiles came tumbling down , but the Weathercock sat firm.
He did not even turn round ; he could not turn round , and yet he was young and newly cast , but steady and sedate.
He had been `` born old ,"
and did not at all resemble the birds that fly beneath the vault of heaven , such as the sparrows and the swallows.
He despised those , considering them piping birds of trifling stature -- ordinary song birds.
`` Moreover , they are tedious things to converse with ,"
said the Weathercock.
`` They are tedious , and all is tedious ,"
he said.
`` No one is fit to associate with , and one and all of them are wearisome and stupid"
`` The world is worth nothing ,"
he cried.
`` The whole thing is a stupidity"
The Weathercock was what is called `` used up ;"
The wind had blown down the plank , but the storm had passed over.
-LRB- Illustration : THE WEATHERCOCK.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` What do you think of _ that _ crowing ?"
the Yard Cock inquired of his hens and chickens.
`` It was a little rough -- the elegance was wanting"
And hens and chickens stepped upon the muck-heap , and the Cock strutted to and fro on it like a knight.
`` Garden plant !"
`` Cock-a-doodle-doo !"
he crowed.
`` The chickens will grow up large fowls if I make a noise in the poultry-yard of the world"
No one can stand the sight of a basilisk.
Men know that , and now you know it too -- you know what is in me , and what a cock of the world I am"
They clucked and chirped , so that the Weathercock heard it ; and he heard it , but he never stirred.
`` It 's all stupid stuff !"
said a voice within the Weathercock.
`` The Yard Cock does not lay eggs , and I am too lazy to lay any.
If I liked , I could lay a wind-egg ; but the world is not worth a wind-egg.
And now I do n't like even to sit here any longer"
And with this the Weathercock broke off ; but he did not kill the Yard Cock , though he intended to do so , as the hens declared.
And what does the moral say ? -- `` Better to crow than to be ` used up ' and break off"
The person_0 did not care to take much trouble , and consequently he flew off on a visit to the daisies.
The French call this floweret `` Marguerite ,"
and they know that Marguerite can prophecy , when lovers pluck off its leaves , and ask of every leaf they pluck some question concerning their lovers.
`` Heartily ? Painfully ? Loves me much ? A little ? Not at all ?"
and so on.
Every one asks in his own language.
`` Darling Marguerite daisy !"
he said to her , `` you are the wisest woman among the flowers.
But Marguerite did not answer him.
She was angry that he had called her a `` woman ,"
when she was yet a girl ; and there is a great difference.
It was in the beginning of spring ; the crocus and the snowdrop were blooming around.
`` They are very pretty ,"
thought the person_0.
`` Charming little lasses , but a little too much of the schoolgirl about them"
Like all young lads , he looked out for the elder girls.
Then he flew of to the anemones.
He was just about to make his offer , when close by the maiden he saw a pod at whose end hung a withered flower.
`` Who is that ?"
he asked.
`` That is my sister ,"
replied the Pease Blossom.
`` Oh , indeed ; and you will get to look like her !"
he said.
And away he flew , for he felt quite shocked.
The honeysuckle hung forth blooming from the hedge , but there was a number of girls like that , with long faces and sallow complexions.
No , he did not like her.
And now the flowers appeared in their most gorgeous robes , but in vain ; they had not the fresh fragrant air of youth.
`` I shall take her ,"
said the person_0.
And he made an offer for her.
But the mint stood silent and stiff , listening to him.
At last she said , `` Friendship , if you please ; but nothing more.
And thus it happened that the person_0 had no wife at all.
He had been too long choosing , and that is a bad plan.
So the person_0 became what we call an old bachelor.
It was late in autumn , with rain and cloudy weather.
The wind blew cold over the backs of the old willow trees , so that they creaked again.
It was no weather to be flying about in summer clothes , nor , indeed , was the person_0 in the open air.
He had got under shelter by chance , where there was fire in the stove and the heat of summer.
He could live well enough , but he said , `` It 's not enough merely to live.
One must have freedom , sunshine , and a little flower"
`` Now I am perched on a stalk , like the flowers ,"
said the person_0.
`` It certainly is not very pleasant.
It must be something like being married , for one is stuck fast"
And he consoled himself in some measure with the thought.
`` That 's very poor comfort ,"
said the potted Plants in the room.
`` But ,"
thought the person_0 , `` one can not well trust these potted Plants.
They 've had too much to do with mankind"
THE same in other words , I 've often said ; ` Tis right , at times , disguise with care to spread.
The maxim 's good , and with it I agree : My motto ever is -- VARIETY.
A CERTAIN spouse the same devise had got , Whose wife by all was thought a handsome lot.
HIS words were always gilt ; -LRB- impressive tongue ! -RRB- To gilded words will sure success belong.
He followed e ` en , ` tis said , the other 's plan -- And , thence his dishes to exchange began.
BLITHE Damon for her having felt the dart , The belle received the offer of his heart ; So well he managed and expressed his flame.
That soon her lord and master he became , By Hymen 's right divine , you may conceive , And nothing short of it you should believe.
I have howe'er experienced other flame ; The fault 's acknowledged : I confess my shame.
Though each was conscious , if the truth were known ; The ridicule in turn might be his own.
No doubt my pages nice advice supply ; Is ` t what I 've followed ? -- No , you may rely !"
Or , on your shoulders further I propose , To give you , with a cudgel , thirty blows.
Or , if more pleasing , that you truly pay , The sum of thirty pounds without delay.
Nor can I suffer on my tender back , That , with a cudgel , thirty blows you thwack.
Still harder thirty pounds to pay appeared ; Uncertain how to act , he hanging feared.
The noble peer he begged , upon his knees , His penitence to hear , and sentence ease.
But mercy dwelled not with the angry lord Is this , cried he , the answer ? -- bring a cord.
The peasant , trembling lest his life was sought ; The garlick chose , which presently was brought.
UPON a dish my lord the number told ; Clod no way liked the garlick to behold.
In short , when at the twelfth our wight arrived , He thought his mouth and throat of skin deprived.
All useless proved : -- the full demand he sent , With which the peer expressed himself content.
THERE was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier , conducted himself bravely , and was always the foremost when it rained bullets.
The soldier had nothing left but his gun ; he took that on his shoulder , and went forth into the world.
`` I have no money ,"
`` I know already what thou art in need of ,"
`` A soldier and fear -- how can those two things go together ?"
he answered ; `` thou canst put me to the proof"
`` Very well , then ,"
answered the man , `` look behind thee"
The soldier turned round , and saw a large bear , which came growling towards him.
`` Oho !"
cried the soldier , `` I will tickle thy nose for thee , so that thou shalt soon lose thy fancy for growling ,"
and he aimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle ; it fell down and never stirred again.
`` I see quite well ,"
said the stranger , `` that thou art not wanting in courage , but there is still another condition which thou wilt have to fulfil"
`` If it does not endanger my salvation ,"
replied the soldier , who knew very well who was standing by him.
`` If it does , I 'll have nothing to do with it"
`` Thou wilt look to that for thyself ,"
I will give thee a coat and a cloak , which during this time thou must wear.
After this the Devil vanished.
The soldier put the coat on , felt at once in the pocket , and found that the thing was really true.
During the first year his appearance was passable , but during the second he began to look like a monster.
Bearskin was , however , obliged to promise not to let himself be seen , lest the inn should get a bad name.
He had a compassionate heart , so he opened the door , and saw an old man weeping bitterly , and wringing his hands.
Bearskin went nearer , but the man sprang to his feet and tried to escape from him.
`` If that is your only trouble ,"
said Bearskin , `` I have plenty of money"
He caused the innkeeper to be brought thither , paid him and put a purse full of gold into the poor old man 's pocket besides.
When the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did not know how to be grateful enough.
`` Come with me ,"
said he to Bearskin ; `` my daughters are all miracles of beauty , choose one of them for thyself as a wife.
When she hears what thou hast done for me , she will not refuse thee.
Thou dost in truth look a little strange , but she will soon put thee to rights again"
This pleased Bearskin well , and he went.
When the eldest saw him she was so terribly alarmed at his face that she screamed and ran away.
If it were nothing but ugliness , I might get used to that"
He took a ring from his finger , broke it in two , and gave her one half , the other he kept for himself.
But pray to God to preserve my life"
The poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black , and when she thought of her future bridegroom , tears came into her eyes.
Nothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters.
`` Take care ,"
said the eldest , `` if thou givest him thy hand , he will strike his claws into it"
`` Beware !"
said the second.
`` Bears like sweet things , and if he takes a fancy to thee , he will eat thee up"
`` Thou must always do as he likes ,"
began the elder again , `` or else he will growl"
And the second continued , `` But the wedding will be a merry one , for bears dance well"
The bride was silent , and did not let them vex her.
`` We have not got so far as that yet ,"
answered Bearskin , `` thou must first make me clean"
Whether the Devil liked it or not , he was forced to fetch water , and wash Bearskin , comb his hair , and cut his nails.
After this , he looked like a brave soldier , and was much handsomer than he had ever been before.
When the Devil had gone away , Bearskin was quite lighthearted.
No one recognized him , the father took him for a distinguished general , and led him into the room where his daughters were sitting.
The bride , however , sat opposite to him in her black dress , and never raised her eyes , nor spoke a word.
She took the wine , but when she had drunk it , and found the half ring lying at the bottom , her heart began to beat.
He went up to her , embraced her , and gave her a kiss.
One of them drowned herself in the well , the other hanged herself on a tree.
Where'er he trod , grim death and horror reigned ; At length , the round the noble Hispal gained.
The ships , for want of pilots at the helm , At random drifted over Neptune 's realm.
To mitigate the smart let 's try anew ; In such a place as this few joys accrue.
But Cupid drew her thoughts to higher things , Than merely graving what from fancy springs.
Alaciel blame , or not -- I 've many known , With less excuses , who 've like favors shown.
BY one of early years the troop was led , A handsome lad , and elegantly bred.
He landed with his party near the park.
And these in two divided ere 'twas dark.
-- The princess of his folly made a jest.
He fasted one whole day ; she-tried in vain To make him from the enterprise refrain.
AT length , the second day she ` gan to feel , And strong emotion scarcely could conceal.
What ! let a person die her charms could save ! 'Twas cruel , thus to treat a youth so brave.
OF ` T what we would not , we 're obliged to do , When fate our steps with rigor will pursue.
No folly greater than to heighten pain , When we are sensible relief is vain.
What she , through pity , to another gave , Might well be granted when herself ` twould save.
AT length she yielded to this suitor rude : -- No grief so great , but what may be subdued.
Another thing , howe'er : -- I wish to hang The pirate instantly , before his gang.
THIS speech so well succeeded to inspire , That scarcely could the men retain their ire.
THE evening came , the party soon arrived ; They ate not much , but drink their rage revived.
Give me as much , said one the other week , And see if I 'd a neighbour 's kindness seek.
Through Morpheus ' sleepy pow ` r , and Bacchus ' wine : Our host , at length , completed his design.
A NIGHT thus passed , the wily lover said , Must surely give a license to your bed.
The princess thought the same ; but our gallant , Soon cloyed , for other conquests ` gan to pant.
SHE followed his advice : avenged the wrong ; And naught omitted , pleasures to prolong.
If he obtained his wishes from the fair , The host about it scarcely seemed to care.
THE lover , now convinced that he was feared ; In dark designs upon her persevered.
I 'll freely say , howe'er , that I regard , My services enough to claim reward.
THINGS thus arranged , the fair behind the knight Got up at once , and with him took to flight.
THE treaty was most faithfully observed ; No calculation wrong ; from naught they swerved.
The safest rule 's to be upon your guard ; Fear ev ` ry guile ; yet hope the full reward.
SWEET , charming FAIR , your characters revere ; The Mamolin 's a bird not common here.
YOUR friendships may be very chaste and pure , But strangely Cupid 's lessons will allure.
Defeat his wiles ; resist his tempting charms E ` en from suspicion suffer not alarms.
Do n't laugh at my advice ; ` twere like the boys , Who better might amuse themselves with toys.
`` That was a remarkably fine dinner yesterday ,"
observed an old person_1 of the female sex to another who had not been at the festive gathering.
`` I sat number twenty-one from the old mouse king , so that I was not badly placed.
There was as much joviality and agreeable jesting as in the family circle.
Nothing was left but the pegs at the ends of the sausages.
Every one had heard the proverb , but no one had ever tasted the sausage-peg soup , much less prepared it.
A capital toast was drunk to the inventor of the soup , and it was said he deserved to be a relieving officer.
`` That was not at all bad ,"
said the other person_1 ; `` but how does one prepare this soup ?"
`` Ah , how is it prepared ? That is just what all the young female mice , and the old ones too , are asking.
But every one has not the gift of leaving the family circle and the chimney corner.
In foreign parts one ca n't get cheese-rinds and bacon every day.
No , one must bear hunger , and perhaps be eaten up alive by a cat"
Such were probably the considerations by which the majority were deterred from going out into the wide world and gaining information.
Only four mice announced themselves ready to depart.
They were young and brisk , but poor.
Every one took a sausage-peg , so as to keep in mind the object of the journey.
The stiff sausage-peg was to be to them as a pilgrim 's staff.
The fourth did not report herself , nor was there any intelligence of her , though the day of trial was close at hand.
`` Yes , there 's always some drawback in even the pleasantest affair ,"
said the person_1.
And then he gave orders that all mice within a circuit of many miles should be invited.
No one was to proclaim his opinion till the mouse king had settled what was to be said.
And now let us hear.
_ What the first little person_1 had seen and learned in her travels.
_ `` When I went out into the wide world ,"
Years must pass before one gets so far.
I went to sea at once.
I went in a ship that steered towards the north.
One has delicate living on board ; but one does not learn to prepare soup on a sausage-peg.
We sailed along for many days and nights ; the ship rocked fearfully , and we did not get off without a wetting.
When we at last reached the port to which we were bound , I left the ship ; and it was high up in the far north.
I saw great pathless forests of pine and birch , which smelt so strong that I sneezed , and thought of sausage.
There were great lakes there too.
When I came close to them the waters were quite clear , but from a distance they looked black as ink.
They belong to the goose family -- one can see that by their walk ; for no one can deny his parentage.
I kept with my own kind.
Men and maids danced round the tree , and sang as loudly as they could , to the violin of the fiddler.
`` All at once , the most charming little people came marching forth.
They were only tall enough to reach to my knee.
` I will lend it , ' I said , ` but not to keep.
'"
And now came the real great party of elves.
I fancied also that I heard the voice of the cuckoo and the blackbird , and at last the whole forest seemed to join in.
I should never have believed that so much could come out of it ; but that depends very much upon the hands into which it falls.
I was quite touched.
I wept , as a little mouse may weep , with pure pleasure.
`` The night was far too short ; but it is not longer up yonder at that season.
` How _ we _ do it ? ' asked the chief of the elves , with a smile.
` Why , you have just seen it.
I fancy you hardly knew your sausage-peg again ? '"
` You only mean that as a joke ,"
I replied.
That would be a dish that could only be put on the table when the guests had dined.
' -LRB- Illustration : THE ELVES APPLY FOR THE LOAN OF THE SAUSAGE-PEG.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Then the elf dipped his little finger into the cup of a blue violet , and said to me :"
And so I think I 've given you something to carry home , and a little more than something ! '"
But before the little person_1 said what this `` something more"
`` But what was the ` something more , ' of which you spoke ?"
asked the person_1.
`` Why ,"
the little person_1 answered , `` I think it is what they call effect !"
` Violets , ' the elf said to me , ` are for sight , and smell , and touch.
Therefore it yet remains to provide for hearing and taste ! '"
The fire-shovel hammered upon the brass kettle , and then , on a sudden , all was quiet again.
Oh ! it became so terrible , that the little person_1 lost her stick at last.
`` That was a heavy soup !"
said the person_1.
`` Shall we not soon hear about the preparation ?"
`` That was all ,"
said the little person_1 , with a bow.
`` That is all ! Then we should be glad to hear what the next has to relate ,"
said the person_1.
_ What the second little person_1 had to tell.
_ `` I was born in the palace library ,"
said the second person_1.
We have indeed often been compelled to suffer hunger in the library , but we got a good deal of knowledge.
' She asked me if I were a poet.
I felt quite innocent on the subject , and then she told me I must go out , and manage to become one.
' `` And I went forth , and marched towards the west , away into the world , to become a poet.
`` Understanding is the most important thing in every affair.
I knew that , for the two other things are not held in half such respect , and consequently I went out first to seek understanding.
`` The ants are a respectable people.
They are understanding itself.
Everything with them is like a well-worked sum , that comes right.
They were divided into the clean and the dirty ants.
She spoke so much , and it was all so clever , that it sounded to me like nonsense.
I saw ,"
continued the little person_1 , `` that the ants were always running to and fro with their eggs on their backs.
One of them once dropped her egg ; she exerted herself greatly to pick it up again , but she could not succeed.
` These two qualities , ' she said , ` place us ants on the highest step among all reasoning beings.
Understanding is seen among us all in predominant measure , and I have the greatest share of understanding.
' And so saying , she raised herself on her hind-legs , so that she was easily to be recognized.
I could not be mistaken , and I ate her up.
It was an oak , and had a great trunk , and a far-spreading top , and was very old.
I knew that a living being dwelt here , a Dryad as it is called , who is born with the tree , and dies with it.
I had heard about this in the library ; and now I saw an oak tree , and an oak girl.
She uttered a piercing cry when she saw me so near.
I accosted the maiden in a friendly and honest way , and bade her take courage.
said the little person_1.
`` I put it in water , and held it there till it grew soft.
It was very hard to digest , but I nibbled it up at last.
It is very easy to gnaw oneself into being a poet , though there are many things one must do.
I said so to myself , and told the others also.
I had headache , and chestache , and I ca n't tell what aches besides.
I shall therefore be able to wait upon you every day with a poem or a history -- and that 's the soup I have to offer"
`` Let us hear what the third has to say ,"
was now the person_1 's command.
`` Peep ! peep !"
She toppled the sausage-peg with the crape covering over in a moment.
And let us hear what she said.
-LRB- Illustration : THE GAOLER 'S GRANDDAUGHTER TAKES PITY ON THE LITTLE MOUSE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa _ What the fourth person_1 , who spoke before the third had spoken , had to tell.
_ `` I betook myself immediately to the largest town ,"
she said ; `` the name has escaped me -- I have a bad memory for names.
The gaoler was talking of his prisoners , and especially of one who had spoken unconsidered words.
These words had given rise to others , and these latter had been written down and recorded"
` The whole thing is soup on a sausage-peg , ' said the gaoler ; ` but the soup may cost him his neck.
' `` Now , this gave me an interest in the prisoner ,"
continued the person_1 , `` and I watched my opportunity and slipped into his prison -- for there 's a mouse-hole to be found behind every locked door.
The prisoner looked pale , and had a great beard , and bright sparkling eyes.
The lamp flickered and smoked , but the walls were so accustomed to that , that they grew none the blacker for it.
The prisoner scratched pictures and verses in white upon the black ground , but I did not read them.
I think he found it tedious , and I was a welcome guest.
I really got to love him , for these things are reciprocal.
_ I _ stayed , but _ he _ did not stay.
I do n't know his history"
` Soup on a sausage-peg ! ' said the gaoler , to whom I now went ; but I should not have trusted him.
He took me in his hand , certainly , but he popped me into a cage , a treadmill.
That 's a horrible engine , in which you go round and round without getting any farther ; and people laugh at you into the bargain.
Free ! free ! I thought only of that , and not of the goal of my journey.
`` It was dark , and night was coming on.
I took up my quarters in an old tower , where dwelt a watchman and an owl.
That is a creature like a cat , who has the great failing that she eats mice.
Her conduct inspired me with so much confidence , that from the crack in which I was crouching I called out ` peep ! ' to her.
'"
` Nothing ! '"
I exclaimed.
`` I was quite struck.
Truth is not always agreeable , but truth is above everything ; and that 's what the old owl said.
The mice are an enlightened people , and the king is above them all.
He is capable of making me queen , for the sake of truth"
`` Your truth is a falsehood ,"
said the person_1 who had not yet spoken.
`` I can prepare the soup , and I mean to prepare it"
_ How it was prepared.
_ `` I did not travel ,"
the third person_1 said.
`` I remained in my country -- that 's the right thing to do.
There 's no necessity for traveling ; one can get everything as good here.
I stayed at home.
I 've not learned what I know from supernatural beings , or gobbled it up , or held converse with owls.
I have what I know through my own reflections.
It costs nothing at all -- no further materials are necessary , only stir it round !"
`` Can not any one else do that ?"
asked the person_1.
`` No ;"
replied the mouse.
`` The power is contained only in the tail of the person_1"
`` Of course -- certainly you are my queen ,"
he said.
-LRB- Illustration : THE MOUSE KING UNDERSTANDS HOW THE SOUP IS MADE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa And soon the wedding was held.
They said that some of the stories had been very cleverly told ; but the whole thing might have been different"
_ I _ should have told it so -- and so -- and so !"
Thus said the critics , who are always wise -- after the fact.
And this story went out into the wide world , everywhere ; and opinions varied concerning it , but the story remained as it was.
And that 's the best in great things and in small , so also with regard to soup on a sausage-peg -- not to expect any thanks for it"
Everything was like a wide , blooming meadow , or like the most charming garden.
Each tower was reared in the form of a lily.
Just as much splendor , though in another way , appeared below , in the wide halls of the castle.
Here , on the walls , the whole world around was reflected.
One saw everything that was done , so that there was no necessity of reading any papers , and indeed papers were not obtainable there.
His name is very difficult -- you will not be able to pronounce it ; therefore it may remain unmentioned.
He also , however high he might tower above men in wisdom , must die one day.
He knew that , and his children also must fade away like the leaves of the forest , and become dust.
`` What happens to man ?"
the wise man asked himself , `` when the angel of death touches him ? What may death be ? The body is dissolved -- and the soul.
Thither ?"
repeated the wise man , and fixed his eyes upon the moon and the stars ; `` up yonder ?"
Leaf for leaf , the wise man read it through : every man may read in this book , but only by fragments.
The wiser a man becomes , the more he will read ; and the wisest read most.
But in the division of the book whose title is `` Life after Death"
not even one point was to be distinctly seen.
That pained him.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa Like the wise King Solomon , he understood the language of the animals , and could interpret their talk and their songs.
But that made him none the wiser.
The Book of Truth lay before him with leaves that appeared blank.
Never had the sons gone farther from the castle than the branches of the tree extended , nor had the sister strayed from home.
They were happy children in the land of childhood -- in the beautiful fragrant person_1 of the person_0.
existed.
Five senses have been given corporeally and mentally , inwardly and outwardly , to body and soul.
The children reflected deeply upon these things ; they meditated upon them by day and by night.
Then the eldest of the brothers dreamt a splendid dream.
But the sister dreamt nothing about going out into the wide world.
It never entered her mind.
Her world was her father 's house.
`` I shall ride forth into the wide world ,"
said the eldest brother.
`` I must try what life is like there , and go to and fro among men.
I will practice only the good and the true ; with these I will protect the beautiful.
Much shall change for the better when I am there"
In the case of the eldest this pre-eminent sense was Sight.
This was to do him especial service.
Stags and antelopes escorted him to the boundary of his home towards the west , and there the wild swans received him and flew north-west.
He followed them.
He wished to go thoroughly and honestly to work in the understanding of the beautiful , the true , and the good.
It was the same thing everywhere.
`` I see I must attack these things vigorously ,"
he said ; and attacked them with vigor accordingly.
But while he was looking for the truth , came the Evil One , the father of lies.
`` Over !"
said the wild swan , who flew across the sea towards the east.
`` Over !"
twittered the swallows , who likewise flew eastward , towards the person_1 of the person_0.
That was no good news that they carried to the young man 's home.
`` I fancy the _ Seer _ must have fared badly ,"
said the second brother ; `` but the _ Hearer _ may have better fortune"
For this one possessed the sense of hearing in an eminent degree : he could hear the grass grow , so quick was he to hear.
He took a hearty leave of all at home , and rode away , provided with good abilities and good intentions.
The swallows escorted him , and he followed the swans ; and he stood far from his home in the wide world.
But he experienced the fact that one may have too much of a good thing.
His hearing was _ too _ fine.
He not only heard the grass grow , but could hear every man 's heart beat , in sorrow and in joy.
The whole world was to him like a great clockmaker 's workshop , wherein all the clocks were going `` tick , tick !"
and all the turret clocks striking `` ding dong !"
It was unbearable.
For a long time his ears held out , but at last all the noise and screaming became too much , for one man.
Heaven help us ! He thrust his fingers deeper and deeper into his ears , but at last the drums burst.
The birds who winged their flight towards the east brought tidings of this , till the news reached the castle in the person_1 of the person_0"
_ I _ will try now !"
said the third brother.
`` I have a sharp _ nose _ !"
Now that was not said in very good taste ; but it was his way , and one must take him as he was.
`` I can smell fire !"
`` Every fragrant spot in the realm of the beautiful has its frequenters ,"
he said.
Another prefers sitting among the overpowering scent of jessamine , or scenting himself with strong clove oil.
This man seeks out the fresh sea breeze , while that one climbs to the highest mountain top and looks down upon the busy little life beneath"
Thus he spake.
It seemed to him as if he had already been out in the world , as if he had already associated with men and known them.
But this experience arose from within himself : it was the poet within him , the gift of Heaven , and bestowed on him in his cradle.
He bade farewell to his paternal roof in the person_1 of the person_0 , and departed on foot through the pleasant scenery of home.
`` I will give my seal to the flower ,"
said the Snail ; `` I have spit at it , and I can do no more for it"
`` Thus it always fares with the beautiful in this world !"
said the poet ; and he sang a song concerning it , sang it in his own way ; but nobody listened.
Then the poet sang several songs of the beautiful , the true , and the good.
It appeared as if this brother was to have better fortune than the two others.
But when the little birds heard of this they mourned , and for three days they sang not one song.
The black wood-snail became blacker still , not for grief , but for envy.
`` They should have strewed incense for me ,"
That 's the usual way ! -LRB- Illustration : THE DEPARTURE OF THE THIRD BROTHER.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Now I shall have to go out into the world , to disappear like the rest ,"
said the fourth brother.
He had just as good a wit as the third , but he was no poet , though he could be witty.
Those two had filled the castle with cheerfulness , and now the last cheerfulness was going away.
Every man was to him a vessel in which something was seething , every country an enormous kitchen , a kitchen of the mind.
`` That was no delicacy ,"
he said , and he wanted to go out and try what was delicate.
`` Perhaps fortune may be more favourable to me than it was to my brothers ,"
he said.
`` I shall start on my travels.
But what conveyance shall I choose ? Are air balloons invented yet ?"
he asked his father , who knew of all inventions that had been made , or that were to be made.
But air balloons had not yet been invented , nor steam ships , nor railways.
`` Good : then I shall choose an air balloon ,"
he said ; `` my father knows how they are made and guided.
Nobody has invented them yet , and consequently the people will believe that it is an aerial phantom.
And he obtained what he wanted , and flew away.
The birds accompanied him farther than they had flown with the other brothers.
The air became black with birds , they came on like a cloud -- like the cloud of locusts over the land of Egypt.
Now he was out in the wide world.
The balloon descended over one of the greatest cities , and the aeronaut took up his station on the highest point , on the church steeple.
Then he sat on the church steeple.
The birds no longer hovered around him , they had got tired of him , and he was tired of them.
All the chimneys in the town were smoking merrily.
`` Those are altars erected to thy honor !"
said the Wind , who wished to say something agreeable to him.
He sat boldly up there , and looked down upon the people in the street.
`` Vanity ! I must hasten downward , dip my finger in the pot , and taste !"
he said.
`` But for awhile I will still sit here , for the wind blows so pleasantly against my back.
I 'll sit here so long as the wind blows.
I 'll enjoy a slight rest.
` It is good to sleep long in the morning , when one has much to do , ' says the lazy man.
I 'll stop here so long as this wind blows , for it pleases me"
`` It goes not well with them ,"
said the father ; `` they will never bring the gleaming jewel home ; it is not made for me ; they are gone , they are dead !"
With kindly longing she thought of her brothers.
She had wetted them with her tears , and the twist was strong as a cable.
She rose , and her resolution was taken : the dream must be made a reality.
It was night , and her father slept.
She pressed a kiss on his hand , and then took her distaff , and fastened the end of the thread to her father 's house.
How would she fare out yonder , she , the poor blind child ? But she had the invisible thread to which she could hold fast.
She possessed a gift which all the others lacked.
She heard the song of the birds , and smelt the scent of orange groves and apple orchards so strongly that she seemed to taste it.
Soft tones and charming songs reached her ear , but also howling and roaring , and thoughts and opinions , sounded in strange contradiction to each other.
Into the innermost depths of her heart penetrated the echoes of human thoughts and feelings.
One chorus sounded darkly -- `` The life of earth is a shadow vain A night created for sorrow !"
but then came another strain -- `` The life of earth is the scent of the rose , With its sunshine and its pleasure"
And if one strophe sounded painfully -- `` Each mortal thinks of himself alone , This truth has been manifested"
-- on the other side the answer pealed forth -- `` A mighty stream of warmest love , All through the world shall guide us"
She heard , indeed , the words -- `` In the little petty whirl here below , Each thing shows mean and paltry ;"
but then came also the comfort -- `` Many things great and good are achieved , That the ear of man heareth never"
and if sometimes the mocking strain sounded around her -- `` Join in the common cry : with a jest Destroy the good gifts of the Giver"
in the blind girl 's heart a stronger voice repeated -- `` To trust in thyself and in God is best ; His good will be done for ever"
-LRB- Illustration : THE BLIND GIRL 'S MESSENGERS.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa But the evil spirit could not see this and be content.
He has more cunning than ten thousand men , and he found out a way to compass his end.
sung the blind girl , in full faith.
From the forehead of humanity it would gleam even to the castle of her father.
`` Even to my father 's house ,"
she repeated.
`` Yes , the place of the jewel is on earth , and I shall bring more than the promise of it with me.
I feel its glow , it swells more and more in my closed hand.
I took the sound of the beating heart engaged in what is good , and added it to the first.
All that I bring is but dust , but still it is the dust of the jewel we seek , and in plenty.
I have my whole hand full of it"
And she stretched forth her hand towards her father.
`` It will be blown away by the wind !"
said the father , and he seized the hand she had opened.
`` No ,"
she replied , with quiet confidence , `` it can not be blown away ; I feel the beam warming my very soul"
And with the father and daughter were again the four brothers.
When the green leaf fell upon the bosom of each , a longing for home had seized them , and led them back.
They had arrived.
Thus , from the leaf of the book with the beaming word"
_ Believe _ ,"
_ Believe _"
the bridge of _ Hope _ arose , spanning the distance , even to the immeasurable love in the realms of the Infinite"
Now , Farmer Green and his hired man had not chopped long before they stopped to breathe.
The tree no longer shook.
And Fatty felt better at once.
You see , he thought that the men would go away , just as Johnnie had gone away the night before.
But they had no such idea at all.
`` Which way are you going to fell her ?"
the hired man asked.
He said HER , meaning the TREE , of course.
`` That way !"
said Farmer Green , pointing toward the woods.
`` We 'll have to drop her that way , or she 'll fall right across the road , and of course THAT would never do"
`` But will she clear the trees on the edge of the woods ?"
The hired man appeared somewhat doubtful.
`` Oh , to be sure -- to be sure !"
answered Farmer Green.
And with that they set to work again.
But this time they both chopped on the same side of the tree -- the side toward the woods.
Now , if Fatty Coon was frightened before , you will believe that he was still more frightened when the big chestnut tree began to sag.
Yes ! it began to lean toward the woods.
Slowly , slowly it tipped.
And Fatty was scared half out of his mind.
He climbed to the very top of the tree , because he wanted to get just as far away from those men as he could.
And there he waited.
There was nothing else he could do.
Yes ! he waited until that awful moment should come when the tree would go crashing down upon the ground.
What was going to happen to him then ? Fatty wondered.
And while he was wondering there sounded all at once a great snapping and splitting.
And Fatty felt the tree falling , falling.
He could hear Johnnie Green shouting.
And he shut his eyes and held fast to his branch.
Then came the crash.
When Fatty Coon opened his eyes he expected to see Johnnie Green all ready to seize him.
But to his great surprise he was still far above the ground.
You see , Farmer Green had been mistaken.
Either the big chestnut tree was taller than he had guessed , or the woods were nearer than he had thought.
For instead of dropping upon the ground , Fatty 's tree had fallen right against another tree on the edge of the woods.
And there it lay , half-tipped over , with its branches caught fast in the branches of that other tree.
It was no wonder that Johnnie Green shouted.
Fatty was going straight into the woods.
It was no wonder that Johnnie Green shouted.
For he had lost his pet coon.
He had lost him before he ever had him.
And he was sadly disappointed.
But Fatty Coon was not disappointed , for he had not wanted to be a pet at all.
And he was very glad -- you may be sure -- to get safely home once more"
Then said the Jew , `` Grant me my life , I have no money but eight farthings"
But the tailor said , `` Money thou hast ; and it shall be produced ,"
and used violence and beat him until he was near death.
And when the Jew was dying , the last words he said were , `` The bright sun will bring it to light ,"
and thereupon he died.
The tailor 's apprentice felt in his pockets and sought for money , but he found nothing but eight farthings , as the Jew had said.
Then he took him up and carried him behind a clump of trees , and went onwards to seek work.
Then the tailor looked up and said , `` Yes , it would like very much to bring it to light , and can not !"
The woman said , `` Oh , dear husband , and what is that , then ?"
`` What dost thou mean by that ?"
He answered , `` I must not tell thee"
But she said , `` If thou lovest me , thou must tell me ,"
and used her most affectionate words , and said that no one should ever know it , and left him no rest.
After this , he again charged her particularly never to tell this , or he would lose his life , and she did promise.
And thus , after all , the bright sun did bring it to light"
It was the very next night after old dog Spot had treed Fatty Coon in the big oak near the cornfield.
They had finished their evening meal at Farmer person_0 's house.
The cows were milked , the horses had been fed , the chickens had all gone to roost.
And Farmer person_0 looked up at the moon , rising from behind Blue Mountain.
`` We 'll go coon-hunting again to-night ,"
he said to Johnnie and the hired man.
`` The corn has brought the coons up from the swamp.
We 'll start as soon as it grows a little darker"
Well -- after a while they set out for the cornfield.
And sure enough ! old Spot soon began to bark.
`` He 's treed !"
said Farmer person_0 , pretty soon.
And they all hurried over to the edge of the woods , where Spot had chased a coon up into a tall chestnut tree.
In the moonlight they could see the coon quite plainly.
`` Another little feller !"
cried Farmer person_0.
`` I declare , all the coons that come to the cornfield seem to be young ones.
This one 's no bigger than the one we saw last night"
Now , although Farmer person_0 never guessed it , it was Fatty Coon who was up there in the tall chestnut.
He had run almost to the woods this time , before he had to take to a tree.
But there were no trees near enough the big chestnut for that.
Fatty had to stay right there and wait for those men to pass on.
He was n't afraid.
He felt perfectly safe in his big tree.
And he only smiled when Johnnie person_0 said to his father -- `` I wish I had that young coon.
He 'd make a fine pet"
`` A pet !"
exclaimed Farmer person_0.
`` You remember that pet fox you had , that stole my chickens ?"
`` Oh , I 'd be careful ,"
Johnnie promised.
`` Besides , do n't you think we ought to catch him , so he wo n't eat any more corn ?"
Farmer person_0 smiled.
`` All right !"
he said at last.
`` I 'll give you one more chance , Johnnie.
But you 'll have to see that this young coon does n't kill any of my poultry"
Johnnie promised that nothing of the sort should happen.
The great tree shook as if it knew that it would soon come crashing down upon the ground.
And as for Fatty Coon , he could not see but that he must fall when the tree did.
He , too , shivered and shook.
And he wrapped himself all the way around a limb and hung on as tight as ever he could"
' He awoke with a great sigh , which aroused the princess , who asked him the cause of it.
' The princess communicated the King of China 's consent to person_2 , who was transported with joy to hear it.
The day being unusually hot , person_0 thought it best to encamp there.
They alighted in one of the finest spots , and the prince ordered his servants to pitch their tents , and went himself to give directions.
Desirous to know what it was , he opened the purse , and took out a cornelian , engraven with unknown figures and characters.
Imagine the concern and grief of person_2 when he saw the bird fly away with the talisman.
The bird having got her prize settled on the ground not far off , with the talisman in her mouth.
On the eleventh day the bird continued flying , and came near a great city.
At last he came to the port , in as great uncertainty as ever what he should do.
Walking along the river-side , he perceived the gate of a garden open , and an old gardener at work.
person_0 entered , and , as the gardener bade him shut the door , demanded of the gardener why he was so cautious.
Come in and rest.
Ah ! ' continued he , ` how do I know she is alive ? ' and so saying , he burst into tears.
' person_2 was glad he had met with such a place of refuge , in a place where he had no acquaintances.
He accepted the offer , and lived with the gardener till the time came that the ship was to sail to the Isle of Ebony.
We must leave him in this place , to return to the princess , whom we left asleep in her tent.
They told her they saw him enter the tent , but did not see him go out again.
While they were talking to her , she took up her girdle , found the little purse open , and the talisman gone.
She did not doubt but that person_0 had taken it to see what it was , and that he would bring it back with him.
She waited for him impatiently till night , and could not imagine what made him stay away from her so long.
She only and her women knew of the prince 's being gone ; for his men were asleep in their tents.
They traveled for several months by land and sea ; the princess continuing , the journey under the name of person_0.
They took the Isle of Ebony on their way to the Isles of the Children of Khaledan.
They went to the capital of the Isle of Ebony , where a king reigned whose name was Armanos.
He showed her all possible honor , and entertained her for three days with extraordinary magnificence.
Instead of going home , stay and marry her from my hand , with my crown , which I resign in your favor.
Besides , she was not sure whether she might not find person_2 in the court of King Schahzaman his father.
' The marriage treaty being thus concluded and agreed on , the ceremony was put off till next day.
She talked also to her women , and charged them to continue to keep the secret.
Having said this , he descended from his throne , and the person_1 Badoura , by his order , ascended it.
Pray heaven you may meet with your husband again soon , and be sure that I will religiously keep the secret committed to me.
I only ask of you at present to be your friend.
' Then the two princesses tenderly embraced each other , and after a thousand expressions of mutual friendship lay down to rest.
Their shows are worth seeing.
You will have nothing to do to-day : I leave you here.
' The gardener put on his best clothes , and went out.
person_0 was surprised to behold a furious battle between these two birds , fighting one another with their beaks.
They killed the murderer with their beaks.
They then opened it , tore out the entrails , left the body on the spot unburied , and flew away.
person_0 remained in great astonishment all the time that he stood beholding this sight.
' So saying , he kissed the talisman , wrapped it up in a ribbon , and tied it carefully about his arm.
The good man bade him root up an old tree which bore no fruit.
person_0 took an axe , and began his work.
In cutting off a branch of the root , he found that his axe struck against something that resisted the blow and made a great noise.
He removed the earth , and discovered a broad plate of brass , under which was a staircase of ten steps.
He opened them all , one after another , and there was not one of them which was not full of gold-dust.
He returned with a joyful countenance , by which the prince guessed that he brought him good news.
It suits a prince like you , rather than me : I have one foot in the grave , and am in no want of anything.
' person_2 would not be outdone in generosity by the gardener.
They had a long dispute about it.
At last the prince solemnly protested that he would have none of it , unless the gardener would divide it with him and take half.
The good man , to please the prince , consented ; so they parted it between them , and each had twenty-five urns.
The gardener was equally surprised and joyful to hear it for his sake.
They asked him where the passenger was that was to go with him.
I will only take leave of the gardener , and follow you.
The prince being under the necessity of embarking immediately hastened to pay the last duty to the deceased.
When he came to the port , he was told the ship had sailed several hours before he came and was already out of sight.
It had waited three hours for him , and the wind standing fair , the captain dared not stay any longer.
But the greatest affliction of all was his having let go the person_1 Badoura 's talisman , which he now gave over for lost.
' The princess answered , ` No matter ; bring them ashore ; we will make a bargain for them.
' The captain sent his boat aboard , and in a little time it returned with the pots of olives.
The princess demanded how much the fifty pots might be worth in the Isle of Ebony.
' The money was accordingly , paid , and the pots carried to the palace in her presence.
She opened one , to let the person_1 Haiatalnefous taste them , and poured them into a dish.
Great was her astonishment when she found the olives mingled with gold-dust.
` What can this mean ? ' said she , ` it is wonderful beyond comprehension.
The person_1 Haiatalnefous and her women restored the person_1 Badoura by throwing cold water on her face.
I arranged for his passage with a very old gardener , who told me I should find him in his garden , where he worked under him.
He showed me the place , and for that reason I told your majesty he was poor.
I went there to call him.
I told him what haste I was in , spoke to him myself in the garden , and can not be mistaken in the man.
I have ordered my seal to be put on the warehouses where they are , which shall not be taken off till you bring me that man.
This is all I have to say to you ; go , and do as I command you.
' The captain could make no reply to this order , the disobeying of which would be a very great loss to him and his merchants.
They were so diligent , that he set sail the same day.
He had a prosperous voyage to the city of the idolaters , where he arrived in the night.
Though it was about midnight when he arrived there , the prince was not asleep.
His separation from the fair person_1 of China his wife afflicted him as usual.
He cursed the minute in which his curiosity tempted him to touch the fatal girdle.
Thus did he pass those hours which are devoted to rest , when he heard somebody knock at the garden door.
She told her how she intended to manage to reveal herself to person_2 , and to give him the kingdom.
The person_1 of the Isle of Ebony was so far from betraying her , that she rejoiced and entered fully into the plan.
The next morning the person_1 of China ordered person_2 to be apparelled in the robes of an emir or governor of a province.
He was much more surprised when he heard him praise him so excessively.
Those praises , however , did not disconcert him , though he received them with such modesty as showed that he did not grow vain.
Then the steward of his household brought him a strong box full of gold for his expenses.
person_0 would have been the happiest man in the world , if he had had his princess with him.
She was now known only by the name of the young King Armanos.
She herself also lived under such constraint that she could endure it no longer.
Come hither in the evening , and leave word at home that you will not return ; I will take care to provide you a bed.
' person_0 took the talisman , and drew near a lamp to look at it.
He sat down and asked where the king was.
If your majesty will have the patience to hear both our stories , I hope you will not condemn me for putting an innocent deceit upon you.
' The king bade her go on , and heard her discourse from the beginning to the end with astonishment.
If this precedence was not her due , I would , however , give it her , after she has kept my secret so generously.
' person_0 was proclaimed king , and married the same day with all possible demonstrations of joy.
There were once three apprentices , who had agreed to keep always together while traveling , and always to work in the same town.
And that seemed best to the others also.
They went forth , and met on the way a richly-dressed man who asked who they were.
`` There is no need for that ,"
One of them said , `` If our souls and salvation be not endangered , we will certainly do it"
`` They will not ,"
replied the man , `` I have no claim on you"
As they were now secure , they consented , and the Devil told them what he wanted.
The first was to answer , `` All three of us ,"
to every question ; the second was to say , `` For money ,"
and the third , `` And quite right too !"
`` Yes ,"
said the host , `` that is what I mean"
The second said , `` For money"
`` Of course ,"
said the host.
The third said , `` And quite right too !"
`` Certainly it is right ,"
said the host.
Good meat and drink were now brought to them , and they were well waited on.
After the dinner came the payment , and the innkeeper gave the bill to the one who said , `` All three of us ,"
the second said , `` For money ,"
and the third , `` and quite right too !"
`` Indeed it is right ,"
said the host , `` all three pay , and without money I can give nothing"
They , however , paid still more than he had asked.
The lodgers , who were looking on , said , `` These people must be mad"
`` Yes , indeed they are ,"
said the host , `` they are not very wise"
So they stayed some time in the inn , and said nothing else but , `` All three of us ,"
`` For money ,"
and `` And quite right too !"
But they saw and knew all that was going on.
The host did as he was asked.
As he was carrying the trunk into his room , he felt that it was heavy with gold.
Thereupon he gave the three apprentices a lodging below , but the merchant came up-stairs into a separate apartment.
When it was day there was a great outcry ; the merchant lay dead in bed bathed in blood.
All the guests ran at once but the host said , `` The three crazy apprentices have done this ;"
the lodgers confirmed it , and said , `` It can have been no one else"
The innkeeper , however , had them called , and said to them , `` Have you killed the merchant ?"
`` All three of us ,"
said the first , `` For money ,"
said the second ; and the third added , `` And quite right too !"
`` There now , you hear ,"
said the host , `` they confess it themselves"
They were taken to prison , therefore , and were to be tried.
The next morning they were led to the bar , and the judge said , `` Are you the murderers ?"
`` All three of us"
`` Why did you kill the merchant ?"
`` For money"
`` You wicked wretches , you have no horror of your sins ?"
`` And quite right too !"
`` They have confessed , and are still stubborn ,"
said the judge , `` lead them to death instantly"
So they were taken out , and the host had to go with them into the circle.
Then said the headsman , `` It is a pardon coming ,"
and `` Pardon ! pardon !"
was called from the carriage also.
Then said the eldest , `` We did not kill the merchant , the murderer is standing there in the circle ,"
and he pointed to the innkeeper.
`` In proof of this , go into his cellar , where many others whom he has killed are still hanging"
One of them said to the others , `` If we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows ; how shall we manage it ?"
They crept into the corn , only the troops did not march away , but remained lying all round about it.
Then said they , `` What is the use of our deserting if we have to perish miserably here ?"
`` If you will serve me for seven years ,"
said the dragon , `` I will convey you through the army so that no one shall seize you"
`` We have no choice and are compelled to accept ,"
they replied.
Then he put before them a book which they were all three forced to sign.
`` I will , however , then set you a riddle ,"
said he , `` and if you can guess that , you shall be free , and released from my power"
Wherever they were they lived in pleasure and magnificence , rode on horseback , drove in carriages , ate and drank , but did nothing wicked.
They went out into the open country and sat down , and the two pulled sorrowful faces.
Then an aged woman came up to them who inquired why they were so sad ? `` Alas !"
said they , `` how can that concern you ? After all , you can not help us"
`` Who knows ?"
said she.
`` Confide your trouble to me"
The two melancholy ones thought to themselves , `` That will still not save us ,"
and stayed where they were , but the third , the merry one , got up and walked on in the forest until he found the rock-house.
When the dragon comes , I will question him about the riddle , he tells everything to me , so listen carefully to his answer"
At twelve o'clock at night , the dragon came flying thither , and asked for his dinner.
The grandmother laid the table , and served up food and drink , so that he was pleased , and they ate and drank together.
he answered , `` but I have laid hold of three soldiers , I have them safe"
`` Indeed ! three soldiers , that 's something like , but they may escape you yet"
The person_0 said mockingly , `` They are mine ! I will set them a riddle , which they will never in this world be able to guess !"
`` What riddle is that ?"
she inquired.
`` I will tell you.
When the person_0 had gone to bed , the old grandmother raised up the stone , and let out the soldier.
`` Hast thou paid particular attention to everything ?"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` I know enough , and will contrive to save myself"
Then he had to go back another way , through the window , secretly and with all speed to his companions.
He told them how the person_0 had been overreached by the old grandmother , and how he had learned the answer to the riddle from him.
Then the first soldier began and said , `` In the great North Sea lies a dead dog-fish , that no doubt is the roast meat"
The person_0 was angry , and began to mutter , `` Hm ! hm ! hm !"
And asked the second , `` But what will your spoon be ?"
`` The rib of a whale , that is to be our silver spoon"
The person_0 made a wry face , again growled , `` Hm ! hm ! hm !"
and said to the third , `` And do you also know what your wine-glass is to be ?"
`` An old horse 's hoof is to be our wineglass"
One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food.
The wretch often disguises himself , but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet"
The kids said , `` Dear mother , we will take good care of ourselves ; you may go away without any anxiety"
Then the old one bleated , and went on her way with an easy mind.
But the little kids knew that it was the wolf , by the rough voice ; `` We will not open the door ,"
cried they , `` thou art not our mother.
She has a soft , pleasant voice , but thy voice is rough ; thou art the wolf !"
Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk , ate this and made his voice soft with it.
Then the wolf ran to a baker and said , `` I have hurt my feet , rub some dough over them for me"
And when the baker had rubbed his feet over , he ran to the miller and said , `` Strew some white meal over my feet for me"
The miller thought to himself , `` The wolf wants to deceive someone ,"
and refused ; but the wolf said , `` If thou wilt not do it , I will devour thee"
Then the miller was afraid , and made his paws white for him.
Truly men are like that.
The little kids cried , `` First show us thy paws that we may know if thou art our dear little mother"
But who should come in but the wolf ! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.
But the wolf found them all , and used no great ceremony ; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat.
The youngest , who was in the clock-case , was the only one he did not find.
Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest.
Ah ! What a sight she saw there ! The house-door stood wide open.
She sought her children , but they were nowhere to be found.
She called them one after another by name , but no one answered.
At last , when she came to the youngest , a soft voice cried , `` Dear mother , I am in the clock-case"
She took the kid out , and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others.
Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.
At length in her grief she went out , and the youngest kid ran with her.
When they came to the meadow , there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook.
She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly.
`` Ah , heavens ,"
said she , `` is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper , can be still alive ?"
What rejoicing there was ! They embraced their dear mother , and jumped like a sailor at his wedding.
But when he began to walk and move about , the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled.
Then cried he , `` What rumbles and tumbles Against my poor bones ? I thought ` t was six kids , But it 's naught but big stones"
When the seven kids saw that , they came running to the spot and cried aloud , `` The wolf is dead ! The wolf is dead !"
and danced for joy round about the well with their mother"
`` Thunder and lightning ,"
cried the tailor , `` what is that ?"
and as he was strongly goaded by curiosity , he went boldly towards it.
`` What dost thou want here , thou tiny fly 's leg ?"
cried the giant , with a voice as if it were thundering on every side.
The tailor whimpered , `` I want just to look about and see if I can earn a bit of bread for myself , in this forest"
`` If that is what thou art after ,"
said the giant , `` thou mayst have a place with me"
`` If it must be , why not ? What wages shall I receive ?"
`` Thou shalt hear what wages thou shalt have.
Every year three hundred and sixty-five days , and when it is leap-year , one more into the bargain.
Does that suit thee ?"
`` All right ,"
On this the giant said to him , `` Go , little ragamuffin , and fetch me a jug of water"
`` Had I not better bring the well itself at once , and the spring too ?"
asked the boaster , and went with the pitcher to the water.
`` What ! the well and the spring too ,"
growled the giant in his beard , for he was rather clownish and stupid , and began to be afraid.
`` That knave is not a fool , he has a wizard in his body.
Be on thy guard , old Hans , this is no serving-man for thee"
`` Why not the whole forest , at once , with one stroke.
The whole forest , young and old , with all that is there , both rough and smooth ?"
asked the little tailor , and went to cut the wood.
growled the credulous giant in his beard , and was still more terrified.
`` The knave can do much more than bake apples , and has a wizard in his body.
Be on thy guard , old Hans , this is no serving-man for thee !"
When the tailor had brought the wood , the giant commanded him to shoot two or three wild boars for supper.
`` Why not rather a thousand at one shot , and bring them all here ?"
inquired the ostentatious tailor.
`` What !"
cried the timid giant in great terror ; `` Let well alone to-night , and lie down to rest"
Time brings counsel.
Next morning the giant and the tailor went to a marsh , round which stood a number of willow-trees.
All at once the tailor was sitting on it , holding his breath , and making himself so heavy that the bough bent down.
If the tailor has not fallen down again , he must be hovering about in the air"
One day an old man and his wife were sitting in front of a miserable house resting a while from their work.
Suddenly a splendid carriage with four black horses came driving up , and a richly-dressed man descended from it.
He had dug some holes in the garden , and now wanted to plant some trees in them.
`` Have you no children ,"
asked the stranger , `` who could help you with your work ?"
`` No ,"
answered the peasant , `` I had a son , it is true , but it is long since he went out into the world.
`` But tell me ,"
That tree there is old , and mis-shapen , no one can make it straight now.
Trees must be trained while they are young"
`` That is how it was with your son ,"
`` Truly it is a long time since he went away ,"
replied the old man , `` he must have changed"
`` Would you know him again if he were to come to you ?"
asked the stranger.
`` Hardly by his face ,"
replied the peasant , `` but he has a mark about him , a birth-mark on his shoulder , that looks like a bean"
When he had said that the stranger pulled off his coat , bared his shoulder , and showed the peasant the bean.
`` Good God !"
cried the old man , `` Thou art really my son !"
and love for his child stirred in his heart.
`` But ,"
`` Ah , father ,"
How have I got all that ? I have become a thief , but do not be alarmed , I am a master-thief.
For me there are neither locks nor bolts , whatsoever I desire is mine.
Do not imagine that I steal like a common thief , I only take some of the superfluity of the rich.
Poor people are safe , I would rather give to them than take anything from them.
It is the same with anything which I can have without trouble , cunning and dexterity I never touch it"
`` Alas , my son ,"
said the father , `` it still does not please me , a thief is still a thief , I tell thee it will end badly"
At length she said , `` Even if he has become a thief , he is still my son , and my eyes have beheld him once more"
They sat down to table , and once again he ate with his parents the wretched food which he had not eaten for so long.
`` Be easy , father , he will do me no harm , for I understand my trade.
I will go to him myself this very day"
When evening drew near , the master-thief seated himself in his carriage , and drove to the castle.
The count received him civilly , for he took him for a distinguished man.
When , however , the stranger made himself known , the count turned pale and was quite silent for some time.
`` Lord count ,"
Mark what I am saying , for thy life depends on it"
The master-thief went to the nearest town ; there he bought the clothes of an old peasant woman , and put them on.
Then he stained his face brown , and painted wrinkles on it as well , so that no one could have recognized him.
Then he filled a small cask with old Hungary wine in which was mixed a powerful sleeping-drink.
He put the cask in a basket , which he took on his back , and walked with slow and tottering steps to the count 's castle.
It was already dark when he arrived.
After all , thou hast no bed for the night , and must take one where thou canst find it"
The old woman tottered up to them , begged them to lift the basket from her back , and sat down beside them at the fire.
`` What hast thou got in thy little cask , old lady ?"
asked one.
`` A good mouthful of wine ,"
she answered.
`` I live by trade , for money and fair words I am quite ready to let you have a glass"
`` Let us have it here , then ,"
said the soldier , and when he had tasted one glass he said , `` When wine is good , I like another glass ,"
and had another poured out for himself , and the rest followed his example.
`` Hallo , comrades ,"
The old woman carried her cask into the stable.
She poured out as much as they wanted until the spring ran dry.
The soldiers outside had already been asleep for a long time , and were lying on the ground motionless , as if dead.
So he wrapped the horse 's hoofs in old rags , led him carefully out , leapt upon him , and galloped off.
When day broke , the master galloped to the castle on the stolen horse.
The count had just got up , and was looking out of the window.
`` Good morning , Sir Count ,"
Then he set a ladder up to the bedroom , put the dead body on his shoulders , and began to climb up.
`` Now ,"
thought the thief , `` the favourable moment has come ,"
stole nimbly out of his corner , and climbed up the ladder straight into the countess 's bedroom.
`` Dear wife ,"
I will not put him to open shame ; besides , I am sorry for the parents.
The countess gave him the sheet.
`` I tell you what ,"
She would not gainsay the count , and although she did it unwillingly she drew the ring from her finger , and gave it to him.
The thief made off with both these things , and reached home safely before the count in the garden had finished his work of burying.
What a long face the count did pull when the master came next morning , and brought him the sheet and the ring.
`` Art thou a wizard ?"
said he , `` Who has fetched thee out of the grave in which I myself laid thee , and brought thee to life again ?"
`` You did not bury me ,"
said the thief , `` but the poor sinner on the gallows ,"
and he told him exactly how everything had happened , and the count was forced to own to him that he was a clever , crafty thief.
`` But thou hast not reached the end yet ,"
he added , `` thou hast still to perform the third task , and if thou dost not succeed in that , all is of no use"
The master smiled and returned no answer.
In the sack he had some crabs , and in the bundle short wax-candles.
He sat down in the churchyard , took out a crab , and stuck a wax-candle on his back.
Then he lighted the little light , put the crab on the ground , and let it creep about.
Hereupon he put on a long black garment that looked like a monk 's cowl , and stuck a gray beard on his chin.
I am Peter , who opens and shuts the gate of heaven.
Behold how the dead outside there in the churchyard , are wandering about collecting their bones.
Come , come , and creep into the sack ; the world is about to be destroyed !"
The cry echoed through the whole village.
`` To tell the truth ,"
answered the parson , `` that is what I myself have been thinking , so if you are inclined , we will set out on our way"
`` Yes ,"
answered the clerk , `` but you , the pastor , have the precedence , I will follow"
So the parson went first , and ascended the pulpit where the master opened his sack.
The parson crept in first , and then the clerk.
Then he bolted the door upon them , and went away.
`` Where hast thou left them ?"
asked the lord.
`` They are lying upstairs in a sack in the pigeon-house , and imagine that they are in heaven"
The count went up himself , and convinced himself that the master had told the truth.
When he had delivered the parson and clerk from their captivity , he said , `` Thou art an arch-thief , and hast won thy wager.
The arch-thief took leave of his parents , once more went forth into the wide world , and no one has ever heard of him since"
Long , long ago in Japan there lived an old man and his wife.
She was always grumbling about something from morning to night.
The old man had for a long time ceased to take any notice of her crossness.
He loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child.
The old man would open her cage and let her fly about the room , and they would play together.
Then when supper-time came , he always saved some tit - bits from his meal with which to feed his little bird.
Now one day the old man went out to chop wood in the forest , and the old woman stopped at home to wash clothes.
I thought it was some food put out for me in that basin , and I ate it all.
If I have made a mistake I beg you to forgive me ! tweet , tweet , tweet !"
But not so.
Now she was only too delighted to have some cause of complaint against the pet.
In the evening the old man came home.
But to - night the old man was very disappointed , for not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen.
He quickened his steps , hastily drew off his straw sandals , and stepped on to the veranda.
Still no sparrow was to be seen.
He now felt sure that his wife , in one of her cross tempers , had shut the sparrow up in its cage.
So he called her and said anxiously : `` Where is Suzume San -LRB- Miss person_0 -RRB- today ?"
The old woman pretended not to know at first , and answered : `` Your sparrow ? I am sure I do n't know.
Now I come to think of it , I have n't seen her all the afternoon.
I should n't wonder if the un - grateful bird had flown away and left you after all your petting !"
`` How could you be so cruel ? Oh ! how could you so cruel ?"
was all that the old man could answer.
He was too kind-hearted to punish his be shrew of a wife , but he was terribly distressed at what had happened to his poor little sparrow.
`` What a dreadful misfortune for my poor Suzume San to lose her tongue !"
he said to himself.
The old man shed many tears after his cross wife had gone to sleep.
Having decided this he was able to go to sleep at last.
He never stopped to rest for his noonday meal , and it was far on in the afternoon when he found himself near a large bamboo wood.
He could hardly believe his eyes for joy , and ran forward quickly to greet her.
Then the old man knew that his sparrow was a fairy , and no common bird.
It would be difficult to exaggerate the old man 's rejoicing now.
And above all she was a fairy.
The sparrow asked him to follow her , and flying before him she led him to a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove.
The old man was utterly astonished when he entered the house to find what a beautiful place it was.
Beautiful vases and lacquer boxes adorned the tokonoma -LRB- Footnote : An alcove where precious objects are displayed.
-RRB- of every room.
Then the Lady person_0 , as we will now call her , introduced all her family to the old man.
In the middle of the dinner some of the sparrow 's daughters performed a wonderful dance , called the `` suzume-odori"
or the `` person_0 's dance ,"
to amuse the guest.
Never had the old man enjoyed himself so much.
It was his anxiety to know how she fared and what had really happened to her that had led him to seek her.
Now he knew that all was well he could return home with a light heart.
If ever she wanted him for anything she had only to send for him and he would come at once.
But now that he knew where the Lady person_0 lived he would come to see her whenever he had the time.
Indeed , she only felt sorrow for the old man who had to put up with it all his life.
she asked in a big voice.
`` Why do you come back so late ?"
`` Now let us see what is in the box ,"
said the old man , not giving her time to grumble again.
`` You must help me open it"
And they both sat down before the box and opened it.
To their utter astonishment they found the box filled to the brim with gold and silver coins and many other precious things.
The old man was overjoyed at the sight of the riches that were now his.
He said : `` Thanks to my good little sparrow ! Thanks to my good little sparrow !"
many times.
`` You silly old man ,"
said she , `` Why did you not bring the large box ? Just think what we have lost.
We might have had twice as much silver and gold as this.
You are certainly an old fool !"
she screamed , and then went to bed as angry as she could be.
Early the next morning she got up and made the old man describe the way to the sparrow 's house.
When he saw what was in her mind he tried to keep her from going , but it was useless.
She would not listen to one word he said.
But her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else.
`` How could she ,"
they asked each other , `` inflict such a heavy punishment for such a trifling offense as that of eating some rice-paste by mistake ?"
They had not long to wait.
At last she saw the eaves of the house peeping out from amongst the bamboo foliage.
She hastened to the door and knocked loudly.
I have come myself to get the box which he so stupidly left behind.
I shall soon take my leave if you will give me the big box -- that is all I want !"
The Lady person_0 at once consented , and told her servants to bring out the big box.
The old woman eagerly seized it and hoisted it on her back , and without even stopping to thank the Lady person_0 began to hurry homewards.
While she was staggering along under the heavy load , her desire to open the box became too great to be resisted.
What she saw , however , so terrified her that she nearly lost her senses.
Not even in nightmares had she ever seen such horrible creatures as her much - coveted box contained.
I only hope this may be a lesson to you in the future !"
The mayor stood at the open window.
`` Hark ` ee , youngster !"
he cried.
`` You 're a good boy ,"
said Mr.
Mayor.
`` You 're a civil boy.
How much have you got in it ?"
`` Half a quartern ,"
stammered the boy , in a frightened voice.
`` And this morning she had just as much ,"
the mayor continued.
`` No ,"
replied the boy , `` it was yesterday"
`` Two halves make a whole.
Poor child -- there , go !"
Accordingly the boy went on his way.
He kept his cap in his hand , and the wind played with his yellow hair , so that great locks of it stood up straight.
The washerwoman was obliged to lean against the bench , to support it.
`` I was very nearly sailing away ,"
she said.
`` It is a good thing that you are come , for I have need to recruit my strength a little.
For six hours I 've been standing in the water.
Have you brought anything for me ?"
The boy produced the bottle , and the mother put it to her mouth , and took a little.
`` Ah , how that revives one !"
she said : `` how it warms ! It is as good as a hot meal , and not so dear.
And you , my boy ! you look quite pale.
You are shivering in your thin clothes -- to be sure it is autumn.
Ugh ! how cold the water is ! I hope I shall not be ill.
.
And she stepped up to the bridge on which the boy stood , and came ashore.
The water dripped from the straw matting she had wound round her , and from her gown.
`` I work and toil as much as ever I can ,"
she said , `` but I do it willingly , if I can only manage to bring you up honestly and well , my boy"
As she spoke , a somewhat older woman came towards them.
The curl was intended to cover the eye , but it only made the defect more striking.
This was a friend of the laundress.
She was called among the neighbors , `` Lame person_1 with the curl"
`` Oh , you poor thing ! How you work , standing there in the water !"
cried the visitor.
`` You really require something to warm you ; and yet malicious folks cry out about the few drops you take !"
`` A good many will take more than they need -- but that 's not called drinking.
_ They _ are good ; but _ you _ are good for nothing !"
cried person_1 , indignantly.
`` Ah , so he spoke to you , my child ?"
said the washerwoman ; and her lips trembled as she spoke.
Still , I have had much misfortune from that house"
`` You were in service there when the mayor 's parents were alive , and lived in that house.
That is many years ago : many bushels of salt have been eaten since then , and we may well be thirsty ;"
and person_1 smiled.
`` The mayor has a great dinner party to-day.
The guests were to have been put off , but it was too late , and the dinner was already cooked.
The footman told me about it.
A letter came a little while ago , to say that the younger brother had died in Copenhagen"
`` Died !"
repeated the laundress -- and she became pale as death.
`` Yes , certainly ,"
said person_1.
`` Do you take that so much to heart ? Well , you must have known him years ago , when you were in service in the house"
`` Is he dead ? He was such a good , worthy man ! There are not many like him"
And the tears rolled down her cheeks.
`` Good heavens ! everything is whirling around me -- it was too much for me.
I feel quite ill"
And she leaned against the plank.
`` Good heavens , you are ill indeed !"
exclaimed the other woman.
`` Come , come , it will pass over presently.
But no , you really look seriously ill.
.
The best thing will be for me to lead you home"
`` But my linen yonder --"
`` I will take care of that.
Come , give me your arm.
The boy can stay here and take care of it , and I 'll come back and finish the washing ; that 's only a trifle"
The laundress 's limbs shook under her.
`` I have stood too long in the cold water ,"
she said faintly , `` and I have eaten and drunk nothing since this morning.
The fever is in my bones.
O kind person_0 , help me to get home ! My poor child !"
and she burst into tears.
The boy wept too , and soon he was sitting alone by the river , beside the damp linen.
The two women could make only slow progress.
Many people assembled round her , and Lame person_1 ran into the house to get help.
The mayor and his guests came to the window.
`` That 's the washerwoman !"
he said.
`` She has taken a glass too much.
She is good for nothing.
It 's a pity for the pretty son she has.
I really like the child very well ; but the mother is good for nothing"
Presently the laundress came to herself , and they led her into her poor dwelling , and put her to bed.
Strictly speaking , she drew it ashore , wet as it was , and laid it in a basket.
Towards evening she was sitting in the poor little room with the laundress.
Soon the patient felt a little better.
The warm beer had strengthened her , and the fragrance of the provisions pleased her also.
`` Thanks , you kind soul ,"
she said to person_1.
`` I will tell you all when the boy is asleep.
I think he has dropped off already.
How gentle and good he looks , as he lies there with his eyes closed.
He does not know what his mother has suffered , and person_0 grant he may never know it.
I was in service at the councillor 's , the father of the mayor.
It happened that the youngest of the sons , the student , came home.
I was young then , a wild girl , but honest , that I may declare in the face of person_0.
The student was merry and kind , good and brave.
Every drop of blood in him was good and honest.
I have not seen a better man on this earth.
He was the son of the house , and I was only a maid , but we formed an attachment to each other , honestly and honourably.
And he told his mother of it , for she was in his eyes as a Deity on earth ; and she was wise and gentle.
With a firm yet gentle seriousness she spoke to me , and it seemed as if Wisdom itself were speaking.
She showed me clearly , in spirit and in truth , the difference there was between him and me"
` Now he is charmed with your pretty appearance , ' she said , ` but your good looks will leave you.
You have not been educated as he has.
You are not equals in mind , and there is the misfortune.
I know that a worthy man wishes to marry you -- an artisan -- I mean Erich the glovemaker.
He is a widower without children , and is well to do.
Think it over.
I kissed her hand , and wept bitter tears , and I wept still more when I went into my room and threw myself on my bed.
It was a heavy night that I had to pass through.
person_0 knows what I suffered and how I wrestled ! The next Sunday I went to the Lord 's house , to pray for strength and guidance.
It seemed like a Providence , that as I stepped out of church Erich came towards me.
And now there was no longer a doubt in my mind.
We were suited to each other in rank and in means , and he was even then a thriving man.
` Yes , it will come ! ' he answered ; and upon this we joined hands.
I went home to my mistress.
I wore the gold ring that the son had given me at my heart.
I could not put it on my finger in the daytime , but only in the evening when I went to bed.
Then my mistress put her arms round me and kissed me.
`` Oh , you were a dear , good mistress ,"
cried person_1.
`` Never shall I forget how kind you and your husband were !"
`` Yes , those were our good years , when you were with us.
We had not any children yet.
The student I never saw again.
-- Yes , though , I saw him , but he did not see me.
He was here at his mother 's funeral.
I saw him stand by the grave.
I know that he never married ; I believe he became a lawyer.
He had forgotten me ; and even if he had seen me again , he would not have known me , I look so ugly.
And that is very fortunate"
And then she spoke of her days of trial , and told how misfortune had come as it were swooping down upon them.
`` We had five hundred dollars ,"
`` Just at that time my dear sweet boy who is sleeping yonder was born.
My husband was struck down by a long heavy illness : for three quarters of a year I was compelled to dress and undress him.
We went back more and more , and fell into debt.
All that we had was sold , and my husband died.
But He will take me to Himself in His own good time , and will not forsake my boy"
And she fell asleep.
Towards morning she felt much refreshed , and strong enough , as she thought , to go back to her work.
It was too late ! A barber-surgeon was brought to open a vein in her arm ; but the poor woman was dead.
`` She has drunk herself to death !"
said the mayor.
The money was to be paid , according to the mayor 's discretion , in larger or smaller sums , to her or to her child.
`` There was some fuss between my brother and her ,"
said the mayor.
He may turn out a reputable working man"
And person_0 gave its blessing to these words.
`` My dear mother !"
he cried , as the tears fell fast.
`` Is it true what they said : that she was good for nothing ?"
`` No , she was good for much !"
replied the old servant , and she looked up indignantly.
`` I knew it many a year ago , and more than all since last night.
'"
By the high-road in the forest lay a lonely peasant 's hut ; the road went right through the farmyard.
The sun shone down , and all the windows were open.
In the house was bustle and movement ; but in the garden , in an arbor of blossoming elder , stood an open coffin.
A dead man had been carried out here , and he was to be buried this morning.
It was a complete herbanum , gathered by him in various places ; it was to be buried with him , for so he had wished it.
With each flower a chapter in his life was associated.
-LRB- Illustration : THE POWER OF THE BOOK.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Who is the dead man ?"
we asked ; and the answer was : `` The Old Student.
They say he was once a brisk lad , and studied the old languages , and sang , and even wrote poems.
She gave it to him , the young lady in the nobleman 's garden.
Here is the water rose , which he plucked himself , and moistened with salt tears -- the roses of the sweet waters.
Here 's an evergreen from the flower-pot of the tavern ; and here 's a naked sharp blade of grass.
The blooming elder waves its fresh fragrant blossoms over the dead man 's head , and the swallow flies past again.
`` Pee-wit ! pee-wit !"
One day Sun , Moon , and person_0 went out to dine with their uncle and aunts Thunder and Lightning.
Their mother -LRB- one of the most distant Stars you see far up in the sky -RRB- waited alone for her children 's return.
Now both Sun and person_0 were greedy and selfish.
Then Sun -LRB- who was eldest -RRB- said , `` I have brought nothing home for you.
I went out to enjoy myself with my friends -- not to fetch a dinner for my mother !"
And person_0 said , `` Neither have I brought anything home for you , mother.
You could hardly expect me to bring a collection of good things for you , when I merely went out for my own pleasure"
But Moon said , `` Mother , fetch a plate , see what I have brought you"
And shaking her hands she showered down such a choice dinner as never was seen before.
Henceforth , your rays shall ever be hot and scorching , and shall burn all that they touch.
And men shall hate you , and cover their heads when you appear"
-LRB- And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.
-RRB- Then she turned to person_0 and said , `` You also who forgot your mother in the midst of your selfish pleasures -- hear your doom.
You shall always blow in the hot dry weather , and shall parch and shrivel all living things.
And men shall detest and avoid you from this very time"
-LRB- And that is why the person_0 in the hot weather is still so disagreeable.
No noxious glare shall accompany your pure rays , and men shall always call you ` blessed"
' -LRB- And that is why the moon 's light is so soft , and cool , and beautiful even to this day.
-RRB-"
`` I love the children ,"
said the Moon , `` especially the quite little ones -- they are so droll.
Sometimes I peep into the room , between the curtain and the window frame , when they are not thinking of me.
It gives me pleasure to see them dressing and undressing.
`` But about what I was going to tell you.
This evening I looked through a window , before which no curtain was drawn , for nobody lives opposite.
I saw a whole troop of little ones , all of one family , and among them was a little sister.
She is only four years old , but can say her prayers as well as any of the rest.
`` This evening the two elder children were a little boisterous.
She was praying the Lord 's prayer aloud.
But her mother interrupted her in the middle of her prayer.
' The little one lay silent , and looked at her mother in embarrassment.
'"
`` This evening I saw a German play acted ,"
said the Moon.
`` It was in a little town.
The male and female servants stood outside , peeping through the chinks , although a real policeman was inside , threatening them with a stick.
The chandelier gave little leaps , the crowd got their knuckles rapped , and I , the Moon , was present at the performance from beginning to end"
ONCE upon a time there was an old cat , called Mrs.
person_1 Twitchit , who was an anxious parent.
She caught Moppet and Mittens , but she could not find person_0.
Mrs.
person_1 went up and down all over the house , mewing for person_0.
She looked in the pantry under the staircase , and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets.
She went right upstairs and looked into the attics , but she could not find him anywhere.
It was an old , old house , full of cupboards and passages.
Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot , and things disappeared at night -- especially cheese and bacon.
Mrs.
person_1 became more and more distracted , and mewed dreadfully.
While their mother was searching the house , Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.
The cupboard door was not locked , so they pushed it open and came out.
They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.
They patted it with their little soft paws -- `` Shall we make dear little muffins ?"
said Mittens to Moppet.
But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door , and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.
Mittens ran away to the dairy , and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.
The visitor was a neighbor , Mrs.
Ribby ; she had called to borrow some yeast.
Mrs.
said person_1 , shedding tears.
`` I 've lost my dear son Thomas ; I 'm afraid the rats have got him"
She wiped her eyes with an apron.
`` He 's a bad kitten , Cousin person_1 ; he made a cat 's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea.
Where have you looked for him ?"
`` All over the house ! The rats are too many for me.
What a thing it is to have an unruly family !"
said Mrs.
person_1 Twitchit.
`` The chimney wants sweeping -- Oh , dear me , Cousin Ribby -- now Moppet and Mittens are gone !"
`` They have both got out of the cup - board !"
Ribby and person_1 set to work to search the house thoroughly again.
They poked under the beds with Ribby 's umbrella , and they rummaged in cupboards.
They even fetched a candle , and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics.
They could not find anything , but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.
`` Yes , it is infested with rats ,"
said person_1 tearfully , `` I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen , and we had them for dinner last Saturday.
And once I saw the old father rat -- an enormous old rat , Cousin Ribby.
I was just going to jump upon him , when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole"
`` The rats get upon my nerves , Cousin Ribby ,"
said person_1.
Ribby and person_1 searched and searched.
They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor.
But there was nothing to be seen.
They returned to the kitchen.
`` Here 's one of your kittens at least ,"
said Ribby , dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.
They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor.
She seemed to be in a terrible fright.
`` Oh ! Mother , Mother ,"
said Moppet , `` there 's been an old woman rat in the kitchen , and she 's stolen some of the dough !"
The two cats ran to look at the dough pan.
Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers , and a lump of dough was gone ! `` Which way did she go , Moppet ?"
But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.
Ribby and person_1 took her with them to keep her safely in sight , while they went on with their search.
They went into the dairy.
The first thing they found was Mittens , hiding in an empty jar.
They tipped up the jar , and she scrambled out.
`` Oh , Mother , Mother !"
Ribby and person_1 looked at one another.
`` A rolling-pin and butter ! Oh , my poor son Thomas !"
exclaimed person_1 , wringing her paws.
`` A rolling-pin ?"
said Ribby.
`` Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest ?"
Ribby and person_1 rushed upstairs again.
Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.
`` This is serious , Cousin person_1 ,"
said Ribby.
`` We must send for John Joiner at once , with a saw"
person_0 did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.
When he saw that his mother was going to bake , he determined to hide.
He looked about for a nice convenient place , and he fixed upon the chimney.
The fire had only just been lighted , and it was not hot ; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks.
person_0 got upon the fender and looked up.
It was a big old-fashioned fireplace.
The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about.
So there was plenty of room for a little person_0 Cat.
He jumped right up into the fireplace , balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs.
person_0 coughed and choked with the smoke ; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below.
He made up his mind to climb right to the top , and get out on the slates , and try to catch sparrows.
`` I can not go back.
If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket"
The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one.
It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.
person_0 was getting very frightened ! He climbed up , and up , and up.
Then he waded sideways through inches of soot.
He was like a little sweep himself.
It was most confusing in the dark.
One flue seemed to lead into another.
There was less smoke , but person_0 felt quite lost.
He scrambled up and up ; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall.
There were some mutton bones lying about -- `` This seems funny ,"
said person_0.
It makes me sneeze ,"
said person_0.
He squeezed through the hole in the wall , and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.
All at once he fell head over heels in the dark , down a hole , and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.
It was a very small stuffy fusty room , with boards , and rafters , and cobwebs , and lath and plaster.
Opposite to him -- as far away as he could sit -- was an enormous rat.
`` What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts ?"
said the rat , chattering his teeth.
`` Please sir , the chimney wants sweeping ,"
said poor person_0.
`` Anna person_3 ! Anna person_3 !"
squeaked the rat.
There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.
Anna person_3 did the tying.
The old rat watched her and took snuff.
When she had finished , they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.
`` Anna person_3 ,"
said the old man rat -LRB- whose name was Samuel Whiskers -RRB- , -- `` Anna person_3 , make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner"
`` It requires dough and a pat of butter , and a rolling-pin ,"
said Anna person_3 , considering person_0 with her head on one side.
`` No ,"
said Samuel Whiskers , `` make it properly , Anna person_3 , with breadcrumbs"
`` Nonsense ! Butter and dough ,"
replied Anna person_3.
The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.
Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot , and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter.
He did not meet anybody.
He made a second journey for the rolling - pin.
He pushed it in front of him with his paws , like a brewer 's man trundling a barrel.
He could hear Ribby and person_1 talking , but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.
They did not see him.
Anna person_3 went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.
She borrowed a small saucer , and scooped up the dough with her paws.
She did not observe Moppet.
While person_0 was left alone under the floor of the attic , he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.
Except a spider , which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically , from a safe distance.
It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles.
It did not offer to assist him.
person_0 wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.
Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling.
First they smeared him with butter , and then they rolled him in the dough.
`` Will not the string be very indigestible , Anna person_3 ?"
inquired Samuel Whiskers.
She laid hold of his ears.
person_0 bit and spat , and mewed and wriggled ; and the rolling-pin went roly - poly , roly ; roly , poly , roly.
The rats each held an end.
`` His tail is sticking out ! You did not fetch enough dough , Anna person_3"
`` I fetched as much as I could carry ,"
replied Anna person_3.
`` I do not think"
-- said Samuel Whiskers , pausing to take a look at person_0 -- `` I do NOT think it will be a good pudding.
It smells sooty"
`` We are discovered and interrupted , Anna person_3 ; let us collect our property , -- and other people 's , -- and depart at once"
`` I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding"
`` But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible , whatever you may urge to the contrary"
`` Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane ,"
said Anna person_3.
`` I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney"
Then he nailed the plank down again , and put his tools in his bag , and came downstairs.
The cat family had quite recovered.
They invited him to stay to dinner.
The dumpling had been peeled off person_0 , and made separately into a bag pudding , with currants in it to hide the smuts.
They had been obliged to put person_0 into a hot bath to get the butter off.
And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon -- I looked up the lane from the corner , and I saw Mr.
Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run , with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow , which looked very like mine.
They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.
Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath.
Anna person_3 was still arguing in shrill tones.
She seemed to know her way , and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.
After that , there were no more rats for a long time at person_1 Twitchit 's.
As for Farmer Potatoes , he has been driven nearly distracted.
And they are all descended from Mr.

The End"
Long , long ago , there lived an old farmer and his wife who had made their home in the mountains , far from any town.
Their only neighbor was a bad and malicious badger.
Then he laid traps for the wicked animal.
The farmer was delighted at having caught his enemy , and carried him home securely bound with rope.
When he reached the house the farmer said to his wife : `` I have at last caught the bad badger.
You must keep an eye on him while I am out at work and not let him escape , because I want to make him into soup to-night"
Saying this , he hung the badger up to the rafters of his storehouse and went out to his work in the fields.
It was hard to think clearly in his uncomfortable position , for he had been hung upside down.
She looked tired and old.
`` Dear lady ,"
said the wily badger , `` you must be very weary doing such heavy work in your old age.
Wo n't you let me do that for you ? My arms are very strong , and I could relieve you for a little while !"
`` Thank you for your kindness ,"
You might untie me , for I promise not to try to escape.
If you are afraid of your husband , I will let you bind me again before his return when I have finished pounding the barley.
I am so tired and sore tied up like this.
If you would only let me down for a few minutes I would indeed be thankful !"
The old woman had a good and simple nature , and could not think badly of any one.
Much less did she think that the badger was only deceiving her in order to get away.
She felt sorry , too , for the animal as she turned to look at him.
The old woman then gave him the wooden pestle and told him to do the work for a short time while she rested.
He then killed her and cut her up and made soup of her , and waited for the return of the old farmer.
Towards sunset he left his work and turned to go home.
He was very tired , but the thought of the nice supper of hot badger soup awaiting his return cheered him.
The thought that the badger might get free and take revenge on the poor old woman never once came into his mind.
I have made the badger soup and have been waiting for you for a long time"
The old farmer quickly took off his straw sandals and sat down before his tiny dinner-tray.
Laughing loudly and derisively he escaped out of the house and ran away to his den in the hills.
The old man was left behind alone.
He could hardly believe what he had seen and heard.
Then when he understood the whole truth he was so scared and horrified that he fainted right away.
After a while he came round and burst into tears.
He cried loudly and bitterly.
He rocked himself to and fro in his hopeless grief.
And oh ! the horrible thought ; he had very nearly drunk the soup which the creature had made of his poor old woman.
`` Oh dear , oh dear , oh dear !"
he wailed aloud.
Now , not far away there lived in the same mountain a kind , good-natured old rabbit.
The old man told him all that had happened.
The farmer was at last comforted , and , wiping away his tears , thanked the rabbit for his goodness in coming to him in his distress.
The rabbit , seeing that the farmer was growing calmer , went back to his home to lay his plans for the punishment of the badger.
The next day the weather was fine , and the rabbit went out to find the badger.
The rabbit led the way miles away from their homes , out on the hills where the grass grew tall and thick and sweet.
They both set to work to cut down as much as they could carry home , to store it up for their winter 's food.
This time the rabbit made the badger go first.
The badger heard the flint striking , and asked : `` What is that noise.
` Crack , crack ' ?"
`` Oh , that is nothing"
replied the rabbit ; `` I only said ` Crack , crack ' because this mountain is called Crackling Mountain"
The fire soon spread in the bundle of dry grass on the badger 's back.
The badger , hearing the crackle of the burning grass , asked , `` What is that ?"
`` Now we have come to the ` Burning Mountain , '"
answered the rabbit.
By this time the bundle was nearly burned out and all the hair had been burned off the badger 's back.
He now knew what had happened by the smell of the smoke of the burning grass.
Screaming with pain the badger ran as fast as he could to his hole.
The rabbit followed and found him lying on his bed groaning with pain.
`` What an unlucky fellow you are !"
said the rabbit.
`` I ca n't imagine how this happened ! I will bring you some medicine which will heal your back quickly !"
The rabbit went away glad and smiling to think that the punishment upon the badger had already begun.
He went home and made an ointment by mixing some sauce and red pepper together.
The badger thanked him and begged him to apply it at once.
But no language can describe the agony of the badger as soon as the red pepper had been pasted all over his sore back.
He rolled over and over and howled loudly.
The rabbit , looking on , felt that the farmer 's wife was beginning to be avenged.
When the rabbit saw that the badger was getting well , he thought of another plan by which he could compass the creature 's death.
So he went one day to pay the badger a visit and to congratulate him on his recovery.
During the conversation the rabbit mentioned that he was going fishing , and described how pleasant fishing was when the weather was fine and the sea smooth.
This was just what the rabbit wanted , so he agreed.
Then he went home and built two boats , one of wood and the other of clay.
The day came when the rabbit had arranged to take the badger fishing.
He kept the wooden boat himself and gave the badger the clay boat.
They both got into their boats and set out.
After going some distance from the shore the rabbit proposed that they should try their boats and see which one could go the quickest.
The badger fell in with the proposal , and they both set to work to row as fast as they could for some time.
In the middle of the race the badger found his boat going to pieces , for the water now began to soften the clay.
He cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him.
Then he raised his oar and struck at the badger with all his strength till he fell with the sinking clay boat and was seen no more.
Thus at last he kept his promise to the old farmer.
The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes.
THE shinansha , OR THE SOUTH POINTING CARRIAGE.
Now long ago in China , there was a still more wonderful invention called the shinansha.
This was a kind of chariot with the figure of a man on it always pointing to the South.
No matter how the chariot was placed the figure always wheeled about and pointed to the South.
This curious instrument was invented by person_0 , one of the three Chinese person_2s of the Mythological age.
person_0 was the son of the person_2 Yuhi.
Before he was born his mother had a vision which foretold that her son would be a great man.
As she looked at the North Star , strange to relate , it shot forth vivid flashes of lightning in every direction.
Soon after this her son person_0 came into the world.
person_0 in time grew to manhood and succeeded his father the person_2 Yuhi.
His early reign was greatly troubled by the rebel Shiyu.
This rebel wanted to make himself King , and many were the battles which he fought to this end.
Shiyu was a wicked magician , his head was made of iron , and there was no man that could conquer him.
At last person_0 declared war against the rebel and led his army to battle , and the two armies met on a plain called Takuroku.
No matter however strong and brave the person_2 's soldiers were , the rebel with his magic could always escape in the end.
After a long time he invented the shinansha with the figure of a man always pointing South , for there were no compasses in those days.
With this instrument to show him the way he need not fear the dense fogs raised up by the magician to confound his men.
person_0 again declared war against Shiyu.
He placed the shinansha in front of his army and led the way to the battlefield.
The battle began in earnest.
But this time no soldier minded the fog , not one was confused.
person_0 by pointing to the shinansha could find his way and directed the army without a single mistake.
He closely pursued the rebel army and drove them backward till they came to a big river.
This river person_0 and his men found was swollen by the floods and impossible to cross.
Shiyu by using his magic art quickly passed over with his army and shut himself up in a fortress on the opposite bank.
When person_0 found his march checked he was wild with disappointment , for he had very nearly overtaken the rebel when the river stopped him.
One day he stepped forth from his tent and after walking about for a short time he came to a pond.
Here he sat down on the bank and was lost in thought.
It was autumn.
The trees growing along the edge of the water were shedding their leaves , which floated hither and thither on the surface of the pond.
By and by , person_0 's attention was attracted to a spider on the brink of the water.
The little insect was trying to get on to one of the floating leaves near by.
It did so at last , and was soon floating over the water to the other side of the pond.
He set to work and persevered till he invented the first boat.
person_0 now took his army across the river , and attacked Shiyu 's headquarters.
He gained a complete victory , and so put an end to the war which had troubled his country for so long.
This wise and good person_2 did not rest till he had secured peace and prosperity throughout his whole land.
He was beloved by his subjects , who now enjoyed their happiness of peace for many long years under him.
As it came nearer person_0 saw that it was a great person_1.
The person_1 approached and bowed down its head before the person_2.
The Empress and the courtiers were so frightened that they ran away screaming.
But the person_2 only smiled and called to them to stop , and said : `` Do not be afraid.
This is a messenger from Heaven.
My time here is finished !"
He then mounted the person_1 , which began to ascend towards the sky.
When the Empress and the courtiers saw this they all cried out together : `` Wait a moment ! We wish to come too"
And they all ran and caught hold of the person_1 's beard and tried to mount him.
But it was impossible for so many people to ride on the person_1.
Meanwhile the Empress and a few of the courtiers were safely seated on the person_1 's back.
After some time a bow and an arrow dropped to the earth in the courtyard of the Palace.
They were recognized as having belonged to the person_2.
The courtiers took them up carefully and preserved them as sacred relics in the Palace"
He who tried this , however , and was discovered by her , was to have his head struck off , and stuck on a post.
Ninety-seven posts with the heads of dead men were already standing before the castle , and no one had come forward for a long time.
The princess was delighted , and thought to herself , `` Now I shall be free as long as I live"
Then three brothers appeared before her , and announced to her that they were desirous of trying their luck.
The second crept into the cellar of the palace , but she perceived him also from the first window , and his fate was sealed.
His head was placed on the nine and ninetieth post.
As he was so handsome , and begged so earnestly , she said , `` Yes , I will grant thee that , but thou wilt not succeed"
Next day he meditated for a long time how he should hide himself , but all in vain.
Then he seized his gun and went out hunting.
When he had aimed at it , the fish cried , `` Do n't shoot , and I will make it worth thy while"
He allowed it to dive down again , went onwards , and met a fox which was lame.
He fired and missed it , and the fox cried , `` You had much better come here and draw the thorn out of my foot for me"
The youth let him go , and then as it was evening , returned home.
Next day he was to hide himself ; but howsoever much he puzzled his brains over it , he did not know where.
The raven hung his head and thought it over for a longtime.
At length he croaked , `` I have it"
She ordered the raven to be shot , and the egg to be brought and broken , and the youth was forced to come out.
She said , `` For once thou art excused , but if thou dost not do better than this , thou art lost !"
The fish thought for a while , and at last cried , `` I have it ! I will shut thee up in my stomach"
He swallowed him , and went down to the bottom of the lake.
She ordered the fish to be caught and killed , and then the youth appeared.
Every one can imagine what a state of mind he was in.
She said , `` Twice thou art forgiven , but be sure that thy head will be set on the hundredth post"
On the last day , he went with a heavy heart into the country , and met the fox.
`` Thou knowest how to find all kinds of hiding-places ,"
said he ; `` I let thee live , now advise me where I shall hide myself so that the King 's daughter shall not discover me"
`` That 's a hard task ,"
answered the fox , looking very thoughtful.
At length he cried , `` I have it !"
and went with him to a spring , dipped himself in it , and came out as a stall-keeper in the market , and dealer in animals.
The youth had to dip himself in the water also , and was changed into a small sea-hare.
The merchant went into the town , and showed the pretty little animal , and many persons gathered together to see it.
And now the time arrived when she was to search for him.
She went to one window after another in turn , from the first to the eleventh , and did not see him.
She went back and felt the sea-hare beneath the braids of her hair.
Then she seized it , and threw it on the ground exclaiming , `` Away with thee , get out of my sight !"
It ran to the merchant , and both of them hurried to the spring , wherein they plunged , and received back their true forms.
The youth went straight to the palace.
The princess was already expecting him , and accommodated herself to her destiny.
The wedding was solemnized , and now he was king , and lord of all the kingdom.
There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants , and just one poor one , whom they called the little peasant.
The cow-herd said , `` All right , and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture , and set it among the grass"
The cow-herd answered , `` It is still standing out there eating.
It would not stop and come with us"
But the little peasant said , `` Oh , but I must have my beast back again"
Then they went back to the meadow together , but some one had stolen the calf , and it was gone.
The cow-herd said , `` It must have run away"
The peasant , however , said , `` Do n't tell me that ,"
and led the cow-herd before the mayor , who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.
The miller 's wife was alone in the house , and said to the peasant , `` Lay thyself on the straw there"
, and gave him a slice of bread with cheese on it.
The peasant ate it , and lay down with his skin beside him , and the woman thought , `` He is tired and has gone to sleep"
Then the woman served up four different things , roast meat , salad , cakes , and wine.
Just as they were about to sit down and eat , there was a knocking outside.
The woman said , `` Oh , heavens ! It is my husband !"
The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw , and asked , `` What is that fellow doing there ?"
`` Ah ,"
The man said , `` I have no objection , but be quick and get me something to eat"
The woman said , `` But I have nothing but bread and cheese"
`` I am contented with anything ,"
replied the husband , `` so far as I am concerned , bread and cheese will do ,"
and looked at the peasant and said , `` Come and eat some more with me"
The peasant did not require to be invited twice , but got up and ate.
After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was , lying on the ground , and asked , `` What hast thou there ?"
The peasant answered , `` I have a soothsayer inside it"
`` Can he foretell anything to me ?"
said the miller.
`` Why not ?"
answered the peasant , `` but he only says four things , and the fifth he keeps to himself"
The miller was curious , and said , `` Let him foretell something for once"
Then the peasant pinched the raven 's head , so that he croaked and made a noise like krr , krr.
The miller said , `` What did he say ?"
The peasant answered , `` In the first place , he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow"
`` Bless me !"
cried the miller , and went there and found the wine.
`` Now go on ,"
said he.
The peasant made the raven croak again , and said , `` In the second place , he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove"
`` Upon my word !"
cried the miller , and went thither , and found the roast meat.
The peasant made the raven prophesy still more , and said , `` Thirdly , he says that there is some salad on the bed"
`` That would be a fine thing !"
cried the miller , and went there and found the salad.
At last the peasant pinched the raven once more till he croaked , and said , `` Fourthly , he says that there are some cakes under the bed"
`` That would be a fine thing !"
cried the miller , and looked there , and found the cakes.
So they ate , and after that they bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophesy , until they agreed on three hundred thalers.
Then the peasant once more pinched the raven 's head till he croaked loudly.
The miller asked , `` What did he say ?"
The peasant replied , `` He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the cupboard in the entrance"
The miller said , `` The Devil must go out ,"
and opened the house-door ; then the woman was forced to give up the keys , and the peasant unlocked the cupboard.
The parson ran out as fast as he could , and the miller said , `` It was true ; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes"
The peasant , however , made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred thalers.
Then the small peasant was brought before the Mayor , and bidden to say from whence his wealth came.
He answered , `` I sold my cow 's skin in the town , for three hundred thalers"
The Mayor , however , said , `` But my servant must go first"
The innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death , and was to be rolled into the water , in a barrel pierced full of holes.
He was led forth , and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul.
He said to him , `` I set you free from the cupboard , set me free from the barrel"
The shepherd hearing that , came up to him , and asked , `` What art thou about ? What is it that thou wilt not do ?"
The peasant said , `` They want to make me Mayor , if I will but put myself in the barrel , but I will not do it"
The shepherd said , `` If nothing more than that is needful in order to be Mayor , I would get into the barrel at once"
The peasant said , `` If thou wilt get in , thou wilt be Mayor"
The parson went to the crowd , and declared that the mass had been said.
Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water.
When the barrel began to roll , the shepherd cried , `` I am quite willing to be Mayor"
and they rolled the barrel down into the water.
Then the peasants were astonished , and said , `` Peasant , from whence comest thou ? Hast thou come out of the water ?"
`` Yes , truly ,"
Said the peasants , `` Are there any more there ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said he , `` more than I could do anything with"
The Mayor pressed forward and said , `` I will go down first , and look about me , and if things promise well I 'll call you"
Then the entire village was dead , and the small peasant , as sole heir , became a rich man"
There was once upon a time a miller who lived with his wife in great contentment.
They had money and land , and their prosperity increased year by year more and more.
One morning he rose before daybreak and went out into the open air , thinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter.
As he was stepping over the mill - dam the first sunbeam was just breaking forth , and he heard a rippling sound in the pond.
He turned round and perceived a beautiful woman , rising slowly out of the water.
Her long hair , which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands , fell down on both sides , and covered her white body.
`` Be easy ,"
`` What else can that be ,"
thought the miller , `` but a young puppy or kitten ?"
and he promised her what she desired.
The nix descended into the water again , and he hurried back to his mill , consoled and in good spirits.
The miller stood as if struck by lightning ; he saw very well that the cunning nix had been aware of it , and had cheated him.
Hanging his head , he went up to his wife 's bedside and when she said , `` Why dost thou not rejoice over the fine boy ?"
he told her what had befallen him , and what kind of a promise he had given to the nix.
`` Of what use to me are riches and prosperity ?"
he added , `` if I am to lose my child ; but what can I do ?"
Even the relations , who had come thither to wish them joy , did not know what to say.
In the meantime prosperity again returned to the miller 's house.
It was not long before his wealth was greater than it had ever been before.
But he could not rejoice over it untroubled , for the bargain which he had made with the nix tormented his soul.
Whenever he passed the mill-pond , he feared she might ascend and remind him of his debt.
He never let the boy himself go near the water.
`` Beware ,"
he said to him , `` if thou dost but touch the water , a hand will rise , seize thee , and draw thee down"
But as year after year went by and the nix did not show herself again , the miller began to feel at ease.
The boy grew up to be a youth and was apprenticed to a huntsman.
When he had learned everything , and had become an excellent huntsman , the lord of the village took him into his service.
When it was evening , and the huntsman did not return home , his wife became alarmed.
She hastened to the water , and when she found his hunting-pouch lying on the shore , she could no longer have any doubt of the misfortune.
Lamenting her sorrow , and wringing her hands , she called on her beloved by name , but in vain.
The surface of the water remained calm , only the crescent moon stared steadily back at her.
The poor woman did not leave the pond.
At last her strength came to an end , she sank down to the ground and fell into a heavy sleep.
Presently a dream took possession of her.
She went up to it and opened the door ; there sat an old woman with white hair , who beckoned to her kindly.
At that very moment , the poor woman awoke , day had already dawned , and she at once resolved to act in accordance with her dream.
She laboriously climbed the mountain ; everything was exactly as she had seen it in the night.
The old woman received her kindly , and pointed out a chair on which she might sit.
`` Thou must have met with a misfortune ,"
she said , `` since thou hast sought out my lonely cottage"
With tears , the woman related what had befallen her.
`` Be comforted ,"
said the old woman , `` I will help thee.
Here is a golden comb for thee.
When thou hast done , lay it down on the bank , and thou wilt see what will happen"
The woman returned home , but the time till the full moon came , passed slowly.
He did not speak , but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances.
At the same instant , a second wave came rushing up , and covered the man 's head.
All had vanished , the mill-pond lay peaceful as before , and nothing but the face of the full moon shone on it.
Full of sorrow , the woman went back , but again the dream showed her the cottage of the old woman.
Next morning she again set out and complained of her woes to the wise woman.
The wife did as the old woman told her.
Immediately afterwards the water parted , and not only the head of the man , but half of his body also arose.
He stretched out his arms longingly towards her , but a second wave came up , covered him , and drew him down again.
`` Alas , what does it profit me ?"
said the unhappy woman , `` that I should see my beloved , only to lose him again !"
Despair filled her heart anew , but the dream led her a third time to the house of the old woman.
Immediately the head and the whole body of the man rose into the air , in a water-spout.
He quickly sprang to the shore , caught his wife by the hand and fled.
But they had scarcely gone a very little distance , when the whole pond rose with a frightful roar , and streamed out over the open country.
The flood which had overtaken them could not destroy them , but it tore them apart and carried them far away.
High mountains and deep valleys lay between them.
In order to keep themselves alive , they were both obliged to tend sheep.
For many long years they drove their flocks through field and forest and were full of sorrow and longing.
They met in a valley , but did not recognize each other ; yet they rejoiced that they were no longer so lonely.
Henceforth they each day drove their flocks to the same place ; they did not speak much , but they felt comforted.
When he had finished he saw that the shepherdess was weeping bitterly.
`` Why art thou weeping ?"
he asked.
`` Alas ,"
They embraced and kissed each other , and no one need ask if they were happy"
In a country there was a person_0 who had an only son who every day went out to hunt.
When he got there , he found himself in a jungle , and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots , who lived in it.
The young person_0 shot at some of them , and at once they all flew away up to the sky.
All , that is , but one , and this was their person_0 , who was called Hiraman parrot.
If you desert me like this , I will tell the Princess Labam"
Then the parrots all flew back to their person_0 , chattering.
The prince was greatly surprised , and said , `` Why , these birds can talk !"
Then he said to the parrots , `` Who is the Princess Labam ? Where does she live ?"
But the parrots would not tell him where she lived.
`` You can never get to the Princess Labam 's country"
That is all they would say.
The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more ; and he threw his gun away , and went home.
When he got home , he would not speak or eat , but lay on his bed for four or five days , and seemed very ill.
.
At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam.
`` I must go ,"
he said ; `` I must see what she is like.
Tell me where her country is"
`` We do not know where it is ,"
answered his father and mother.
`` Then I must go and look for it ,"
said the prince.
`` No , no ,"
they said , `` you must not leave us.
You are our only son.
Stay with us.
You will never find the Princess Labam"
`` I must try and find her ,"
said the prince.
`` Perhaps God will show me the way.
Still I must go"
So they had to let him go , though they cried very much at parting with him.
His father gave him fine clothes to wear , and a fine horse.
And he took his gun , and his bow and arrows , and a great many other weapons , `` for ,"
he said , `` I may want them"
His father , too , gave him plenty of rupees.
`` My child ,"
she said to him , `` When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats"
He then set out on his journey , and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees.
He bathed himself and his horse in the tank , and then sat down under a tree.
`` Now ,"
He opened his handkerchief , and took out a sweetmeat.
He found an ant in it.
He took out another.
There was an ant in that one too.
`` Never mind ,"
he said , `` I wo n't eat the sweetmeats ; the ants shall eat them"
Then the Ant-person_0 came and stood before him and said , `` You have been good to us.
If ever you are in trouble , think of me and we will come to you"
The person_0 's son thanked him , mounted his horse and continued his journey.
`` Why do you roar like that ?"
said the young person_0.
`` What is the matter with you ?"
`` I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years ,"
answered the tiger , `` and it hurts me so ; that is why I roar"
`` Well ,"
said the person_0 's son , `` I will take it out for you.
But perhaps , as you are a tiger , when I have made you well , you will eat me ?"
`` Oh , no ,"
said the tiger , `` I wo n't eat you.
Do make me well"
The tiger saw her coming , and hid the prince in the jungle , so that she should not see him.
`` What man hurt you that you roared so loud ?"
said the wife.
`` No one hurt me ,"
answered the husband ; `` but a person_0 's son came and took the thorn out of my foot"
`` Where is he ? Show him to me ,"
said his wife.
`` If you promise not to kill him , I will call him ,"
said the tiger.
`` I wo n't kill him ; only let me see him ,"
answered his wife.
Then the tiger called the person_0 's son , and when he came the tiger and his wife made him a great many salaams.
Then they gave him a good dinner , and he stayed with them for three days.
Every day he looked at the tiger 's foot , and the third day it was quite healed.
The person_0 's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle.
and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up.
The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things.
One said , `` I want this ;"
another said , `` You can not have it , for I want it ;"
and so on.
The person_0 's son said to them , `` Do not quarrel for these things.
I will shoot four arrows in four different directions.
Whichever of you gets to my first arrow , shall have the first thing -- the bed.
Whosoever gets to the second arrow , shall have the second thing -- the bag.
He who gets to the third arrow , shall have the third thing -- the bowl.
And he who gets to the fourth arrow , shall have the last things -- the stick and rope"
To this they agreed , and the prince shot off his first arrow.
Away raced the fakirs to get it.
Then he said , `` Bed , I wish to go to the Princess Labam 's country"
The person_0 's son asked some men he saw , `` Whose country is this ?"
`` The Princess Labam 's country ,"
they answered.
Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman.
`` Who are you ?"
she said.
`` Where do you come from ?"
`` I come from a far country ,"
he said ; `` do let me stay with you to - night"
`` No ,"
You can not stay in my house"
`` You are my aunty ,"
said the prince ; `` let me remain with you for this one night.
You see it is evening , and if I go into the jungle , then the wild beasts will eat me"
`` Well ,"
Then she took him into her house , and the person_0 's son was very glad.
The old woman began preparing dinner , but he stopped her , `` Aunty ,"
he said , `` I will give you food"
He put his hand into his bag , saying , `` Bag , I want some dinner ,"
and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner , served up on two gold plates.
The old woman and the person_0 's son then dined together.
When they had finished eating , the old woman said , `` Now I will fetch some water"
`` Do n't go ,"
said the prince.
`` You shall have plenty of water directly"
So he took his bowl and said to it , `` Bowl , I want some water ,"
and then it filled with water.
When it was full , the prince cried out , `` Stop , bowl ,"
and the bowl stopped filling.
`` See , aunty ,"
he said , `` with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want"
By this time night had come.
`` Aunty ,"
said the person_0 's son , `` why do n't you light a lamp ?"
`` There is no need ,"
she said.
When it was quite black night the princess got up.
Then she shone like the moon , and her beauty made night day.
She came out of her room , and sat on the roof of her palace.
In the daytime she never came out of her house ; she only came out at night.
All the people in her father 's country then went about their work and finished it.
The person_0 's son watched the princess quietly , and was very happy.
He said to himself , `` How lovely she is !"
`` Bed ,"
he said to it , `` I want to go to the Princess Labam 's bed-room"
So the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep.
The young person_0 took his bag and said , `` I want a great deal of betel - leaf ,"
and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf.
This he laid near the princess 's bed , and then his little bed carried him back to the old woman 's house.
Next morning all the princess 's servants found the betel-leaf , and began to eat it.
`` Where did you get all that betel-leaf ?"
asked the princess.
`` We found it near your bed ,"
answered the servants.
Nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there.
In the morning the old woman came to the person_0 's son.
`` Now it is morning ,"
she said , `` and you must go ; for if the king finds out all I have done for you , he will seize me"
`` I am ill to-day , dear aunty ,"
said the prince ; `` do let me stay till to-morrow morning"
`` Good ,"
said the old woman.
So he stayed , and they took their dinner out of the bag , and the bowl gave them water.
Then the person_0 's son sat on his bed , and it carried him to the princess.
He took his bag and said , `` Bag , I want a most lovely shawl"
It gave him a splendid shawl , and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep.
Then he went back to the old woman 's house and slept till morning.
In the morning , when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted.
`` See , mother ,"
she said ; `` Khuda must have given me this shawl , it is so beautiful"
Her mother was very glad too.
`` Yes , my child ,"
she said ; `` Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl"
When it was morning the old woman said to the person_0 's son , `` Now you must really go"
`` Aunty ,"
he answered , `` I am not well enough yet.
Let me stay a few days longer.
I will remain hidden in your house , so that no one may see me"
So the old woman let him stay.
When it was black night , the princess put on her lovely clothes and jewels , and sat on her roof.
At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep.
Then the person_0 's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room.
There he said to his bag , `` Bag , I want a very , very beautiful ring"
The bag gave him a glorious ring.
Then he took the Princess Labam 's hand gently to put on the ring , and she started up very much frightened.
`` Who are you ?"
she said to the prince.
`` Where do you come from ? Why do you come to my room ?"
`` Do not be afraid , princess ,"
he said ; `` I am no thief.
I am a great person_0 's son.
`` Well ,"
Her mother told this to the king.
`` Good ,"
said the king ; `` but if this person_0 's son wishes to marry my daughter , he must first do whatever I bid him.
If he fails I will kill him.
I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed , and out of this he must crush the oil in one day.
If he can not do this he shall die"
In the morning the person_0 's son told the old woman that he intended to marry the princess.
`` Oh ,"
said the old woman , `` go away from this country , and do not think of marrying her.
A great many person_0s and person_0s ' sons have come here to marry her , and her father has had them all killed.
He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do whatever he bids him.
If he can , then he shall marry the princess ; if he can not , the king will have him killed.
You will be killed too , if you try.
Do go away"
But the prince would not listen to anything she said.
`` Whoever wishes to marry my daughter ,"
he said to the prince , `` must first do all I tell him.
If he can not , then I have him killed.
So if you can not crush all the oil out of this mustard seed , you will die"
The prince was very sorry when he heard this.
`` How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day ?"
he said to himself ; `` and if I do not , the king will kill me"
He took the mustard seed to the old woman 's house , and did not know what to do.
At last he remembered the Ant-person_0 , and the moment he did so , the Ant-person_0 and his ants came to him.
`` Why do you look so sad ?"
said the Ant-person_0.
`` Be happy ,"
The person_0 's son lay down and slept , and the ants crushed out the oil for him.
The prince was very glad when he saw the oil.
The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king.
But the king said , `` You can not yet marry my daughter.
If you wish to do so , you must first fight with my two demons and kill them"
So all the kings and kings ' sons who wanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these demons ; `` for ,"
said the king to himself , `` perhaps the demons may be killed , and then I shall be rid of them"
When he heard of the demons the person_0 's son was very sad.
`` What can I do ?"
he said to himself.
`` How can I fight with these two demons ?"
Then he thought of his tiger : and the tiger and his wife came to him and said , `` Why are you so sad ?"
The person_0 's son answered , `` The king has ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them.
How can I do this ?"
`` Do not be frightened ,"
said the tiger.
`` Be happy.
I and my wife will fight with them for you"
Then the person_0 's son took out of his bag two splendid coats.
They were all gold and silver , and covered with pearls and diamonds.
`` Yes ,"
said the king , who did not care in the least who killed his demons , provided they were killed.
`` Then call your demons ,"
said the person_0 's son , `` and these tigers will fight them"
The king did so , and the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons.
`` That is good ,"
said the king.
`` But you must do something else before I give you my daughter.
Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum.
You must go and beat it.
If you can not do this , I will kill you"
The person_0 's son thought of his little bed ; so he went to the old woman 's house and sat on his bed.
`` Little bed ,"
he said , `` up in the sky is the king 's kettle-drum.
I want to go to it"
The bed flew up with him , and the person_0 's son beat the drum , and the king heard him.
Still , when he came down , the king would not give him his daughter.
`` You have ,"
he said to the prince , `` done the three things I told you to do ; but you must do one thing more"
`` If I can , I will ,"
said the person_0 's son.
Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his court-house.
It was a very , very thick trunk.
He gave the prince a wax hatchet , and said , `` Tomorrow morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet"
The person_0 's son went back to the old woman 's house.
He was very sad , and thought that now the person_0 would certainly kill him.
`` I had his oil crushed out by the ants ,"
he said to himself.
`` I had his demons killed by the tigers.
My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum.
But now what can I do ? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet ?"
At night he went on his bed to see the princess.
`` To-morrow ,"
he said to her , `` your father will kill me"
`` Why ?"
asked the princess.
`` He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet.
How can I ever do that ?"
said the person_0 's son.
`` Do not be afraid ,"
said the princess ; `` do as I bid you , and you will cut it in two quite easily"
Then she pulled out a hair from her head , and gave it to the prince.
`` To-morrow ,"
' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet 's blade"
The king said , `` Now you can marry my daughter"
Then the wedding took place.
All the person_0s and kings of the countries round were asked to come to it , and there were great rejoicings.
After a few days the prince 's son said to his wife , `` Let us go to my father 's country"
There was once upon a time a young peasant named Hans , whose uncle wanted to find him a rich wife.
He therefore seated Hans behind the stove , and had it made very hot.
`` Yes ,"
said Hans , `` I will do all that"
The covetous father asked , `` How is it with regard to his means ? Has he bread to break ?"
`` Dear friend ,"
-LRB- and as he spoke , he slapped the patches on his trousers , but in that district small pieces of land were called patches also.
-RRB- `` If you will give yourself the trouble to go home with me , you shall see at once that all is as I have said"
meaning thereby that his wife should not stare at the broad land , but look at his garment , which was his own.
`` Were you indeed at the wedding ?"
`` Yes , indeed I was there , and in full dress.
My head-dress was of snow ; then the sun came out , and it was melted.
and broke in two"
A greedy Crow , flying near , saw all sorts of delicate food lying about in the kitchen , and fell a-hungering after it.
`` How in the world can I get some ?"
thought he ? At last he hit upon a plan.
When the Pigeon went to search for food , behind him , following , following , came the Crow.
`` What do you want , Mr.
Crow ? You and I do n't feed alike"
`` Ah , but I like you and your ways ! Let me be your chum , and let us feed together"
The Pigeon agreed , and they went on in company.
When he had got a bellyful of them , up he flies , as pert as you like : `` Hullo , Mr.
Pigeon , what a time you take over your meal ! One ought to draw the line somewhere.
Let 's be going home before it is too late"
And so they did.
The cook saw that his Pigeon had brought a friend , and hung up another basket for him.
A few days afterwards there was a great purchase of fish which came to the rich man 's kitchen.
How the Crow longed for some ! So there he lay , from early morn , groaning and making a great noise.
Says the Pigeon to the Crow : `` Come , Sir Crow , and get your breakfast !"
' `` Oh dear ! oh dear ! I have such a fit of indigestion !"
says he.
`` Nonsense ! Crows never have indigestion ,"
said the Pigeon.
Now do what I tell you ; do n't behave in this way just for seeing a little fish"
`` Why do you say that , master ? I have indigestion"
`` Well , be careful ,"
said the Pigeon , and flew away.
The cook prepared all the dishes , and then stood at the kitchen door , wiping the sweat off his body.
`` Now 's my time !"
thought Mr.
Crow , and alighted on a dish containing some dainty food.
Click ! The cook heard it , and looked round.
`` That 's for spoiling my master 's dinner and making me throw it away !"
said he , and threw him into his basket.
Oh , how it hurt ! By-and-by the Pigeon came in , and saw the Crow lying there , making a great noise.
To this the Crow answered with another : `` No tufted crane am I -- no , no ! I 'm nothing but a greedy crow.
I would not do as I was told , So now I 'm plucked , as you behold"
Then the Pigeon flew away , saying : `` I ca n't live with this creature any longer"
And the Crow lay there groaning till he died"
Fatty Coon was very fond of squirrels.
But when I say that Fatty Coon was fond of squirrels , I mean that he liked to eat them.
So of course you will understand now why the squirrels did not care for Fatty at all.
In fact , they usually kept just as far away from him as they could.
But at night -- ah ! that was a very different matter.
Yes -- when the squirrels were in bed at night , up in their nests in the trees , they could see very little.
Fatty thought it great sport to hunt squirrels at night.
Whenever he tried it he usually managed to get a good meal.
But a night came at last when Fatty was well punished for hunting squirrels.
He had climbed half-way to the top of a big chestnut tree , when he spied a hole in the trunk.
He rather thought that some squirrels lived inside that hole.
And as he listened for a few seconds he could hear something moving about inside.
Yes ! Fatty was sure that there was a squirrel in there -- probably several squirrels.
Fatty Coon 's eyes turned green.
And now Fatty was so sure that he was going to have a fine lunch that his eyes turned as green as a cat 's.
He reached a paw inside the hole and felt all around.
WOW ! Fatty gave a cry ; and he pulled his paw out much faster than he had put it in.
Something had given him a cruel dig.
And in a jiffy Fatty saw what that `` something"
was.
It was a grumpy old tramp coon , whom Fatty had never seen before.
`` What do you mean , you young rascal , by disturbing me like this ?"
the ragged stranger cried.
`` Please , sir , I never knew it was you ,"
Fatty stammered.
`` Never knew it was me ! Who did you think it was ?"
`` A -- a squirrel !"
Fatty said faintly.
And he whimpered a little , because his paw hurt him.
`` Ho , ho ! That 's a good one ! That 's a good joke !"
The tramp coon laughed heartily.
And then he scowled so fiercely that poor Fatty nearly tumbled out of the tree.
`` You go home ,"
he said to Fatty.
`` And do n't you let me catch you around here again.
You hear ?"
`` Yes , sir !"
Fatty said.
And home he went.
And you may be sure that he let THAT tree alone after that.
He never went near it again"
When Jasper Jay told person_0 Coon about Farmer Green 's forty fat turkeys person_0 felt hungrier than ever.
`` Oh ! I must n't go near Farmer Green 's house !"
he said.
`` My mother told me to keep away from there.
What time did you say the turkeys go to roost ?"
`` Oh ! they go to roost every night at sundown ,"
Jasper Jay explained.
`` And there they sit , up in the tree , all night long.
They 're fast asleep.
And you would have no trouble at all in catching as many as you wanted.
But of course , if you 're afraid -- why there 's no use of MY talking about it.
There 's a plenty of other coons in these woods who 'd be glad to know about those turkeys.
And maybe they 'd have the manners to say ` Thank you ! ' too"
And with a hoarse , sneering laugh Jasper Jay flew away.
That was enough for person_0.
He made up his mind that he would show Jasper Jay that HE was not afraid.
And he wanted a turkey to eat , too.
He said nothing to his mother about Jasper 's news.
He was not afraid , for he knew that Farmer Green and all his family were in their beds.
And it was so cold that person_0 felt sure that Farmer Green 's dogs would be inside their kennels.
person_0 did not intend to make any noise.
When person_0 Coon came to Farmer Green 's yard he had no trouble at all in finding the spreading oak.
He could see the turkeys plainly where they dozed on the bare branches.
And in less time than it takes to tell it person_0 had climbed the tree.
On the very lowest limb there was a row of four plump turkeys , all sound asleep.
And person_0 reached out and seized the nearest one.
He seized the turkey by the neck , so that the big bird could not call out.
But person_0 was not quite quick enough.
Then the next turkey on the limb woke up.
Farmer Green 's window flew up ; and Farmer Green 's voice called `` Spot ! Spot !"
person_0 Coon did not wait to hear anything more.
He dropped the turkey he had seized and slipped down to the ground.
And then he ran toward the woods as fast as he could go.
Farmer Green 's dog Spot was barking now.
And person_0 wanted to climb one of the trees by the roadside.
But he remembered , the narrow escape he had had when the dog had treed him near the cornfield.
So he never stopped until he reached the woods.
Then he went nimbly up into the trees.
And while Spot was barking at the foot of the first tree he climbed , person_0 was traveling through the tree-tops toward home.
He never said anything to his mother about Farmer Green 's turkeys.
But the next time he saw Jasper Jay person_0 told him exactly what he thought of him.
`` Ha ! ha !"
Jasper Jay only laughed.
And he did not seem at all surprised that person_0 had fallen into trouble.
To tell the truth , he was only sorry because person_0 had escaped.
Jasper Jay did not like person_0 Coon.
And he had told him about the forty fat turkeys because he hoped that person_0 would get caught if he tried to steal one of them.
`` Wait till I catch you !"
person_0 said.
But Jasper Jay only laughed harder than ever when person_0 said that.
He seemed to think it was a great joke.
He was most annoying"
Long , long ago there lived , an old man and.
an old woman ; they were peasants , and had to work hard to earn their daily rice.
One day the old man went to the hills as usual to cut grass and the old woman took some clothes to the river to wash.
.
The old woman at last found a nice spot by the river bank and put her basket down.
The water was as clear as crystal , and she could see the tiny fish swimming to and fro , and the pebbles at the bottom.
As she was busy washing her clothes a great peach came bumping down the stream.
The old woman looked up from her work and saw this large peach.
She was sixty years of age , yet in all her life she had never seen such a big peach as this.
`` How delicious that peach must be !"
she said to herself.
`` I must certainly get it and take it home to my old man"
She stretched out her arm to try and get it , but it was quite out of her reach.
Stopping a moment to think what she would do , she remembered an old charm-verse.
The old woman was delighted.
It seemed a very long time to her to wait till her husband returned.
He seemed very tired and used the scythe for a walking stick , leaning on it as he walked along.
`` What is the matter ? Why are you so impatient ?"
asked the old man , wondering at her unusual eagerness.
`` Has anything happened while I have been away ?"
`` Oh , no !"
answered the old woman , `` nothing has happened , only I have found a nice present for you !"
`` That is good ,"
said the old man.
He then washed his feet in a basin of water and stepped up to the veranda.
The old woman now ran into the little room and brought out from the cupboard the big peach.
It felt even heavier than before.
She held it up to him , saying : `` Just look at this ! Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life ?"
`` I did not buy it ,"
answered the old woman.
`` I found it in the river where I was washing"
And she told him the whole story.
`` I am very glad that you have found it.
Let us eat it now , for I am hungry ,"
said the O Fii San.
and out stepped a beautiful little child.
The old man and his wife were both so astonished at what they saw that they fell to the ground.
The child spoke again : `` Do n't be afraid.
I am no demon or fairy.
I will tell you the truth.
Heaven has had compassion on you.
Every day and every night you have lamented that you had no child.
Your cry has been heard and I am sent to be the son of your old age !"
On hearing this the old man and his wife were very happy.
The years passed quickly by and the child grew to be fifteen years of age.
The old couple 's pleasure was very great when they looked at him , for he was just what they thought a hero ought to be like.
One day person_0 came to his foster-father and said solemnly : `` Father , by a strange chance we have become father and son.
I do not know how to thank you enough"
`` Why ,"
answered the old man , `` it is a matter of course that a father should bring up his son.
Indeed , I am rather surprised that you should thank me in this way !"
and the old man looked bothered.
`` I hope you will be patient with me ,"
`` I will let you do whatever you wish , for you are quite different to all other boys !"
`` Then let me go away at once !"
`` What do you say ? Do you wish to leave your old father and mother and go away from your old home ?"
`` I will surely come back again , if you let me go now !"
`` Where are you going ?"
`` You must think it strange that I want to go away ,"
said person_0 , `` because I have not yet told you my reason.
Far away from here to the northeast of Japan there is an island in the sea.
This island is the stronghold of a band of devils.
I have often heard how they invade this land , kill and rob the people , and carry off all they can find.
They are not only very wicked but they are disloyal to our Emperor and disobey his laws.
They are also cannibals , for they kill and eat some of the poor people who are so unfortunate as to fall into their hands.
These devils are very hateful beings.
I must go and conquer them and bring back all the plunder of which they have robbed this land.
It is for this reason that I want to go away for a short time !"
The old man was much surprised at hearing all this from a mere boy of fifteen.
He thought it best to let the boy go.
`` All you say is very interesting , person_0 ,"
said the old man.
`` I will not hinder you in your determination.
You may go if you wish.
Go to the island as soon as ever you like and destroy the demons and bring peace to the land"
`` Thank you , for all your kindness ,"
said person_0 , who began to get ready to go that very day.
He was full of courage and did not know what fear was.
At last the cakes were made and person_0 was ready to start on his long journey.
Parting is always sad.
So it was now.
The eyes of the two old people were filled with tears and their voices trembled as they said : `` Go with all care and speed.
We expect you back victorious !"
But he said `` Good-by !"
quite bravely.
`` I am going now.
Take good care of yourselves while I am away.
Good - by !"
And he stepped quickly out of the house.
In silence the eyes of person_0 and his parents met in farewell.
person_0 now hurried on his way till it was midday.
While he was thus having his lunch a dog almost as large as a colt came running out from the high grass.
If you leave me all the cakes you have in your bag you may go ; otherwise I will bite you till I kill you !"
If you try to stop me on my way there I will cut you in two from the head downwards !"
The dog 's manner at once changed.
His tail dropped between his legs , and coming near he bowed so low that his forehead touched the ground.
`` What do I hear ? The name of person_0 ? Are you indeed person_0 ? I have often heard of your great strength.
Not knowing who you were I have behaved in a very stupid way.
`` I think I can take you with me if you wish to go ,"
said person_0.
`` Thank you !"
said the dog.
`` By the way , I am very very hungry.
Will you give me one of the cakes you are carrying ?"
`` This is the best kind of cake there is in Japan ,"
said person_0.
`` I can not spare you a whole one ; I will give you half of one"
`` Thank you very much ,"
said the dog , taking the piece thrown to him.
Then person_0 got up and the dog followed.
For a long time they walked over the hills and through the valleys.
As they were going along an animal came down from a tree a little ahead of them.
The creature soon came up to person_0 and said : `` Good morning , person_0 ! You are welcome in this part of the country.
Will you allow me to go with you ?"
The dog answered jealously : `` person_0 already has a dog to accompany him.
Of what use is a monkey like you in battle ? We are on our way to fight the devils ! Get away !"
The dog and the monkey began to quarrel and bite , for these two animals always hate each other.
`` Now , do n't quarrel !"
said person_0 , putting himself between them.
`` Wait a moment , dog !"
`` It is not at all dignified for you to have such a creature as that following you !"
said the dog.
`` What do you know about it ?"
asked person_0 ; and pushing aside the dog , he spoke to the monkey : `` Who are you ?"
`` I am a monkey living in these hills ,"
replied the monkey"
I heard of your expedition to the Island of Devils , and I have come to go with you.
Nothing will please me more than to follow you !"
`` Do you really wish to go to the Island of Devils and fight with me ?"
`` Yes , sir ,"
replied the monkey.
`` I admire your courage ,"
said person_0.
`` Here is a piece of one of my fine rice-cakes.
Come along !"
So the monkey joined person_0.
The dog and the monkey did not get on well together.
They were always snapping at each other as they went along , and always wanting to have a fight.
By and by they came to a large field.
Here a bird flew down and alighted on the ground just in front of the little party.
It was the most beautiful bird person_0 had ever seen.
On its body were five different robes of feathers and its head was covered with a scarlet cap.
The dog at once ran at the bird and tried to seize and kill it.
But the bird struck out its spurs and flew at the dog 's tail , and the fight went hard with both.
person_0 , as he looked on , could not help admiring the bird ; it showed so much spirit in the fight.
It would certainly make a good fighter.
Surrender at once , and I will take you with me.
If you do n't I will set this dog to bite your head off !"
Then the bird surrendered at once , and begged to be taken into person_0 's company.
`` I do not know what excuse to offer for quarreling with the dog , your servant , but I did not see you.
I am a miserable bird called a pheasant.
It is very generous of you to pardon my rudeness and to take me with you.
Please allow me to follow you behind the dog and the monkey !"
`` I congratulate you on surrendering so soon ,"
said person_0 , smiling.
`` Come and join us in our raid on the devils"
`` Are you going to take this bird with you also ?"
asked the dog , interrupting.
`` Why do you ask such an unnecessary question ? Did n't you hear what I said ? I take the bird with me because I wish to !"
`` Humph !"
said the dog.
Then person_0 stood and gave this order : `` Now all of you must listen to me.
The first thing necessary in an army is harmony.
When we are not at peace amongst ourselves it is no easy thing to subdue an enemy.
From now , you three , the dog , the monkey and the pheasant , must be friends with one mind.
The one who first begins a quarrel will be discharged on the spot !"
All the three promised not to quarrel.
The pheasant was now made a member of person_0 's suite , and received half a cake.
person_0 's influence was so great that the three became good friends , and hurried onwards with him as their leader.
Hurrying on day after day they at last came out upon the shore of the North-Eastern Sea.
There was nothing to be seen as far as the horizon -- not a sign of any island.
All that broke the stillness was the rolling of the waves upon the shore.
It will be far better for me to go alone.
I discharge you all at once !"
The three animals were taken aback at this sharp reproof , and clung to person_0 's sleeve , begging him not to send them away.
`` Please , person_0 !"
said the dog.
`` We have come thus far !"
said the monkey.
`` It is inhuman to leave us here !"
said the pheasant.
`` We are not at all afraid of the sea ,"
said the monkey again.
`` Please do take us with you ,"
said the pheasant.
`` Do please ,"
said the dog.
They had now gained a little courage , so person_0 said : `` Well , then , I will take you with me , but be careful !"
person_0 now got a small ship , and they all got on board.
The wind and weather were fair , and the ship went like an arrow over the sea.
Every day they paced the deck of their little ship , eagerly looking out for the demons ' island.
He longed to be at work killing the monsters who had done so much harm in his country.
person_0 knew at once that what they saw was the devils ' stronghold.
On the top of the precipitous shore , looking out to sea , was a large castle.
His three followers watched him , waiting for orders.
At last he called to the pheasant : `` It is a great advantage for us to have you with us"
said person_0 to the bird , `` for you have good wings.
Fly at once to the castle and engage the demons to fight.
We will follow you"
The pheasant at once obeyed.
He flew off from the ship beating the air gladly with his wings.
Wait till you get a blow from one of our iron bars !"
Very angry , indeed , were the devils.
They shook their horns and their shocks of red hair fiercely , and rushed to put on tiger skin trousers to make themselves look more terrible.
They then brought out great iron bars and ran to where the pheasant perched over their heads , and tried to knock him down.
The pheasant flew to one side to escape the blow , and then attacked the head of first one and then another demon.
In the meantime , person_0 had brought his ship to land.
They soon came upon two beautiful damsels washing clothes in a stream.
person_0 saw that the clothes were blood-stained , and that as the two maidens washed , the tears were falling fast down their cheeks.
He stopped and spoke to them : `` Who are you , and why do you weep ?"
`` We are captives of the Demon King.
-- and the maidens held up the blood-stained clothes -- `` and eat us , and there is no one to help us !"
And their tears burst out afresh at this horrible thought.
`` I will rescue you ,"
said person_0.
`` Do not weep any more , only show me how I may get into the castle"
The pheasant , who was all this time fighting hard , saw person_0 and his little band rush in at the back.
person_0 's onslaught was so furious that the devils could not stand against him.
The chief of the devils at last was the only one left.
He made up his mind to surrender , for he knew that his enemy was stronger than mortal man.
`` I am afraid of you ,"
he said meekly.
`` I can not stand against you.
I will give you all the treasure hidden in this castle if you will spare my life !"
person_0 laughed.
Then person_0 tied the devil chief up and gave him into the monkey 's charge.
Having done this , he went into all the rooms of the castle and set the prisoners free and gathered together all the treasure he found.
Long , long ago , in old Japan , the person_0dom of the Sea was governed by a wonderful person_0.
He was called Rin Jin , or the person_1 of the Sea.
The walls were of coral , the roof of jadestone and chrysoprase , and the floors were of the finest mother-of-pearl.
At last he thought that if he married he would not only be happier , but also more powerful.
So he decided to take a wife.
At last they returned to the Palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon.
All the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned them.
The person_0 fell in love with her at once , and the wedding ceremony was celebrated with great splendor.
Never had there been such an assemblage or such gay festivities in the Fish-World before.
Now for a time the person_1 and his bride lived very happily.
Life seemed to them both like a long summer 's day.
Two months passed in this happy way , and then the person_1 Queen fell ill and was obliged to stay in bed.
Then the person_1 interviewed the doctor and blamed him for not curing the Queen.
`` Do you mean to tell me that you ca n't get the medicine here ?"
asked the person_1.
`` It is just as you say !"
said the doctor.
`` Tell me what it is you want for the Queen ?"
demanded Rin Jin.
`` I want the liver of a live monkey !"
answered the doctor.
`` The liver of a live monkey ! Of course that will be most difficult to get ,"
said the person_0.
`` If we could only get that for the Queen , Her Majesty would soon recover ,"
said the doctor.
`` Very well , that decides it ; we MUST get it somehow or other.
But where are we most likely to find a monkey ?"
asked the person_0.
Then the doctor told the person_1 that some distance to the south there was a Monkey Island where a great many monkeys lived.
`` If only you could capture one of these monkeys ?"
said the doctor.
`` How can any of my people capture a monkey ?"
said the person_1 , greatly puzzled.
`` That has been my difficulty too ,"
said the doctor.
`` But amongst your innumerable servants you surely can find one who can go on shore for that express purpose !"
`` Something must be done ,"
said the person_0 , and calling his chief steward he consulted him on the matter.
He is certainly ugly to look at , but he is proud of being able to walk on land with his four legs like a tortoise.
Let us send him to the Island of Monkeys to catch one"
The jelly fish was then summoned to the person_0 's presence , and was told by His Majesty what was required of him.
`` Well ,"
said the chief steward , `` if you depend on your strength or dexterity you will never catch a monkey.
The only way is to play a trick on one !"
`` How can I play a trick on a monkey ? I do n't know how to do it ,"
said the perplexed jelly fish.
`` This is what you must do ,"
said the wily chief steward.
`` When you approach the Island of Monkeys and meet some of them , you must try to get very friendly with one.
Tell him that you are a servant of the person_1 , and invite him to come and visit you and see the person_1 's Palace.
`` But how am I to get the monkey here ? You know monkeys do n't swim ?"
said the reluctant jelly fish.
`` You must carry him on your back.
What is the use of your shell if you ca n't do that !"
said the chief steward.
`` Wo n't he be very heavy ?"
queried kurage again.
`` You must n't mind that , for you are working for the person_1 ,"
replied the chief steward.
`` I will do my best then ,"
said the jelly fish , and he swam away from the Palace and started off towards the Monkey Island.
Swimming swiftly he reached his destination in a few hours , and landed by a convenient wave upon the shore.
`` I 'm in luck !"
thought the jelly fish.
`` Now I must flatter the creature and try to entice him to come back with me to the Palace , and my part will be done !"
So the jelly fish slowly walked towards the pine-tree.
In those ancient days the jelly fish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise.
When he got to the pine-tree he raised his voice and said : `` How do you do , Mr.
Monkey ? Is n't it a lovely day ?"
`` A very fine day ,"
answered the monkey from the tree.
`` I have never seen you in this part of the world before.
Where have you come from and what is your name ?"
`` My name is kurage or jelly fish.
I am one of the servants of the person_1.
I have heard so much of your beautiful island that I have come on purpose to see it ,"
answered the jelly fish.
`` I am very glad to see you ,"
said the monkey.
`` By the bye ,"
said the jelly fish , `` have you ever seen the Palace of the person_1 of the Sea where I live ?"
`` I have often heard of it , but I have never seen it !"
answered the monkey.
`` Then you ought most surely to come.
It is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it.
The beauty of the Palace is beyond all description -- it is certainly to my mind the most lovely place in the world ,"
said the jelly fish.
`` Is it so beautiful as all that ?"
asked the monkey in astonishment.
`` I have got him at last !"
thought the jelly fish , but aloud he said : `` Mr.
Monkey.
I must now go back.
`` I should love to go ,"
said the monkey , `` but how am I to cross the water ! I ca n't swim , as you surely know !"
`` There is no difficulty about that.
I can carry you on my back"
`` That will be troubling you too much ,"
said the monkey.
`` I can do it quite easily.
I am stronger than I look , so you need n't hesitate ,"
said the jelly fish , and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea.
`` Keep very still , Mr.
monkey ,"
said the jelly fish.
`` You must n't fall into the sea ; I am responsible for your safe arrival at the person_0 's Palace"
`` Please do n't go so fast , or I am sure I shall fall off ,"
said the monkey.
Thus they went along , the jelly fish skimming through the waves with the monkey sitting on his back.
Monkey , tell me , have you such a thing as a liver with you ?"
The monkey was very much surprised at this queer question , and asked what the jelly fish wanted with a liver.
`` That is the most important thing of all ,"
said the stupid jelly fish , `` so as soon as I recollected it , I asked you if you had yours with you ?"
`` Why is my liver so important to you ?"
asked the monkey.
`` Oh ! you will learn the reason later ,"
said the jelly fish.
Then the jelly fish , seeing how anxious the monkey looked , was sorry for him , and told him everything.
said the silly jelly fish.
The poor monkey was horrified when he learned all this , and very angry at the trick played upon him.
He trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him.
`` The doctor means to cut me open and then take my liver out ! Why I shall die !"
thought the monkey.
At last a bright thought struck him , so he said quite cheerfully to the jelly fish : `` What a pity it was , Mr.
Jelly Fish , that you did not speak of this before we left the island !"
`` If I had told why I wanted you to accompany me you would certainly have refused to come ,"
answered the jelly fish.
`` You are quite mistaken ,"
said the monkey.
`` Monkeys can very well spare a liver or two , especially when it is wanted for the person_1 Queen of the Sea.
If I had only guessed of what you were in need.
I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked.
I have several livers.
But the greatest pity is , that as you did not speak in time , I have left all my livers hanging on the pine-tree"
`` Have you left your liver behind you ?"
asked the jelly fish.
`` Yes ,"
To-day , listening to your interesting conversation , I quite forgot it , and left it behind when I came off with you.
If only you had spoken in time I should have remembered it , and should have brought it along with me !"
The jelly fish was very disappointed when he heard this , for he believed every word the monkey said.
The monkey was of no good without a liver.
Finally the jelly fish stopped and told the monkey so.
`` Well ,"
said the monkey , `` that is soon remedied.
Thus persuaded , the jelly fish turned his course towards the Monkey Island once more.
The jelly fish wondered at this speech and the mocking tone in which it was uttered.
Then he asked the monkey if it was n't his intention to come with him at once after getting his liver.
The monkey replied laughingly that he could n't afford to lose his liver : it was too precious.
`` But remember your promise !"
pleaded the jelly fish , now very discouraged.
`` That promise was false , and anyhow it is now broken !"
answered the monkey.
`` Of course , I wo n't GIVE you my liver , but come and get it if you can !"
added the monkey mockingly from the tree.
The last thing he heard as he glided away , leaving the island behind him , was the monkey laughing at him.
Meanwhile the person_1 , the doctor , the chief steward , and all the servants were waiting impatiently for the return of the jelly fish.
When they caught sight of him approaching the Palace , they hailed him with delight.
Now the day of reckoning had come for the jelly fish.
He quaked all over as he told his story.
The person_1 's wrath was great , and he at once gave orders that the jelly fish was to be severely punished.
The punishment was a horrible one.
All the bones were to be drawn out from his living body , and he was to be beaten with sticks.
The poor jelly fish , humiliated and horrified beyond all words , cried out for pardon.
But the person_1 's order had to be obeyed.
Here he was left to suffer and repent his foolish chattering , and to grow accustomed to his new state of bonelessness.
`` Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
It sounds up from the `` bell-deep ,"
in the Odense-Au.
Opposite the old nunnery is the deepest place , which is called the `` bell-deep ,"
and there dwells the old water spirit , the `` Au-mann"
This spirit sleeps through the day while the sun shines down upon the water ; but in starry and moonlit nights he shows himself.
Once the bell hung in the church tower ; but now there is no trace left of the tower or of the church , which was called St.
Alban 's.
`` Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
`` Ding-dong ! ding-dong ! Now I 'll retire to rest !"
sang the bell , and flew down into the Odense-Au where it is deepest ; and that is why the place is called the `` bell-deep"
But the bell got neither rest nor sleep.
-LRB- Illustration : THE AU-MANN LISTENING TO THE BELL.
Alban , the monk mounted up into the tower.
He was young and handsome , but thoughtful exceedingly.
Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
Yes , this was the story the bell told.
He sat down close under me , and played with two little sticks as if they had been a stringed instrument ; and he sang to it.
` Now I may sing it out aloud , though at other times I may not whisper it.
I may sing of everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars.
Yonder it is cold and wet.
' `` There was a king in those days ; they called him Canute.
He sought shelter in the church , and shut gate and door behind him.
The violent band surrounded the church ; I heard tell of it.
The crows , ravens , and magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that sounded around.
Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
Thus it sounds complainingly out of the bell-deep in the Odense-Au : that is what grandmother told us.
`` Be cautious , cautious , and take good heed to thyself ,"
they both say.
The air knows everything.
High up yonder , in the thin clear air , flew an angel with a flower from the heavenly garden.
`` A funny kind of slip that ,"
said the plants.
And neither thistle nor stinging-nettle would recognize the stranger.
`` That must be a kind of garden plant ,"
said they.
And they sneered ; and the plant was despised by them as being a thing out of the garden.
`` Where are you coming ?"
cried the lofty thistles , whose leaves are all armed with thorns.
`` You give yourself a good deal of space.
That 's all nonsense -- we are not here to support you !"
they grumbled.
When spring came , the plant appeared as a blooming object , more beautiful than any production of the forest.
And now appeared on the scene the botanical professor , who could show what he was in black and white.
`` That must be some subordinate species ,"
he said.
`` I do n't know it.
It 's not included in any system"
`` Not included in any system !"
repeated the thistles and the nettles.
There came through the forest a poor innocent girl.
Her heart was pure , and her understanding was enlarged by faith.
They imagined evil in their hearts , but God turned it to good.
But the wonderful plant still bloomed without in the forest.
It was almost like a tree to look upon ; and all the birds of passage bowed before it.
`` That 's giving itself foreign airs now ,"
said the thistles and the burdocks ; `` we never behave like that here"
And the black snails actually spat at the flower.
Then came the swineherd.
He was collecting thistles and shrubs , to burn them for the ashes.
The wonderful plant was placed bodily in his bundle.
`` It shall be made useful ,"
he said ; and so said , so done.
-LRB- Illustration : THE POOR GIRL 'S TREASURE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa But soon afterwards , the king of the country was troubled with a terrible depression of spirits.
He was busy and industrious , but that did him no good.
He said : `` In the king 's own country there grows in a forest a plant of heavenly origin.
Its appearance is thus and thus.
It can not be mistaken"
`` I fancy it was taken up in my bundle , and burnt to ashes long ago ,"
said the swineherd ; `` but I did not know any better"
`` You did n't know any better ! Ignorance of ignorances !"
And those words the swineherd might well take to himself , for they were meant for him , and for no one else.
Not another leaf was to be found ; the only one lay in the coffin of the dead girl , and no one knew anything about that.
And the king himself , in his melancholy , wandered out to the spot in the wood.
`` Here is where the plant stood ,"
he said ; `` it is a sacred place"
And the place was surrounded with a golden railing , and a sentry was posted there.
The botanical professor wrote a long treatise upon the heavenly plant.
For this he was gilded all over , and this gilding suited him and his family very well.
And indeed that was the most agreeable part of the whole story.
But the king remained as low-spirited as before ; but that he had always been , at least so the sentry said"
There was a certain Brahman in a certain village , named person_0.
He wandered about begging with his family , and at last he reached a certain city , and entered the service of a rich householder called Sthuladatta.
While he was anxiously expecting to be fed , no one thought of him.
and Sthuladatta then propitiated the Brahman with these words -- `` I forgot you , forgive me"
-- and asked him to tell him who had taken away their horse.
It is concealed there , and before it is carried off to a distance , as it will be at close of day , go quickly and bring it"
When they heard that , many men ran and brought the horse quickly , praising the discernment of person_0.
Then person_0 was honored by all men as a sage , and dwelt there in happiness , honored by Sthuladatta.
As the thief was not known , the king quickly summoned person_0 on account of his reputation for knowledge of magic.
And he , when summoned , tried to gain time , and said , `` I will tell you to-morrow ,"
and then he was placed in a chamber by the king , and carefully guarded.
And he was sad because he had pretended to have knowledge.
And person_0 , who was alone inside , was at that very moment blaming his own tongue , that had made a vain assumption of knowledge.
He said : `` O Tongue , what is this that you have done through your greediness ? Wicked one , you will soon receive punishment in full"
So spare me , and receive the small quantity of gold which is in my possession"
But whatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me"
When he said this to the maid , she consented , and departed quickly.
Secret crimes manifest themselves by means of fear"
Thus thinking , he passed the night happily in the chamber.
Then the king was pleased , and gave him the revenue of many villages.
It will be much better to test him by some new artifice"
When the Brahman person_0 heard that , he thought that his last hour had come , and he called to mind the pet name of `` Froggie"
So person_0 prospered in the world"
The following story is one of the strangest that ever was heard.
Two black dogs long dwelt with me in my house , and were very affectionately disposed towards me.
These two black dogs and myself were sisters , and I shall acquaint you by what strange accident they came to be metamorphosed.
After our father 's death , the estate that he left was equally divided among us.
My two sisters and myself stayed with our mother , who was still alive , and when she died she left each of us a thousand sequins.
Assure yourself that there is nothing I have but is at your service , and as much at your disposal as my own.
` But , ' said I , ' I rather believe you have a mind to marry again.
Believe what I say , and let us live together as comfortably as we can.
' All my persuasion was in vain ; they were resolved to marry , and so they did.
But after some months were past they came back again , and begged my pardon a thousand times for not following my advice.
' Upon this I embraced them again , and we lived together as we did formerly.
I entered the town and passed through the several streets , wherein men stood everywhere in various attitudes , but all motionless and petrified.
On that side where the merchants lived I found most of the shops shut , and in such as were open I likewise found the people petrified.
I went from thence into a room richly hung and furnished , where I perceived a lady.
What surprised me more than all the rest was a sparkling light which came from above the bed.
The doors being all open , or but half shut , I surveyed some other apartments that were as fine as those I had already seen.
Meantime night came on , which put me in mind that it was time to retire.
I laid myself down upon the couch , not without some dread of being alone in a desolate place ; and this fear hindered my sleep.
I set down my torch upon the ground , and looking through a window I found it to be an oratory.
At the sight of this I was transported with wonder.
Hear me , O Lord , and grant my request.
` My dear lady , ' said the young man , ` have patience for a moment.
' At these words he shut the Koran , put it into a rich case , and laid it in the niche.
I took that opportunity of observing him , and perceived so much good-nature and beauty in him that I felt strange emotion.
I will acquaint you with the most remarkable effect of His greatness and power.
You must know that this city was the metropolis of a mighty kingdom , over which the king , my father , did reign.
`` Dear prince ,"
would she oftentimes say , `` there is but one true God ; take heed that you do not acknowledge and adore any other"
She taught me to read Arabic , and the book she gave me to practice upon was the Koran.
She happened to die , but not before she had instructed me in all that was necessary to convince me of the truth of the Mussulman religion.
After her death I persisted with constancy in this belief ; and I abhor the false god Nardoun , and the adoration of fire.
The words were these : `` Inhabitants , abandon the worship of Nardoun , and of fire , and worship the only God that shows mercy"
' He accepted the offer , and we discoursed the remaining part of the night about our sailing.
We left the furniture and goods , which consisted of an infinite quantity of plate , etc.
Nor will I pretend to have any power over your actions.
' At these words my sisters changed color , and I could perceive afterwards that they did not love me as formerly.
They did the same to the prince , who was drowned.
I swam for some minutes in the water ; but by good fortune , or rather miracle , I soon felt ground.
When day came , I found it to be a desert island , lying about twenty miles from Balsora.
.
I arose , and saw a larger serpent following him , holding him by the tail , and endeavoring to devour him.
The other , finding himself at liberty , took to his wings and flew away.
I sat up and asked her who she was.
' I am , ' said she , ` the serpent whom you delivered not long since from my mortal enemy.
I knew not how to acknowledge the great kindness you did me , but by doing what I have done.
We have carried into your storehouses at Bagdad all your lading that was in your vessel , and afterwards sunk it.
` These two black dogs are your sisters , whom I have transformed into this shape.
But this punishment is not sufficient ; for I will have you treat them after such a manner as I shall direct.
' I was forced to promise that I would obey her order.
For many months I whipped them every night , though with regret.
I gave evidence by my tears with how much sorrow and reluctance I must perform this cruel duty.
The house began to shake at that very instant , and the fairy appeared in the form of a lady very richly dressed.
They immediately became two ladies of surprising beauty , and I recognized in them the sisters to whose human form I had so long been a stranger.
They soon after married the sons of kings , and lived happily for the rest of their lives"
It was in the month of May.
The wind still blew cold , but bushes and trees , field and meadow , all alike said the spring had come.
And the branch was most carefully broken off , and she held it in her delicate hand , and sheltered it with her silk parasol.
Then they drove to the castle , where there were lofty halls and splendid apartments.
It was charming to behold.
But the branch became proud ; and this was quite like human nature.
People of various kinds came through the room , and according to their rank they might express their admiration.
`` Some are created for beauty , and some for use ; and there are some which one can do without altogether ,"
`` Poor despised herbs !"
said the apple branch.
`` There is certainly a difference ! And how unhappy they must feel , if indeed that kind can feel like myself and my equals.
Certainly there is a difference , and distinctions must be made , or we should all be equal"
or `` dog-flower"
`` Poor despised plants !"
said the apple branch.
`` It is not your fault that you received the ugly name you bear.
But it is with plants as with men -- there must be a difference !"
`` A difference ?"
The sunbeam , the ray of light , knew better ; and said , `` You do n't see far , and you do n't see clearly.
What is the despised plant that you especially pity ?"
`` The dandelion ,"
replied the apple branch.
`` It is never received into a nosegay ; it is trodden under foot.
They are nothing but weeds -- but it is right there should be weeds too.
Oh , I 'm really very thankful that I was not created one of those flowers"
So on this occasion the despised flower was actually raised to the rank of a prophet or augur.
`` Do you see ?"
said the sunbeam.
`` Do you see the beauty of those flowers ? do you see their power ?"
`` Yes , over children ,"
replied the apple branch.
With some of the roots she intended to make tea for herself ; others she was going to sell for money to the druggist.
`` But beauty is a higher thing !"
said the apple tree branch.
`` Only the chosen few can be admitted into the realm of beauty.
There is a difference among plants , just as there is a difference among men"
`` Yes , yes , that is your opinion ,"
the apple branch persisted.
She carried in her hand a flower , or something of the kind.
`` Look , with what singular beauty Providence has invested it ,"
she said.
And the sunbeam kissed the humble flower , and he kissed the blooming apple branch , whose leaves appeared covered with a roseate blush"
PERFUMED , quite neat , and lively as a bird , Our spark -LRB- safe entered -RRB- uttered not a word.
A singularity we needs must own , With this the wife was long familiar grown.
WITH perfect justice Heav ` n its gifts bestows ; But equal talents all should not compose.
The prince 's virtues doubtless were designed , To take command , and govern o ` er mankind.
The lawyer , points of difficulty views , Decides with judgment , and the truth pursues.
In Cupid 's scenes the muleteer succeeds : -- Each has his part : -- none universal meeds.
WITH pleasures feasted , our gallant retired , Before the morn fresh blushes had acquired.
For heav 'n' s sake , consider more your health ; ` Tis dearer far to me than Croesus ' wealth.
WITHIN the royal breast suspicions rose , But nothing then the monarch would disclose.
In doubt how this adventure yet might end , He thought to seem asleep would him befriend.
MEANWHILE the king , though not without much pains , Obtained the scissors used for horses ' manes.
With these , he said , I 'll mark the fond gallant , That I may know again the one I want.
THE monarch from the muleteer with care , In front , snipt off a bulky lock of hair.
Well ! well ! he 'll now escape if mum he prove ; But there again I trust he ne'er shall move"
Once there was a miller who was poor , but who had a beautiful daughter.
Thereupon he himself locked up the room , and left her in it alone.
`` Alas !"
answered the girl , `` I have to spin straw into gold , and I do not know how to do it"
`` What will you give me ,"
said the manikin , `` if I do it for you ?"
`` My necklace ,"
said the girl.
The little man took the necklace , seated himself in front of the wheel , and `` whirr , whirr , whirr ,"
And so it went on until the morning , when all the straw was spun , and all the reels were full of gold.
By daybreak the King was already there , and when he saw the gold he was astonished and delighted , but his heart became only more greedy.
`` The ring on my finger ,"
answered the girl.
The little man took the ring , again began to turn the wheel , and by morning had spun all the straw into glittering gold.
`` Even if she be a miller 's daughter ,"
thought he , `` I could not find a richer wife in the whole world"
`` I have nothing left that I could give ,"
answered the girl.
`` Then promise me , if you should become person_0 , your first child"
`` Who knows whether that will ever happen ?"
A year after , she had a beautiful child , and she never gave a thought to the manikin.
But suddenly he came into her room , and said , `` Now give me what you promised"
The person_0 was horror-struck , and offered the manikin all the riches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child.
But the manikin said , `` No , something that is living is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world"
Then the person_0 began to weep and cry , so that the manikin pitied her.
`` I will give you three days ' time ,"
said he , `` if by that time you find out my name , then shall you keep your child"
`` Perhaps your name is Shortribs , or Sheepshanks , or Laceleg ?"
but he always answered , `` That is not my name"
Ha ! glad am I that no one knew That Rumpelstiltskin I am styled"
at first she said , `` Is your name Conrad ?"
`` No"
`` Is your name Harry ?"
`` No"
`` Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin ?"
`` The devil has told you that ! the devil has told you that !"
Twelve servants who had done nothing all the day would not exert themselves at night either , but laid themselves on the grass and boasted of their idleness.
When I have had four meals , I fast a short time until I feel hunger again , and that suits me best.
To rise betimes is not for me ; when it is getting near mid-day , I already seek out a resting-place for myself.
In this way life is endurable"
I , however , lay myself in the oat-chest and sleep for four hours.
After this I stretch out one foot and move it a couple of times over the horse 's body , and then he is combed and cleaned.
Who is going to make a great business of that ? Nevertheless service is too toilsome for me"
The third said , `` Why plague oneself with work ? Nothing comes of it ! I laid myself in the sun , and fell asleep.
It began to rain a little , but why should I get up ? I let it rain on in God 's name.
I have already had several injuries of that kind"
After that I begin quite slowly , and ask if no one is there who could help me.
Then I let him do the chief of the work , and in reality only look on ; but that also is still too much for me"
It is enough and to spare if I take out a cartful in the day.
I have no fancy for killing myself with work"
What is the use of buckling your shoes on ? For aught I care they may fall off my feet , it is no matter.
The seventh said , `` That will not do with me ; my master looks after my work , only he is not at home the whole day.
But I neglect nothing , I run as fast as it is possible to do when one crawls.
If I am to get on , four sturdy men must push me with all their might.
I came where six men were lying sleeping on a bed beside each other.
I lay down by them and slept too.
There was no wakening me again , and when they wanted to have me home , they had to carry me"
At the very most , I only turn myself so that it can shine on me"
Just to turn myself round was too much for me , I remained lying like a log the whole day"
The tenth said , `` Laziness has brought misfortune on me , a broken leg and swollen calf.
Three of us were lying in the road , and I had my legs stretched out.
Some one came with a cart , and the wheels went over me.
The eleventh said , `` I gave up my place yesterday.
I had no fancy for carrying the heavy books to my master any longer or fetching them away again.
There was no end of it all day long.
Some one had come by , who had carried all off.
Besides this , the cart had got into a quagmire and stuck fast.
I left it standing , and stretched myself on the straw again.
A clever John of this kind was once sent out by his master to seek a lost cow.
He stayed away a long time , and the master thought , `` Faithful John does not spare any pains over his work !"
He had to search a long time , but at last he perceived the boy who was running up and down a large field.
`` Now , dear John ,"
said the master when he had got up to him , `` hast thou found the cow which I sent thee to seek ?"
`` No , master ,"
he answered , `` I have not found the cow , but then I have not looked for it"
`` Then what hast thou looked for , John ?"
`` Something better , and that luckily I have found"
`` What is that , John ?"
`` Three blackbirds ,"
answered the boy.
`` And where are they ?"
asked the master.
`` I see one of them , I hear the other , and I am running after the third ,"
answered the wise boy.
Each of them only bore his human form for only two hours daily.
The third son , who was afraid she might change him into a raging wild beast a bear perhaps , or a wolf , went secretly away.
He had heard that a King 's daughter who was bewitched , was imprisoned in the Castle of the Golden Sun , and was waiting for deliverance.
And as his heart was without fear , he caught at the idea of seeking out the Castle of the Golden Sun.
The small men are cleverer than we are , so we will leave the decision to thee"
`` How can you dispute about an old cap ?"
said the youth.
`` Give me the cap ,"
He put it on and went away , and thought of the King 's daughter , forgot the giants , and walked continually onward.
and hardly had the words passed his lips than he was standing on a high mountain before the gate of the castle.
He entered and went through all the rooms , until in the last he found the King 's daughter.
But how shocked he was when he saw her.
She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles , blear eyes , and red hair.
`` Are you the King 's daughter , whose beauty the whole world praises ?"
cried he.
`` Ah ,"
Then said he , `` How canst thou be set free ? I fear no danger"
Ah ,"
`` Nothing can keep me from doing it ,"
said he , `` but tell me what I must do"
`` Thou shalt know everything ,"
The youth went down to the spring , where the bull snorted and bellowed at him.
After a long struggle he plunged his sword in the animal 's body , and it fell down.
Then arose in the sea waves as high as a house , they streamed over the hut , and subdued the fire.
The other brother , the whale , had come swimming to them , and had driven the water up on high.
With this canst thou likewise give back to thy brothers their human form"
I further considered that by my irregular way of living I had wretchedly misspent my time which is the most valuable thing in the world.
Struck with those reflections , I collected the remains of my furniture , and sold all my patrimony by public auction to the highest bidder.
At first I was troubled with sea-sickness , but speedily recovered my health , and was not afterwards troubled with that disease.
In our voyage we touched at several islands , where we sold or exchanged our goods.
Thus was I exposed to the mercy of the waves , and struggled for my life all the rest of the day and the following night.
Next morning I found my strength gone , and despaired of saving my life , when happily a wave threw me against an island.
I went towards him , between hope and fear , not knowing whether I was going to lose my life or save it.
Presently I heard the voice of a man from under ground , who immediately appeared to me , and asked who I was.
I ate some victuals which they offered me , and then asked them what they did in such a desert place.
They answered that they were grooms belonging to King Mihrage , sovereign of the island , and that every year they brought thither the king 's horses.
Next morning they returned with their horses to the capital of the island , took me with them , and presented me to King Mihrage.
There belonged to this king an island named Cassel.
They assured me that every night a noise of drums was heard there , whence the mariners fancied that it was the residence of Degial.
I saw likewise other fishes , about a cubit in length , that had heads like owls.
I also knew the captain ; but being persuaded that he believed me to be drowned , I went and asked him whose bales they were.
' ` Captain , ' said I , ` I am that Sinbad whom you thought to be dead , and those bales are mine.
' ` Have patience , captain , ' replied I ; ` do me the favor to hear what I have to say.
' ` Very well , ' said he , ` speak ; I am ready to hear you.
' I thanked him , acknowledged his honesty , and in return offered him part of my goods as a present , which he generously refused.
I acquainted him with the whole story.
He was mightily pleased at my good luck , accepted my present , and gave me one much more considerable in return.
Upon this I took leave of him , and went aboard the same ship , after I had exchanged my goods for the commodities of that country.
I carried with me wood of aloes , sandal , camphor , nutmegs , cloves , pepper , and ginger.
My family and I received one another with transports of sincere friendship.
I bought slaves and fine lands , and built me a great house.
And thus I settled myself , resolving to forget the miseries I had suffered , and to enjoy the pleasures of life"
by Indian Writer A poor blind person_0 and his wife were dependent on their son for their subsistence.
Every day the young fellow used to go out and get what he could by begging.
He begged her to be industrious , lest his parents should be angry and curse him.
Here he went and sat down by a merchant 's shop and asked alms.
Now at that time it happened that the king was seeking for a person_0 to look after a golden temple which he had just had built.
His Majesty was very glad , therefore , when he saw the person_0 and heard that he was good and honest.
Accordingly , on the following morning she went to the place and met her husband.
`` Why have you come here ?"
he asked.
`` Why have you left my parents ? Care you not whether they curse me and I die ? Go back immediately , and await my return"
`` No , no ,"
said the woman.
`` I can not go back to starve and see your old father and mother die.
There is not a grain of rice left in the house"
`` O Bhagawant !"
exclaimed the person_0.
`` Here , take this ,"
he continued , scribbling a few lines on some paper , and then handing it to her , `` and give it to the king.
You will see that he will give you a lac of rupees for it"
Thus saying he dismissed her , and the woman left.
Thirdly , If a man has to do any work , he must do it himself , and do it with might and without fear.
The king read the paper , and ordering the man to be flogged , dismissed him.
The prince asked her to show it to him , and when he had read it gave her a parwana for the amount , and rode on.
The poor person_0i was very thankful.
That day she laid in a great store of provisions , sufficient to last them all for a long time.
In the evening the prince related to his father the meeting with the woman , and the purchase of the piece of paper.
He thought his father would applaud the act.
But it was not so.
The king was more angry than before , and banished his son from the country.
So the prince bade adieu to his mother and relations and friends , and rode off on his horse , whither he did not know.
At nightfall he arrived at some place , where a man met him , and invited him to lodge at his house.
The prince accepted the invitation , and was treated like a prince.
Matting was spread for him to squat on , and the best provisions set before him.
`` Ah !"
thought he , as he lay down to rest , `` here is a case for the first piece of advice that the person_0i gave me.
I will not sleep to-night"
But he rose up and spoke.
`` Do not slay me ,"
he said.
`` What profit would you get from my death ? If you killed me you would be sorry afterwards , like that man who killed his dog"
`` What man ? What dog ?"
he asked.
`` I will tell you ,"
said the prince , `` if you will give me that sword"
He was suddenly reduced to poverty , and had to part with his dog.
He got a loan of five thousand rupees from a brother merchant , leaving the dog as a pledge , and with the money began business again.
Not long after this the other merchant 's shop was broken into by thieves and completely sacked.
There was hardly ten rupees ' worth left in the place.
`` In the morning there was great weeping and lamentation in the merchant 's house when it was known what had happened.
The merchant himself nearly went mad.
Meanwhile the dog kept on running to the door , and pulling at his master 's shirt and paijamas , as though wishing him to go outside.
The merchant consented , and went after the dog right up to the very place where the thieves had hidden the goods.
Here the animal scraped and barked , and showed in various ways that the things were underneath.
So the merchant and his friends dug about the place , and soon came upon all the stolen property.
Nothing was missing.
There was everything just as the thieves had taken them.
`` The merchant was very glad.
When this merchant saw his dog coming back again , he thought , ` Alas ! my friend is wanting the money.
How can I pay him ? I have not had sufficient time to recover myself from my recent losses.
I will slay the dog ere he reaches the threshold , and say that another must have slain it.
Thus there will be an end of my debt.
' `` No dog , no loan.
Accordingly he ran out and killed the poor dog , when the letter fell out of its collar.
The merchant picked it up and read it.
How great was his grief and disappointment when he knew the facts of the case ! `` Beware ,"
continued the prince , `` lest you do that which afterwards you would give your life not to have done"
By the time the prince had concluded this story it was nearly morning , and he went away , after rewarding the man.
The prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law.
He disguised himself as a jogi , and sitting down by a tree near the palace , pretended to be absorbed in worship.
News of the man and of his wonderful piety reached the ears of the king.
He felt interested in him , as his wife was very ill ; and he had sought for hakims to cure her , but in vain.
He thought that , perhaps , this holy man could do something for her.
So he sent to him.
Then the king took his wife and brought her to the jogi.
In the evening there was great consternation in the palace , because the queen had lost her pearl rosary , and nobody knew anything about it.
At length some one went to the jogi , and found it on the ground by the place where the queen had prostrated herself.
When the king heard this he was very angry , and ordered the jogi to be executed.
This stern order , however , was not carried out , as the prince bribed the men and escaped from the country.
But he knew that the second bit of advice was true.
Clad in his own clothes , the prince was walking along one day when he saw a potter crying and laughing alternately with his wife and children.
`` O fool ,"
said he , `` what is the matter ? If you laugh , why do you weep ? If you weep , why do you laugh ?"
`` Do not bother me ,"
said the potter.
`` What does it matter to you ?"
`` Pardon me ,"
said the prince , `` but I should like to know the reason"
`` The reason is this , then ,"
said the potter.
Nearly all the young men of the place have thus perished , and our son will be called on soon.
We laugh at the absurdity of the thing -- a potter 's son marrying a princess , and we cry at the terrible consequence of the marriage.
What can we do ?"
`` Truly a matter for laughing and weeping.
But weep no more ,"
said the prince.
`` I will exchange places with your son , and will be married to the princess instead of him.
Only give me suitable garments , and prepare me for the occasion"
So the potter gave him beautiful raiment and ornaments , and the prince went to the palace.
At night he was conducted to the apartment of the princess.
`` Dread hour !"
thought he ; `` am I to die like the scores of young men before me ?"
He clenched his sword with firm grip , and lay down on his bed , intending to keep awake all the night and see what would happen.
In the middle of the night he saw two Shahmars come out from the nostrils of the princess.
They stole over towards him , intending to kill him , like the others who had been before him : but he was ready for them.
He laid hold of his sword , and when the snakes reached his bed he struck at them and killed them.
In the morning the king came as usual to inquire , and was surprised to hear his daughter and the prince talking gaily together.
`` Surely ,"
said he , `` this man must be her husband , as he only can live with her"
`` Where do you come from ? Who are you ?"
asked the king , entering the room.
`` O king !"
replied the prince , `` I am the son of a king who rules over such-and-such a country"
When he heard this the king was very glad , and bade the prince to abide in his palace , and appointed him his successor to the throne.
The prince remained at the palace for more than a year , and then asked permission to visit his own country , which was granted.
On the way he had to pass through the country belonging to his brother - in-law , whom we have already mentioned.
Report of his arrival reached the ears of the king , who came with rope-tied hands and haltered neck to do him homage.
He most humbly begged him to stay at his palace , and to accept what little hospitality could be provided.
While the prince was staying at the palace he saw his sister , who greeted him with smiles and kisses.
Afterwards he went to his own home , and informed his mother and father of his arrival.
Alas ! his parents had both become blind from weeping about the loss of their son.
`` Let him come in ,"
said the king , `` and put his hands upon our eyes , and we shall see again"
So the prince entered , and was most affectionately greeted by his old parents ; and he laid his hands on their eyes , and they saw again.
Whereupon the king expressed his sorrow for having sent him away , and all was joy and peace again"
Many , many years ago there lived a good old man who had a wen like a tennis-ball growing out of his right cheek.
He tried everything he could think of.
He consulted many doctors far and near , and took all kinds of medicines both internally and externally.
But it was all of no use.
It was a fine day in the early autumn , and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry to get home.
So the whole afternoon passed quickly while he was chopping wood , and he had collected a goodly pile to take back to his wife.
When the day began to draw to a close , he turned his face homewards.
The old man had not gone far on his way down the mountain pass when the sky clouded and rain began to fall heavily.
He looked about for some shelter , but there was not even a charcoal-burner 's hut near.
At last he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree.
He thought that he must die of fright.
At last , however , the sky cleared , and the whole country was aglow in the rays of the setting sun.
But on looking out from the tree , what was his amazement to see , not his friends , but hundreds of demons coming towards the spot.
The more he looked , the greater was his astonishment.
All had horns growing on their foreheads.
The old man was so surprised at what he saw that he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree.
Fortunately for him the demons did not see him , as the tree was in the background.
So he picked himself up and crept back into the tree.
`` What are these creatures doing ?"
said the old man to himself.
`` I will look out , it sounds very amusing"
Food and wine was spread before them on the ground , and the demons were evidently having a great entertainment and enjoying themselves immensely.
It made the old man laugh to see their strange antics.
`` How amusing this is !"
laughed the old man to himself `` I am now quite old , but I have never seen anything so strange in all my life"
The demon chief was just taking a big cup of SAKE and watching one of the demons dancing.
In a little while he said with a bored air : `` Your dance is rather monotonous.
I am tired of watching it.
Is n't there any one amongst you all who can dance better than this fellow ?"
said the old fellow to himself.
His fears , however , were soon overcome by his love of dancing.
In a few minutes he could restrain himself no longer , and came out before the whole party of demons and began to dance at once.
`` How strange !"
exclaimed the horned chief.
`` I never saw such a skillful dancer before ! He dances admirably !"
When the old man had finished his dance , the big demon said : `` Thank you very much for your amusing dance.
Now give us the pleasure of drinking a cup of wine with us ,"
and with these words he handed him his largest wine-cup.
The old man thanked him very humbly : `` I did not expect such kindness from your lordship.
I fear I have only disturbed your pleasant party by my unskillful dancing"
`` No , no ,"
answered the big demon.
`` You must come often and dance for us.
Your skill has given us much pleasure"
The old man thanked him again and promised to do so.
`` Then will you come again to-morrow , old man ?"
asked the demon.
`` Certainly , I will ,"
answered the old man.
`` Then you must leave some pledge of your word with us ,"
said the demon.
`` Whatever you like ,"
said the old man.
`` Now what is the best thing he can leave with us as a pledge ?"
asked the demon , looking round.
I see the old man has a wen on his right cheek.
Now mortal men consider such a wen very fortunate.
Let my lord take the lump from the old man 's right cheek , and he will surely come to - morrow , if only to get that back"
`` You are very clever ,"
said the demon chief , giving his horns an approving nod.
Then he stretched out a hairy arm and claw-like hand , and took the great lump from the old man 's right cheek.
The old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened.
He hardly knew for some time where he was.
He put up his hand to feel if any scar remained , but found that his right cheek was as smooth as his left.
The sun had long set , and the young moon had risen like a silver crescent in the sky.
The old man suddenly realized how late it was and began to hurry home.
He patted his right cheek all the time , as if to make sure of his good fortune in having lost the wen.
He was so happy that he found it impossible to walk quietly -- he ran and danced the whole way home.
He found his wife very anxious , wondering what had happened to make him so late.
He soon told her all that had passed since he left home that afternoon.
Now next door to this good old couple there lived a wicked and disagreeable old man.
The good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to him.
Here he hid himself and waited for the twilight.
Just as he had been told , the band of demons came at that hour and held a feast with dance and song.
Why does n't he come ?"
`` Ah , you are the old man of yesterday ,"
said the demon chief.
`` Thank you for coming , you must dance for us soon"
The old man now stood up and opened his fan and began to dance.
But he had never learned to dance , and knew nothing about the necessary gestures and different positions.
The Oni were very dissatisfied at this exhibition , and said amongst themselves : `` How badly he dances to-day !"
Then to the old man the demon chief said : `` Your performance to-day is quite different from the dance of yesterday.
We do n't wish to see any more of such dancing.
We will give you back the pledge you left with us.
You must go away at once"
The lump immediately attached itself to his cheek as firmly as if it had grown there always , and all attempts to pull it off were useless.
He put up first one hand and then the other to each side of his face to make sure if he were not dreaming a horrible nightmare.
No , sure enough there was now a great wen on the right side of his face as on the left.
The demons had all disappeared , and there was nothing for him to do but to return home.
He was a pitiful sight , for his face , with the two large lumps , one on each side , looked just like a Japanese gourd"
_ This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about a Brother who had ceased striving after righteousness.
Said the Teacher to him : `` Is it really true that you have ceased all striving ?"
-- `` Yes , Blessed One ,"
he replied.
And he told a story of long ago.
_ Once upon a time , when Brahmadatta was King of Benares , the person_0 was born as son of his chief queen.
On his name-day they asked 800 Brahmans , having satisfied them with all their desires , about his lucky marks.
`` Who shall be my teacher ?"
the lad asked.
Take this , and give it him for a fee"
With that he gave him a thousand pieces of money , and dismissed him.
On his way he came to a forest inhabited by the person_1 with the Matted Hair.
And they tried to stop him.
But the person_0 , having confidence in himself , went straight on , fearless as a maned lion.
When he reached mid-forest the person_1 showed himself.
`` Where are you going ?"
he shouted.
`` Stop ! You 'll make a meal for me !"
Said the person_0 : `` person_1 , I came here trusting in myself.
I advise you to be careful how you come near me.
Here 's a poisoned arrow , which I 'll shoot at you and knock you down !"
With this menace , he fitted to his bow an arrow dipped in deadly poison , and let fly.
The arrow stuck fast in the person_1 's hair.
Then he shot and shot , till he had shot away fifty arrows ; and they all stuck in the person_1 's hair.
`` You , person_1 !"
This day will I pound you and grind you to powder !"
Thus did he declare his resolve , and with a shout he hit at the person_1 with his right hand.
and his head stuck fast like the rest.
Thus the person_0 was five times snared , caught fast in five places , hanging suspended : yet he felt no fear -- was not even nervous.
Since I have ravaged this road , I never saw such a man.
Now , why is it that he does not fear ?"
He was powerless to eat the man , but asked him : `` Why is it , young sir , that you are not frightened to death ?"
`` Why should I fear , person_1 ?"
replied he.
`` In one life a man can die but once.
That is why I fear nothing"
-LRB- By this , the person_0 meant the weapon of knowledge which he had within him.
-RRB- When he heard this , the person_1 thought : `` This young man speaks the truth.
I 'll let him go !"
I set you free from my hands , as the moon is disgorged from the jaws of Rahu after the eclipse.
Go back to the company of your friends and relations !"
And the person_0 said : `` person_1 , I will go , as you say.
You were born a person_1 , cruel , blood-bibbing , devourer of the flesh and gore of others , because you did wickedly in former lives.
If you still go on doing wickedly , you will go from darkness to darkness.
But now that you have seen me you will find it impossible to do wickedly.
At the entrance of the forest he told all to the people thereabout ; and went on to Benares , armed with his five weapons.
Afterwards he became king , and ruled righteously ; and after giving alms and doing good he passed away according to his deeds.
Thus the Teacher reached the summit , through sainthood and the teaching of the law , and thereupon he declared the Four Truths.
At the end of the declaring of the Truths , this Brother also attained to sainthood.
_"
THERE were once two brothers who both served as soldiers ; one of them was rich , and the other poor.
Then the poor one , to escape from his poverty , put off his soldier 's coat , and turned farmer.
He dug and hoed his bit of land , and sowed it with turnip-seed.
So he placed it on a cart , harnessed two oxen , took it to the palace , and presented it to the King.
`` What strange thing is this ?"
said the King.
`` Ah , no !"
said the farmer , `` no luck-child am I.
I am a poor soldier , who because he could no longer support himself hung his soldier 's coat on a nail and took to farming land.
I have a brother who is rich and well known to you , Lord King , but I , because I have nothing , am forgotten by every one"
So the rich man was obliged to put his brother 's turnip in a cart and have it taken to his home.
The other agreed to this , and accompanied him without suspicion.
While they were on their way , however , the murderers fell on him , bound him , and would have hanged him to a tree.
But just as they were doing this , loud singing and the sound of a horse 's feet were heard in the distance.
He , however , worked up there until he had made a hole in the sack through which he could put his head.
When he who was aloft saw that someone was passing below him , he cried , `` Good day ! You have come at a lucky time"
The student looked round on every side , but did not know whence the voice came.
At last he said , `` Who calls me ?"
Then an answer came from the top of the tree , `` Raise your eyes ; here I sit aloft in the Sack of Wisdom.
If you were once within it you would feel what noble things issue forth from the Sack of Knowledge"
So the student let the sack down , untied it , and set him free , and then cried , `` Now draw me up at once ,"
and was about to get into the sack.
`` Halt !"
said the other , `` that wo n't do ,"
Keep perfectly quiet until thou becomest wiser"
Thereupon he mounted the student 's horse and rode away , but in an hour 's time sent some one to let the student out again"
This said , she with the friend was quickly laid , Without suspecting what mistake she 'd made.
I 've many seen , but such a charming fair , There 's not another like her any where.
The host was struck with what the spark averred , And muttered something indistinctly heard.
The hostess now , on ev ` ry side perceived Her peril great , and for the error grieved.
Upon the road oft finding , where he stayed , Delightful wines , and handsome belle or maid , With careless ease he loitered up and down.
He most gallantly saw her safely home ; Attentions charm the sex where'er we roam.
To rouse his wrath the story quite sufficed ; The spouse resolved to do as she advised.
Howe'er to dupe him was an easy lot ; The hour arrived , his dress he soon had got , Away he ran with anxious fond delight.
In hopes the wily spark to trap that night.
Protect me Heav ` n ! poor sinner that I 'm here ! To guard thy honor I will persevere.
I 'd have him take within our town a wife , And you and I 'll regard him during life.
In that , replied the lady , we agree , And heartily thereto I pledged will be"
Your looks sufficiently the fact proclaim , For many instances I 've known the same.
Now let us see , without more talk or fears , If I know how to forge the bantling ears.
Remember , cried the wife , to make them like.
Leave that to me , said he , I 'll justly strike.
I 'm much obliged to you , the wife replied , A friend is good in whom we may confide.
Said he , all other things aside I 've laid , This ear to finish , and to lend you aid.
THE ear howe'er was still in hand the same , When from his journey home the husband came.
Enraged at length , a pistol by the bed He seized and swore at once he 'd shoot her dead.
The belle with tears replied , howe'er she 'd swerved , Such cruel treatment never she deserved.
Her innocence , and simple , gentle way , At length appeared his frantick rage to lay.
Poor innocent ! the point she nicely hit ; Fear oft gives simpletons a sort of wit.
Go , bring her instantly , haste quickly , run ; And , if she comes , I 'll pardon what 's been done.
When I was absent from my loving dear , Obligingly he made her babe an ear.
THE change of food enjoyment is to man ; In this , t ` include the woman is my plan.
Each looker-on conceives , LOVE needs not greet Such humble wights , as he would prelates treat.
The project was most thoroughly approved ; Like inclination both the husbands moved.
ANTOINETTA , said the second spouse , Has neither ill nor scratch her fears to rouse.
I was not present , fully I admit ; But rarely clergymen their dues will quit.
The very clerk would not remit his fee : -- All those who serve the church in this agree.
Let 's take her back , and play the Norman trick Deny the whole , and by our priv ` lege stick.
IMMEDIATELY he ev ` ry effort tried , To get the bargain fully set aside.
Giles , much distressed , exerted all his might , To keep his prize , and prove his conduct right.
The cause was carried to the bishop 's court ; Much noise it made , according to report.
At length the parliament would hear the claim , And judge a case of such peculiar fame.
I much regret my lot was not the same , Though doubtless many will my wishes blame"
`` It was in a little provincial town ,"
the Moon said ; `` it certainly happened last year , but that has nothing to do with the matter.
I saw it quite plainly.
To-day I read about it in the papers , but there it was not half so clearly expressed.
I saw it all ,"
said the Moon.
` This must be a great dog , ' they said , and began to stroke him.
It was a charming sight to behold.
Each boy now took his gun , and the bear was obliged to have one too , and he held it up quite properly.
Here was a capital playmate they had found ; and they began marching -- one , two ; one , two.
`` Suddenly some one came to the door , which opened , and the mother of the children appeared.
But the youngest boy nodded to her in great glee , and called out in his infantile prattle , ` We 're playing at soldiers.
' And then the bear leader came running up"
`` I knew an old maid ,"
said the Moon.
`` Every winter she wore a wrapper of yellow satin , and it always remained new , and was the only fashion she followed.
In summer she always wore the same straw hat , and I verily believe the very same grey-blue dress.
During the last months I saw her no more at the window , but she was still alive.
I knew that , for I had not yet seen her begin the ` long journey , ' of which she often spoke with her friend.
Our family vault is six miles from here.
I shall be carried there , and shall sleep there among my family and relatives.
' Last night a van stopped at the house.
A coffin was carried out , and then I knew that she was dead.
They placed straw round the coffin , and the van drove away.
There slept the quiet old lady , who had not gone out of her house once for the last year.
The van rolled out through the town-gate as briskly as if it were going for a pleasant excursion.
On the high-road the pace was quicker yet.
A hare jumped across the road and startled them , and they fairly ran away.
The lark rose up again , singing gaily , and I withdrew behind the red morning clouds"
Long , long ago there lived in Kyoto a brave soldier named Kintoki.
Now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her.
Not long after this , through the malice of some of his friends , he fell into disgrace at Court and was dismissed.
She called him person_0 or the Golden Boy.
Then his mother gave him a large ax , and he used to go out in the forest and help the woodcutters , who called him `` Wonder-child ,"
and his mother the `` Old Nurse of the Mountains ,"
for they did not know her high rank.
Another favorite pastime of person_0 's was to smash up rocks and stones.
By degrees they all grew quite tame and looked upon person_0 as their master , and he used them as his servants and messengers.
But his special retainers were the bear , the deer , the monkey and the hare.
Great was the fun they all had together.
One day , as usual , person_0 went up into the mountains , followed by the bear , the deer , the monkey , and the hare.
Here , indeed , was a nice place where they could all have a good romp together.
person_0 said , `` Here is a place for a good game.
What do you all say to a wrestling match ?"
The bear being the biggest and the oldest , answered for the others : `` That will be great fun ,"
said she.
`` I am the strongest animal , so I will make the platform for the wrestlers ;"
and she set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape.
`` All right ,"
said person_0 , `` I will look on while you all wrestle with each other.
I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round"
`` What fun ! we shall all try to get the prize ,"
said the bear.
The deer , the monkey and the hare set to work to help the bear raise the platform on which they were all to wrestle.
Now , Mr.
Deer , you are to be umpire !"
`` He , he !"
answered the deer.
`` I will be umpire.
Now , Mr.
Monkey and Mr.
Hare , if you are both ready , please walk out and take your places on the platform"
Then the monkey and the hare both hopped out , quickly and nimbly , to the wrestling platform.
The deer , as umpire , stood between the two and called out : `` Red-back ! Red-back !"
-LRB- this to the monkey , who has a red back in Japan -RRB-.
`` Are you ready ?"
Then he turned to the hare : `` Long-ears ! Long-ears ! are you ready ?"
Both the little wrestlers faced each other while the deer raised a leaf on high as signal.
When he dropped the leaf the monkey and the hare rushed upon each other , crying `` Yoisho , yoisho !"
`` Red-back ! Red-back ! stand your ground !"
called out the deer.
`` Long-ears ! Long-ears ! be strong , be strong -- do n't let the monkey beat you !"
grunted the bear.
So the monkey and the hare , encouraged by their friends , tried their very hardest to beat each other.
The hare at last gained on the monkey.
The monkey seemed to trip up , and the hare giving him a good push sent him flying off the platform with a bound.
The poor monkey sat up rubbing his back , and his face was very long as he screamed angrily.
`` Oh , oh ! how my back hurts -- my back hurts me !"
Seeing the monkey in this plight on the ground , the deer holding his leaf on high said : `` This round is finished -- the hare has won"
Now the monkey got up looking very cross , and as they say in Japan `` his stomach stood up ,"
for he felt that he had not been fairly beaten.
So he said to person_0 and the others who were standing by : `` I have not been fairly beaten.
My foot slipped and I tumbled.
Please give me another chance and let the hare wrestle with me for another round"
Then person_0 consenting , the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again.
To do this , he thought that the best and surest way would be to get hold of the hare 's long ear.
This he soon managed to do.
The monkey was now the victor and received , a rice-dumpling from person_0 , which pleased him so much that he quite forgot his sore back.
The bear came forward as umpire.
The deer with long horns and the hare with long ears , it must have been an amusing sight to those who watched this queer match.
Suddenly the deer went down on one of his knees , and the bear with the leaf on high declared him beaten.
In this way , sometimes the one , sometimes the other , conquering , the little party amused themselves till they were tired.
At last person_0 got up and said : `` This is enough for to-day.
What a nice place we have found for wrestling ; let us come again to-morrow.
Now , we will all go home.
Come along !"
So saying , person_0 led the way while the animals followed.
After walking some little distance they came out on the banks of a river flowing through a valley.
person_0 and his four furry friends stood and looked about for some means of crossing.
Bridge there was none.
The river rushed `` don , don"
on its way.
All the animals looked serious , wondering how they could cross the stream and get home that evening.
person_0 , however , said : `` Wait a moment.
I will make a good bridge for you all in a few minutes"
The bear , the deer , the monkey and the hare looked at him to see what he would do now.
person_0 went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank.
At last he stopped in front of a very large tree that was growing at the water 's edge.
-LRB- crash , crash -RRB- , over fell the tree , forming an excellent bridge across the stream.
`` There ,"
said person_0 , `` what do you think of my bridge ? It is quite safe , so follow me ,"
and he stepped across first.
The four animals followed.
Never had they seen any one so strong before , and they all exclaimed : `` How strong he is ! how strong he is !"
He watched with great surprise person_0 and his animal companions.
Whose son can he be ? I will find out before this day is done"
He hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them.
person_0 knew nothing of all this , and little guessed that he was being followed.
`` O , Kimbo !"
said his mother with a bright smile , glad to see her boy home safe after the long day.
`` How late you are to-day.
I feared that something had happened to you.
Where have you been all the time ?"
We all enjoyed the sport , and are going to the same place to-morrow to have another match"
`` Now tell me who is the strongest of all ?"
asked his mother , pretending not to know.
`` Oh , mother ,"
said person_0 , `` do n't you know that I am the strongest ? There was no need for me to wrestle with any of them"
`` But next to you then , who is the strongest ?"
`` The bear comes next to me in strength ,"
answered person_0.
`` And after the bear ?"
asked his mother again.
said person_0.
Suddenly person_0 and his mother were startled by a voice from outside.
`` Listen to me , little boy ! Next time you go , take this old man with you to the wrestling match.
He would like to join the sport too !"
It was the old woodcutter who had followed person_0 from the river.
He slipped off his clogs and entered the cottage.
Yama-uba and her son were both taken by surprise.
They looked at the intruder wonderingly and saw that he was some one they had never seen before.
`` Who are you ?"
they both exclaimed.
Then person_0 and the woodcutter both put out their right arms and grasped each other 's hands.
At last the old man desisted , declaring it a drawn game.
`` You are , indeed , a very strong child.
There are few men who can boast of the strength of my right arm !"
said the woodcutter.
Hardly able to believe what I saw I followed you home.
Your strength of arm , which I have just tried , proves what I saw this afternoon.
When you are full-grown you will surely be the strongest man in all Japan.
It is a pity that you are hidden away in these wild mountains"
`` You are very kind to take so much interest in my son"
`` You need not trouble yourself about that.
To tell you the truth I am no woodcutter ! I am one of the great generals of Japan.
My name is Sadamitsu , and I am a vassal of the powerful Lord Minamoto-no - Raiko.
I thought that I could best do this by assuming the disguise of a woodcutter.
By good fortune , I have thus unexpectedly come across your son.
What do you say to this ?"
As the kind general gradually unfolded his plan the mother 's heart was filled with a great joy.
She saw that here was a wonderful chance of the one wish of her life being fulfilled -- that of seeing person_0 a SAMURAI before she died.
Bowing her head to the ground , she replied : `` I will then intrust my son to you if you really mean what you say"
person_0 had all this time been sitting by his mother 's side listening to what they said.
Long , long ago.
when all the animals could talk , there lived in the province of person_1 in Japan , a little white hare.
His home was on the island of Oki , and just across the sea was the mainland of person_1.
Now the hare wanted very much to cross over to person_1.
Day after day he would go out and sit on the shore and look longingly over the water in the direction of person_1.
and day after day he hoped to find some way of getting across.
`` This is very lucky !"
thought the hare.
`` Now I shall be able to get my wish.
I will ask the crocodile to carry me across the sea !"
But he was doubtful whether the crocodile would consent to do what wanted.
So he thought instead of asking a favor he would try to get what he wanted by a trick.
So with a loud voice he called to the crocodile , and said : `` Oh , Mr.
Crocodile , is n't it a lovely day ?"
The crocodile swam nearer the shore , very pleased to hear some one speak.
`` I wonder who it was that spoke to me just now ! Was it you , Mr.
Hare ? You must be very lonely all by yourself !"
`` Oh , no , I am not at all lonely ,"
said the hare , `` but as it was such a fine day I came out here to enjoy myself.
Wo n't you stop and play with me a little while ?"
The crocodile came out of the sea and sat on the shore , and the two played together for some time.
Then the hare said : `` Mr.
Tell me , do you think the number of your company is greater than mine ?"
`` Of course , there are more crocodiles than hares ,"
answered the crocodile.
The crocodile was very conceited.
The crocodile thought for a moment and then answered : `` Of course , it is possible"
`` Then do try ,"
said the artful hare , `` and I will count the number from here !"
The crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time.
The hare , meanwhile , waited patiently on the shore.
At last the crocodile appeared , bringing with him a large number of other crocodiles.
`` Look , Mr.
Hare !"
said the crocodile , `` it is nothing for my friends to form a line between here and person_1.
There are enough crocodiles to stretch from here even as far as China or India.
Did you ever see so many crocodiles ?"
Then the whole company of crocodiles arranged themselves in the water so as to form a bridge between the Island of Oki and the mainland of person_1.
When the hare saw the bridge of crocodiles , he said : `` How splendid ! I did not believe this was possible.
One , two , three , four , five , six.
seven , eight , nine --"
Thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of person_1.
And he was just about to run away as fast as he could.
So some of them ran after the hare and caught him.
Then they all surrounded the poop little animal and pulled out all his fur.
He cried out loudly and entreated them to spare him , but with each tuft of fur they pulled out they said : `` Serve you right !"
He could hardly move , and all he could do was to lie on the beach quite helpless and weep over the misfortune that had befallen him.
Now one of these young men had a bad and spiteful disposition.
But he feigned kindness , and said to the hare : `` I feel very sorry for you.
If you will only try it , I know of a remedy which will cure your sore body.
Go and bathe yourself in the sea , and then come and sit in the wind.
This will make your fur grow again , and you will be just as you were before"
Then all the young men passed on.
The hare was very pleased , thinking that he had found a cure.
He went and bathed in the sea and then came out and sat where the wind could blow upon him.
Just then another King 's son passed by , carrying a great bag on his back.
He saw the hare , and stopped and asked why he was crying so loudly.
Who can have treated you so cruelly ?"
`` I know ,"
`` Then I will tell you of a good remedy ,"
said the man.
`` First go and bathe well in that pond over there and try to wash all the salt from your body.
Then pick some of those kaba flowers that are growing near the edge of the water , spread them on the ground and roll yourself on them.
If you do this the pollen will cause your fur to grow again , and you will be quite well in a little while"
The hare was very glad to be told what to do , so kindly.
Please tell me who you are ?"
`` I am no King 's son as you think me.
I am a fairy , and my name is Okuni-nushi-no-person_0 ,"
answered the man , `` and those beings who passed here before me are my brothers.
But on this expedition I am only an attendant , so I am walking behind them with this great big bag on my back"
The hare humbled himself before this great fairy Okuni-nushi-no - person_0 , whom many in that part of the land worshiped as a god.
`` Oh , I did not know that you were Okuni-nushi-no-person_0.
I am quite sure that you will win her heart without intending to do so , and she will ask to be your bride"
Okuni-nushi-no-person_0 took no notice of what the hare said , but bidding the little animal goodby , went on his way quickly and soon overtook his brothers.
He found them just entering the Princess 's gate.
and so they were married.
This is the end of the story.
Okuni-nushi-no-person_0 is worshiped by the people in some parts of Japan , as a god , and the hare has become famous as `` The White Hare of person_1"
But what became of the crocodiles nobody knows"
And after the person_0 had promised her this she closed her eyes and died.
For a long time the person_0 could not be comforted , and had no thought of taking another wife.
At length his councillors said , `` There is no help for it , the person_0 must marry again , that we may have a Queen"
And now messengers were sent about far and wide , to seek a bride who equalled the late Queen in beauty.
So the messengers came home as they went.
Now the person_0 had a daughter , who was just as beautiful as her dead mother , and had the same golden hair.
The daughter was still more shocked when she became aware of her father 's resolution , but hoped to turn him from his design.
But she thought , `` To get that will be quite impossible , and thus I shall divert my father from his wicked intentions"
Then she commended herself to God , and went away , and walked the whole night until she reached a great forest.
And as she was tired , she got into a hollow tree , and fell asleep.
The sun rose , and she slept on , and she was still sleeping when it was full day.
Then it so happened that the person_0 to whom this forest belonged , was hunting in it.
When his dogs came to the tree , they sniffed , and ran barking round about it.
The person_0 said to the huntsmen , `` Just see what kind of wild beast has hidden itself in there"
Its skin is fur of a thousand different kinds , but it is lying asleep"
Said the person_0 , `` See if you can catch it alive , and then fasten it to the carriage , and we will take it with us"
Then said they , `` Allerleirauh , thou wilt be useful in the kitchen , come with us , and thou canst sweep up the ashes"
So they put her in the carriage , and took her home to the royal palace.
Allerleirauh lived there for a long time in great wretchedness.
The cook answered , `` Yes , go , but you must be back here in half-an-hour to sweep the hearth"
When the dance was over she curtsied , and when the person_0 looked round again she had vanished , and none knew whither.
The guards who stood outside the palace were called and questioned , but no one had seen her.
Then he ordered the cook to appear before him.
When he came before the person_0 the latter asked who had made the soup ? The cook replied , `` I made it"
But the person_0 said , `` That is not true , for it was much better than usual , and cooked differently"
He answered , `` I must acknowledge that I did not make it , it was made by the rough animal"
The person_0 said , `` Go and bid it come up here"
When Allerleirauh came , the person_0 said , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am a poor girl who no longer has any father or mother"
He asked further , `` Of what use art thou in my palace ?"
She answered , `` I am good for nothing but to have boots thrown at my head"
He continued , `` Where didst thou get the ring which was in the soup ?"
She answered , `` I know nothing about the ring"
So the person_0 could learn nothing , and had to send her away again.
After a while , there was another festival , and then , as before , Allerleirauh begged the cook for leave to go and look on.
He answered , `` Yes , but come back again in half-an-hour , and make the person_0 the bread soup which he so much likes"
But when it was ended , she again disappeared so quickly that the person_0 could not observe where she went.
When the cook had gone up-stairs , she fetched the little golden spinning-wheel , and put it in the bowl so that the soup covered it.
When , for the third time , the person_0 held a festival , all happened just as it had done before.
but as she begged so hard , he let her go up at the appointed time.
And now she put on the dress which shone like the stars , and thus entered the hall.
Again the person_0 danced with the beautiful maiden , and thought that she never yet had been so beautiful.
The person_0 clutched the mantle and tore it off.
Then her golden hair shone forth , and she stood there in full splendor , and could no longer hide herself.
And when she had washed the soot and ashes from her face , she was more beautiful than anyone who had ever been seen on earth.
But the person_0 said , `` Thou art my dear bride , and we will never more part from each other"
Thereupon the marriage was solemnized , and they lived happily until their death"
Long , long ago there was a large plain called Adachigahara , in the province of Mutsu in Japan.
This place was said to be haunted by a cannibal goblin who took the form of an old woman.
One day as the sun was setting , a priest came to the plain.
He found himself lost in the midst of the large plain , and looked about in vain for some sign of human habitation.
He exclaimed with joy : `` Oh.
surely that is some cottage where I can get a night 's lodging !"
The hut was open , and by the light of an old lantern an old woman sat industriously spinning.
I beg you to be good enough to let me spend the night under your roof"
The old woman as soon as she heard herself spoken to stopped spinning , rose from her seat and approached the intruder.
`` I am very sorry for you.
You must indeed be distressed to have lost your way in such a lonely spot so late at night.
Unfortunately I can not put you up , for I have no bed to offer you , and no accommodation whatsoever for a guest in this poor place !"
`` Oh , that does not matter ,"
I am too tired to walk further to-night , so I hope you will not refuse me , otherwise I shall have to sleep out on the cold plain"
And in this way he pressed the old woman to let him stay.
She seemed very reluctant , but at last she said : `` Very well , I will let you stay here.
I can offer you a very poor welcome only , but come in now and I will make a fire , for the night is cold"
The pilgrim was only too glad to do as he was told.
He took off his sandals and entered the hut.
The old woman then brought some sticks of wood and lit the fire , and bade her guest draw near and warm himself.
`` You must be hungry after your long tramp ,"
said the old woman.
`` I will go and cook some supper for you"
She then went to the kitchen to cook some rice.
After the priest had finished his supper the old woman sat down by the fire-place , and they talked together for a long time.
The pilgrim thought to himself that he had been very lucky to come across such a kind , hospitable old woman.
`` I see you are cold ,"
said the old woman ; `` I will go out and gather some wood , for we have used it all.
You must stay and take care of the house while I am gone"
`` No , no ,"
The old woman shook her head and said : `` You must stay quietly here , for you are my guest"
Then she left him and went out.
Now mind what I tell you !"
`` If you tell me not to go near the back room , of course I wo n't ,"
said the priest , rather bewildered.
The old woman then went out again , and the priest was left alone.
The fire had died out , and the only light in the hut was that of a dim lantern.
aroused his curiosity and his fear.
He got up and began to move slowly towards the back room.
Then the thought that the old woman would be very angry with him if he disobeyed her made him come back to his place by the fireside.
He must find out.
`` She will not know that I have looked unless I tell her.
I will just have a peep before she comes back ,"
said the man to himself.
With trembling hands he pushed back the sliding door and looked in.
What he saw froze the blood in his veins.
The room was full of dead men 's bones and the walls were splashed and the floor was covered with human blood.
In one corner skull upon skull rose to the ceiling , in another was a heap of arm bones , in another a heap of leg bones.
The sickening smell made him faint.
He fell backwards with horror , and for some time lay in a heap with fright on the floor , a pitiful sight.
He trembled all over and his teeth chattered , and he could hardly crawl away from the dreadful spot.
`` How horrible !"
he cried out.
`` What awful den have I come to in my travels ? May Buddha help me or I am lost.
Out into the night he ran , his one thought to get as far as he could from the goblin 's haunt.
He had not gone far when he heard steps behind him and a voice crying : `` Stop ! stop !"
He ran on , redoubling his speed , pretending not to hear.
`` Stop ! stop , you wicked man , why did you look into the forbidden room ?"
The priest quite forgot how tired he was and his feet flew over the ground faster than ever.
Fear gave him strength , for he knew that if the goblin caught him he would soon be one of her victims.
With all his heart he repeated the prayer to Buddha : `` Namu Amida Butsu , Namu Amida Butsu"
And after him rushed the dreadful old hag , her hair flying in the wind , and her face changing with rage into the demon that she was.
In her hand she carried a large blood-stained knife , and she still shrieked after him , `` Stop ! stop !"
The priest now knew that he had met the Goblin of Adachigahara , the story of whom he had often heard but never believed to be true.
He then set forward for another part of the country , only too glad to leave the haunted plain behind him"
Now in a certain place there lived a person_0 named Haridatta.
He was a farmer , but poor was the return his labor brought him.
Suddenly he saw a great hooded snake creeping out of an ant-hill near at hand.
So he thought to himself , `` Sure this is the guardian deity of the field , and I have not ever worshipped it.
That 's why my farming is in vain.
I will at once go and pay my respects to it"
That is why I have not yet paid my respects to you ; pray forgive me"
And he laid the milk down and went to his house.
One day the person_0 had to go to the village , and so he ordered his son to take the milk to the ant-hill.
The son brought the milk , put it down , and went back home.
So next day , while he was giving the milk to the serpent , the person_0 's son struck it on the head with a cudgel.
His people raised him a funeral pyre not far from the field and burnt him to ashes.
Two days afterwards his father came back , and when he learned his son 's fate he grieved and mourned.
But after a time , he took the bowl of milk , went to the ant-hill , and praised the serpent with a loud voice.
After a long , long time the serpent appeared , but only with its head out of the opening of the ant-hill , and spoke to the person_0 :"
` Tis greed that brings you here , and makes you even forget the loss of your son.
From this time forward friendship between us is impossible.
Your son struck me in youthful ignorance , and I have bitten him to death.
How can I forget the blow with the cudgel ? And how can you forget the pain and grief at the loss of your son ?"
So speaking , it gave the person_0 a costly pearl and disappeared.
But before it went away it said : `` Come back no more"
The person_0 took the pearl , and went back home , cursing the folly of his son"
THE worst of ills , with jealousy compared , Are trifling torments ev ` ry where declared.
Be warned by others ' ills ; the tale I 'll tell ; Perhaps your irksomeness it may dispel.
YES , yes , but honor has , you know , a claim : Who e ` er denied it ? -- never 'twas my aim.
Were this misfortune viewed with proper eyes , Such ills from cuckoldom would ne'er arise.
Whence this conclusion must directly spring : To be a cuckold is a useful thing.
These reasons make me to my thesis cling , -- To be a cuckold is a useful thing.
From convents , heiresses are often led Directly to the altar to be wed.
.
SOME time the father had the girl declared His lawful child , who all his fondness shared.
Her fortune ample was ; the dow ` r the same ; The belle an only child ; the like her flame.
But better still , our couple 's chief delight , Was mutual love and pleasure to excite.
WHAT should a husband do whose wife is sought , With anxious fondness by another ? Naught.
` Tis this that leads me ever to advise , To sleep at ease whichever side he lies.
WHERE ` ER suspicion dwells you may be sure , To cuckoldom ` twill prove a place secure.
But person_0 -LRB- such the husband 's name -RRB- , ` tis clear , Thought otherwise , as we shall make appear.
Like person_0 , husbands nowhere now are found , And I 'm not certain , such were e ` er on ground.
Our swain his marriage vow to this opposed ; At which th ' enchantress much surprise disclosed.
Domestick joys should be to cits confined ; For none but such were scenes like those designed.
Come make the trial : you 'll Calista find , Quite new again when to her arms resigned.
But let me tell you , though your wife be chaste , Erastus to your mansion oft is traced.
CALISTA saw the flatt ` ring lover 's scheme ; And turned to ridicule the wily theme.
But still I love thee , spite of evil thought ; My death will pay the ills thou ` st on me brought.
But should , from out his brow , no horns yet pop -- He drinks the whole , nor spills a single drop.
Thus person_0 spoke , and to his precious wife A curious sermon preached , it seems , on life.
She turned coquette ; restraints the FAIR awake , And only prompt more liberties to take.
FOUR times an hour his lips to sip he placed ; And clearly , for a week was not disgraced.
AT length , the wife a lucky moment sought , When person_0 seemed by soft caresses caught.
The portion spilled by each from out the vase Was taken for the length , and fixed the place.
LET Reynold 's conduct , husbands , be your line ; Who person_0 's follows surely will repine.
Perhaps the first should have been made the chief ; Though , doubtless , that is matter of belief.
Let the wind speak , for he knows plenty of stories and fairy tales , many more than are known to any of us.
Just hear what the wind can tell.
Huh -- uh -- ush ! roar along ! That is the burden of the song.
says the person_0.
`` I know every stone in it ; I saw it when it still belonged to the castle of Marsk Stig on the promontory.
How proudly he carried himself -- he was of royal blood ! He could do more than merely hunt the stag and empty the wine-can.
` It _ shall _ be done , ' he was accustomed to say.
`` His wife walked proudly in gold-embroidered garments over the polished marble floors.
The tapestries were gorgeous , the furniture was expensive and artistically carved.
She had brought gold and silver plate with her into the house , and there was German beer in the cellar.
Black fiery horses neighed in the stables.
There was a wealthy look about the house of Borreby at that time , when wealth was still at home there.
`` Four children dwelt there also ; three delicate maidens , Ida , Joanna , and Anna Dorothea : I have never forgotten their names.
`` They were rich people , noble people , born in affluence , nurtured in affluence.
`` Huh -- sh ! roar along !"
said the person_0.
`` Ostentation , and haughtiness , and splendor , and display , and rule were there , but the fear of the Lord was not there.
`` And it was just on the evening of the first day of May ,"
the person_0 continued.
`` I lay quite quiet ,"
`` And the noble lady drove towards the baronial mansion , with her three daughters , in a gilded carriage drawn by six horses.
The daughters were young and fair -- three charming blossoms , rose , lily , and pale hyacinth.
Huh -- sh ! hurry along ! hurry along ! `` Yes , the carriage rolled on with them , and the peasant people resumed their dancing.
They rode that summer through all the villages round about.
But in the night , when I rose again ,"
`` Waldemar Daa stood for a space silent and thoughtful.
` The proudest tree can be bowed without being broken , ' said a voice within him.
said the person_0.
It was still spring ; some of them were yet sitting on their eggs , others had already hatched their young.
But how they flew up , how they cried ! The axe sounded , blow on blow : the wood was to be felled.
Crows and ravens croaked aloud as if in scorn.
Therefore the tree with the black stork 's nest was left standing.
The tree was not worth speaking of.
`` There was a great hewing and sawing , and a three-decker was built.
`` The proud black horses were neighing in the stable ; they were worth looking at , and accordingly they _ were _ looked at.
`` I heard all that ,"
said the person_0.
`` I accompanied the gentlemen through the open door , and strewed blades of straw like bars of gold before their feet.
`` I made the snow-flakes whirl , and the snow lay like a great lake high around the ship , and drifted over it.
I let it hear my voice , that it might know what a storm has to say.
Certainly I did my part towards teaching it seamanship.
`` Her sister was bright and slender as a lily.
Joanna had height and deportment , but was like her mother , rather stiff in the stalk.
She was very fond of walking through the great hall , where hung the portraits of her ancestors.
The women were painted in dresses of silk and velvet , with a tiny little hat , embroidered with pearls , on their plaited hair.
They were handsome women.
I heard it , as I swept into the long hall , and turned round to come out again.
Waldemar Daa was arrogant and proud , but he was also a learned man , and knew a great deal.
That was no secret , and many opinions were expressed concerning it.
In his chimney there was fire even in summer time.
`` That is why the chimney was always smoking , therefore the flames crackled so frequently.
Yes , I was there too ,"
said the person_0.
`` Empty grew the barns and store-rooms , the cellars and magazines.
The servants decreased in number , and the mice multiplied.
Then a window broke , and then another , and I could get in elsewhere besides at the door ,"
said the person_0"
` Where the chimney smokes the meal is being cooked , ' the proverb says.
But here the chimney smoked that devoured all the meals , for the sake of the red gold.
`` I blew through the courtyard-gate like a watchman blowing his horn ,"
the person_0 went on , `` but no watchman was there.
`` I blew the smoke and ashes into his face and beard : the result of his labor was debt instead of pelf.
I sung through the burst window-panes and the yawning clefts in the walls.
That was not the song that had been sung at the children 's cradle.
The lordly life had changed to a life of penury.
I was the only one who rejoiced aloud in that castle ,"
said the person_0.
`` I snowed them up , and they say snow keeps people warm.
They had no wood , and the forest from which they might have brought it was cut down.
It was a biting frost.
I rushed in through loopholes and passages , over gables and roofs , that I might be brisk.
They were lying in bed because of the cold , the three high-born daughters ; and their father was crouching under his leathern coverlet.
` After winter comes spring , ' he said.
At Easter ! ' `` I heard how he spoke thus , looking at a spider 's web.
` Thou cunning little weaver , thou dost teach me perseverance.
Let them tear thy web , and thou wilt begin it again , and complete it.
' `` It was the morning of Easter-day.
The bells sounded from the neighbouring church , and the sun seemed to rejoice in the sky.
The master had watched through the night in feverish excitement , and had been melting and cooling , distilling and mixing.
I heard him sighing like a soul in despair ; I heard him praying , and I noticed how he held his breath.
The lamp was burnt out , but he did not notice it.
said the person_0 ; `` but I only fanned the glowing coals , and accompanied him through the door to where his daughters sat shivering.
His coat was powdered with ashes , and there were ashes in his beard and in his tangled hair.
He stood straight up , and held his costly treasure on high , in the brittle glass.
Then there was another kind of sweeping clean at Waldemar Daa 's , in the mansion of Borreby.
His enemy , Owe Rainel , of Basnaes , was there with the mortgage of the house and everything it contained in his pocket.
I drummed against the broken window-panes , beat against the old rotten doors , and whistled through cracks and rifts -- huh-sh ! Mr.
Owe Rainel did not like staying there.
I listened to hear what occurred.
-LRB- Illustration : LEAVING THE OLD HOME.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` It was hard on that day to preserve one 's composure ; but their will was as hard as their fortune.
`` Ida walked on one side of the old man , and Anna Dorothea on the other.
Joanna turned round at the entrance -- why ? Fortune would not turn because she did so.
And forth they went to the far-off land.
' Was she thinking of this old song ? Here were three of them , and their father was with them too.
`` Daa and his daughters could not help hearing it.
She lived longer than the rest ; she knew all.
`` That is a house to be looked at , but not to be touched ; I must deal gently with it ,"
said the person_0.
`` For the sake of the stork 's nest the hut has been allowed to stand , though it was a blot upon the landscape.
She remembered all that right well , did Anna Dorothea"
` Oh ! oh ! ' Yes , people can sigh like the wind moaning in the rushes and reeds.
` Oh ! oh ! '"
Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant.
`` I took pity on the fairest of the sisters ,"
said the person_0.
`` Her courage was like that of a man , and in man 's clothes she took service as a sailor on board of a ship.
She was sparing of words , and of a dark countenance , but willing at her work.
said the person_0.
`` There was no window , only a hole in the wall.
The sun rose up like a mass of gold , and looked through.
`` The stork covered her hut till her death.
I sang at her grave !"
said the person_0.
`` I sang at her father 's grave ; I know where his grave is , and where hers is , and nobody else knows it.
Tell it better , any of you , if you know how ,"
said the person_0 , and turned away -- and he was gone"
If such exist , and here will come , I swear I 'll show him ev ` ry lib ` ral princely care.
OUR Roman , having satisfied his eyes , At length withdrew , confounded by surprise.
Who follows courts , must oft with care conceal , And scarcely know what sight and ears reveal.
To those , from whom just credence I receive , Their tales I promise fully to believe.
Let us some pleasing fair-one then engage , To serve us both : -- enough she 'll prove I 'll wage.
On hearing this the rustick lad proposed , To visit her when others ' eyes were closed.
Oh ! never risk it , quickly she replied ; ` Twere folly to attempt it by their side.
He answer 'd , never fear , but only leave The door ajar , and me they 'll not perceive.
IT may , replied the king , for ever last , If ev ` ry night like this , I 'm doom 'd to fast.
THE girl with blushing cheeks before them kneel 'd , And the mysterious tale at once reveal 'd.
It was quite late in the fall , and the weather had grown very cold.
Mrs.
person_0 was the only one of her children that was not asleep ; and he complained of being very hungry.
So Mrs.
Coon decided to take him with her.
The hunting was not very good.
There were no birds ' eggs at all to be found in the trees.
The river and the brook and the creek were all frozen over , so person_0 and his mother could not catch any fish.
And as for corn -- Farmer Green had long ago gathered the last ear of it.
person_0 wished that it was summertime.
But it only made him hungrier than ever , to think of all the good things to eat that summer brings.
He was feeling very unhappy when his mother said to him sharply -- `` Run up this tree ! Hurry , now ! Do n't ask any questions"
Now , person_0 did not always mind his mother as quickly as he might have.
But this time he saw that she had stopped and was sniffing the air as if there was something about it she did not like.
That was enough for person_0.
He scrambled up the nearest tree.
For he knew that his mother had discovered danger of some sort.
Mrs.
Coon followed close behind person_0.
And they had.
no sooner hidden in the branches than person_0 saw what it was that his mother had smelled.
It was Johnnie Green ! He passed right underneath the tree where they were perched.
And as Mrs.
Coon peeped down at him she shuddered and shivered and shook so hard that person_0 could n't help noticing it.
`` What 's the matter ?"
he asked , as soon as Johnnie Green was out of sight.
`` His cap !"
Mrs.
Coon exclaimed.
`` He is wearing a coon-skin cap !"
Now do you wonder that she was upset ? `` Do n't ever go near Farmer Green 's house ,"
she warned person_0.
`` No , indeed , Mother !"
person_0 was quite sure that such an adventure would n't please him at all.
And he told himself right then and there that he would never go anywhere near Farmer Green 's house.
We shall see how well person_0 remembered.
That very afternoon person_0 Coon heard some very pleasant news.
It was Jasper Jay who told him.
Jasper Jay was a very noisy blue jay who lived in the neighborhood.
He did not go south with most of the other birds when the cold weather came.
He liked the winter and he was forever tearing about the woods , squalling and scolding at everybody.
He was a very noisy fellow.
Well ! when person_0 and his mother had reached home after their hunt , person_0 stayed out of doors.
It was there that Jasper Jay found him and told him the pleasant news.
And person_0 was very glad to hear the news , because he was still hungry.
`` If I liked turkeys I would certainly go down there some night and get one ,"
said Jasper Jay"
THERE were once a little brother and a little sister , who loved each other with all their hearts.
The children ran about it , and caught each other , and played at counting out.
`` Eneke Beneke , let me live , And I to thee my bird will give.
The little bird , it straw shall seek , The straw I 'll give to the cow to eat.
The pretty cow shall give me milk , The milk I 'll to the baker take.
The baker he shall bake a cake , The cake I 'll give unto the cat.
The cat shall catch some mice for that , The mice I 'll hang up in the smoke , And then you 'll see the snow"
As they were running about so merrily the step-mother watched them from the window , and grew angry.
Thus passed a long time , and then strangers came as visitors to the castle.
The false step-mother thought , `` This is a good opportunity ,"
and called the cook and said to him , `` Go and fetch the lamb from the meadow and kill it , we have nothing else for the visitors"
Then the cook went away and got the lamb , and took it into the kitchen and tied its feet , and all this it bore patiently.
The little fish answered , `` Ah , little sister , up on high How sad is my poor heart While in this pond I lie"
Then said he , `` Be easy , I will not kill thee ,"
In the day-time she changed herself into a cat or a screech-owl , but in the evening she took her proper shape again as a human being.
She could lure wild beasts and birds to her , and then she killed and boiled and roasted them.
She had about seven thousand cages of rare birds in the castle.
Now , there was once a maiden who was called Jorinda , who was fairer than all other girls.
She and a handsome youth named Joringel had promised to marry each other.
They were still in the days of betrothal , and their greatest happiness was being together.
One day in order that they might be able to talk together in quiet they went for a walk in the forest.
`` Take care ,"
said Joringel , `` that you do not go too near the castle"
Jorinda wept now and then : she sat down in the sunshine and was sorrowful.
Joringel was sorrowful too ; they were as sad as if they were about to die.
Then they looked around them , and were quite at a loss , for they did not know by which way they should go home.
The sun was still half above the mountain and half set.
Joringel looked through the bushes , and saw the old walls of the castle close at hand.
He was horror-stricken and filled with deadly fear.
Joringel looked for Jorinda.
She was changed into a nightingale , and sang , `` jug , jug , jug"
A screech-owl with glowing eyes flew three times round about her , and three times cried , `` to-whoo , to-whoo , to-whoo !"
Joringel could not move : he stood there like a stone , and could neither weep nor speak , nor move hand or foot.
The sun had now set.
She muttered to herself , caught the nightingale , and took it away in her hand.
Joringel could neither speak nor move from the spot ; the nightingale was gone.
At last the woman came back , and said in a hollow voice , `` Greet thee , Zachiel.
If the moon shines on the cage , Zachiel , let him loose at once"
Then Joringel was freed.
He called , he wept , he lamented , but all in vain , `` Ah , what is to become of me ?"
Joringel went away , and at last came to a strange village ; there he kept sheep for a long time.
He often walked round and round the castle , but not too near to it.
In the morning , when he awoke , he began to seek over hill and dale if he could find such a flower.
He sought until the ninth day , and then , early in the morning , he found the blood-red flower.
In the middle of it there was a large dew-drop , as big as the finest pearl.
Day and night he journeyed with this flower to the castle.
When he was within a hundred paces of it he was not held fast , but walked on to the door.
Joringel was full of joy ; he touched the door with the flower , and it sprang open.
He walked in through the courtyard , and listened for the sound of the birds.
At last he heard it.
He went on and found the room from whence it came , and there the witch was feeding the birds in the seven thousand cages.
Swiftly he sprang towards her , touched the cage with the flower , and also the old woman.
She could now no longer bewitch any one ; and Jorinda was standing there , clasping him round the neck , and she was as beautiful as ever !"
`` Just go , Frederick ,"
answered Kate , `` just go , I will have all ready for you"
Then it occurred to her , `` While the sausage is getting done thou couldst go into the cellar and draw beer"
So she set the frying-pan safely on the fire , took a can , and went down into the cellar to draw beer.
Well thought of"
`` What 's gone is gone !"
said Kate , and turned round , and as she had run till she was weary , she walked quietly and comfortably , and cooled herself.
During this time the beer was still running out of the cask , for Kate had not turned the tap.
As soon as Kate was on the steps she saw the mischance.
`` Good gracious !"
she cried.
`` What shall I do now to stop Frederick knowing it !"
`` Yes ,"
said she , `` he who saves a thing when he ought , has it afterwards when he needs it ,"
`` It is all right ,"
said Kate , `` where the one is the other ought to be also ,"
and she strewed the meal over the whole cellar.
When it was done she was heartily delighted with her work , and said , `` How clean and wholesome it does look here !"
At mid-day home came Frederick : `` Now , wife , what have you ready for me ?"
`` Ah , Freddy ,"
`` Indeed , Frederick , I did not know that , you should have told me"
The man thought , `` If my wife is like this , I must look after things more"
Said she , `` Oh , no , Frederick , I certainly will not go"
said Catherine , `` I have no money and can buy nothing , but if you have any use for yellow counters I will buy of you"
`` Yellow counters , why not ? But just let us see them"
`` Then go into the stable and dig under the cow 's manger , and you will find the yellow counters.
I am not allowed to go there"
The rogues went thither , dug and found pure gold.
Then they laid hold of it , ran away , and left their pots and bowls behind in the house.
When Frederick came and saw the new decorations , he said , `` Catherine , what have you been about ?"
`` I have bought them , Frederick , for the counters which were under the cow 's manger.
I did not go there myself , the pedlars had to dig them out for themselves"
`` Ah , wife ,"
said Frederick , `` what have you done ? Those were not counters , but pure gold , and all our wealth ; you should not have done that"
`` Indeed , Frederick ,"
said she , `` I did not know that , you should have forewarned me"
`` Come , then ,"
said Frederick , `` we will try it ; but take with you some butter and cheese that we may have something to eat on the way"
`` Yes , Frederick , I will take them"
They set out , and as Frederick was the better walker , Catherine followed him.
`` It is to my advantage ,"
thought she , `` when we turn back I shall be a little way in advance"
Then she came to a hill where there were deep ruts on both sides of the road.
`` There one can see ,"
said Catherine , `` how they have torn and skinned and galled the poor earth , it will never be whole again as long as it lives ,"
Said Catherine , `` I have made my way once up here , I will not go down again ; another may run and fetch it back"
So she took another cheese and rolled it down.
But the cheeses did not come back , so she let a third run down , thinking.
`` Perhaps they are waiting for company , and do not like to walk alone"
But the fourth did no better than the third.
Then Catherine was angry , and threw down the fifth and sixth as well , and these were her last.
Catherine went on and found Frederick , who was standing waiting for her because he wanted something to eat.
`` Now just let us have what you have brought with you ,"
said he.
She gave him the dry bread.
`` Where have you the butter and the cheeses ?"
asked the man.
`` Ah , Freddy ,"
`` Really , Frederick , you should have told me"
Then they ate the dry bread together , and Frederick said , `` Catherine , did you make the house safe when you came away ?"
`` No , Frederick , you should have told me to do it before"
`` Then go home again , and make the house safe before we go any farther , and bring with you something else to eat.
I will wait here for you"
Catherine took her time on the way , and thought , `` Frederick will rest himself so much the longer"
When she had once reached him she said , `` Here is the house-door for you , Frederick , and now you can take care of the house yourself"
`` Oh , heavens ,"
It is now too late to go back home again , but since you have brought the door here , you shall just carry it farther"
And now they went into the forest , and sought the rogues , but did not find them.
At length as it grew dark they climbed into a tree and resolved to spend the night there.
They sat down under the very tree in which Frederick and Catherine were sitting , lighted a fire , and were about to share their booty.
Frederick got down on the other side and collected some stones together.
Then he climbed up again with them , and wished to throw them at the thieves and kill them.
The stones , however , did not hit them , and the knaves cried , `` It will soon be morning , the wind is shaking down the fir-apples"
`` No , Catherine , not now ,"
he replied , `` they might betray us"
`` Oh , but , Frederick , I must ! They weigh me down far too much"
`` Do it , then , and be hanged !"
Then the dried pears rolled down between the branches , and the rascals below said , `` The leaves are falling"
A short time afterwards , as the door was still heavy , Catherine said , `` Ah , Frederick , I must pour out the vinegar"
`` No , Catherine , you must not , it might betray us"
`` Ah , but , Frederick , I must , it weighs me down far too much"
`` Then do it and be hanged !"
So she emptied out the vinegar , and it besprinkled the robbers.
They said amongst themselves , `` The dew is already falling"
At length Catherine thought , `` Can it really be the door which weighs me down so ?"
and said , `` Frederick , I must throw the door down"
`` No , not now , Catherine , it might discover us"
`` Oh , but , Frederick , I must.
It weighs me down far too much"
`` Oh , no , Catherine , do hold it fast"
`` Ah , Frederick , I am letting it fall !"
`` Let it go , then , in the devil 's name"
Then it fell down with a violent clatter , and the rascals below cried , `` The devil is coming down the tree !"
and they ran away and left everything behind them.
Early next morning , when the two came down they found all their gold again , and carried it home.
When they were once more at home , Frederick said , `` And now , Catherine , you , too , must be industrious and work"
`` Yes , Frederick , I will soon do that , I will go into the field and cut corn"
In the meantime night came , and Catherine ran into the village , knocked at her husband 's window , and cried , `` Frederick"
`` What is the matter ?"
`` I should very much like to know if Catherine is in ?"
`` Yes , yes ,"
replied Frederick , `` she must be in and asleep"
Said she ,"
` Tis well , then I am certainly at home already ,"
and ran away.
Outside Catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal.
Then she went to them and said , `` I will help you to steal"
The rascals thought that she knew the situation of the place , and were willing.
Catherine went in front of the houses , and cried , `` Good folks , have you anything ? We want to steal"
The thieves thought to themselves , `` That 's a fine way of doing things ,"
and wished themselves once more rid of Catherine.
Then they said to her , `` Outside the village the pastor has some turnips in the field.
Go there and pull up some turnips for us"
Catherine went to the ground , and began to pull them up , but was so idle that she did not gather them together.
Then a man came by , saw her , and stood still and thought that it was the devil who was thus rooting amongst the turnips.
He ran away into the village to the pastor , and said , `` Mr.
Pastor , the devil is in your turnip-ground , rooting up turnips"
`` Ah , heavens ,"
answered the pastor , `` I have a lame foot , I can not go out and drive him away"
Said the man , `` Then I will carry you on my back ,"
and he carried him out on his back.
And when they came to the ground , Catherine arose and stood up her full height.
`` Ah , the devil !"
Seven Swabians were once together.
Master person_0 was so terrified that he all but dropped the spear , and a cold perspiration broke out over his whole body.
`` Hark ! hark !"
cried he to his comrades , `` Good heavens ! I hear a drum"
`` Oh dear ! Oh dear !"
screamed Master person_0.
`` Take me prisoner ; I surrender ! I surrender !"
Then they journeyed onwards.
The second danger which they survived can not be compared with the first.
Some days afterwards , their path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting sleeping in the sun.
Her ears were standing straight up , and her great glassy eyes were wide open.
For if they were to run away , they knew that the monster would pursue and swallow them whole.
So they said , `` We must go through a great and dangerous struggle.
Boldly ventured , is half won ,"
and all seven grasped the spear , Master person_0 in front , and Veitli behind.
Michal cried , `` Nothing is wanting , not even a hair , Be sure the Devil himself is there"
And now Marli had a bright thought , and said to Veitli , `` Advance , Veitli , advance , advance , And I behind will hold the lance"
Hereupon they all together set on the dragon.
in the greatest anguish.
This awakened the hare , which in great alarm darted swiftly away.
When Master person_0 saw her thus flying from the field of battle , he cried in his joy.
`` Quick , Veitli , quick , look there , look there , The monster 's nothing but a hare !"
The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted , and he said `` What ? what ?"
in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves.
Master person_0 thought he was saying , `` Wade , wade through the water ,"
and as he was the first , began to set out and went into the moselle.

WITHIN her village , Anne was thought the belle , And ev ` ry other charmer to excel.
WHEN such sensations once were in the breast , Love there we may believe would hardly rest.
THE favors Anne reserved he thought his own , Though expectations oft away have flown.
WHEN Easter came , new difficulties rose Then , in confession , ALL she should disclose.
The dinner o ` er without th ' expected dish , Or even a shadow of the promised fish.
When William learned the present Anne had made , His wish , to have it canceled , with her weighed.
No man 's exempt from evils such as these : -- Who thinks himself secure , but little sees.
He , whose adventures I 'm about to write , In his mischances , -- found what gave delight.
At present love is little more than name : In matrimony , gold 's the only aim.
The belle was rich , while he had nothing got ; For him 'twas great : -- for her a narrow lot.
But when four months had passed , the fair-one showed.
On this the son-in-law the bond received , And , with a bow , departed much relieved.

At mother 's apron string all day person_1 whiled the weary hours away , And shared her bed all night.
Such love In parents we must all approve , Though Catherine , I must confess , In place of so much tenderness More liberty would have preferred.
Kitty could No moment steal , do what she would , person_0 see her Richard.
Sorely vexed She was , and he still more perplexed.
In spite of all he might devise A squeeze , a kiss , quick talk of eyes Was all he could obtain , no more.
Bread butterless , a sanded floor , It seemed no better.
Joy like this Could not suffice , more sterling bliss Our lovers wished , nor would stop short Till they 'd obtained the thing they sought.
And thus it came about.
One day By chance they met , alone , away From jealous parents.
`` What 's the use ;"
person_1 answered : `` Were it not too plain `` How warm my love , another strain `` I would employ.
In converse vain `` Let us not waste our moments few ; `` But think what it were best to do"
`` If you will please me ,"
It was not easy , you 'll admit , But love lends foolish maidens wit ; And this is how she managed it.
This is not strange.
A longing girl , With thoughts of sweetheart in her head , In bed all night will sleepless twirl.
A flea is in her ear , ` tis said.
The morning broke.
Of fleas and heat Kitty complained.
`` Let me entreat , `` O mother , I may put my bed `` Out in the gallery ,"
she said ,"
` Tis cooler there , and Philomel `` Who warbles in the neigh ` bring dell `` Will solace me"
Ready consent The simple mother gave , and went person_0 seek her spouse.
`` Our person_1 , my dear , `` Will change her bed that she may hear `` The nightingale , and sleep more cool"
`` Wife ,"
said the good man , `` You 're a fool , `` And person_1 too with her nightingale ; `` Do n't tell me such a foolish tale.
`` She must remain.
No doubt to-night `` Will fresher be.
I sleep all right `` In spite of heat , and so can she.
`` Is she more delicate than me ?"
Incensed was person_1 by this denial After so promising a trial , Nor would be beat , but firmly swore person_0 give more trouble than before.
`` Our person_1 `` person_0 me seems greatly changed of late.
`` You are unkind ,"
she said to him , `` person_0 thwart her simple , girlish whim.
`` You do not love your child , and will `` With your unkindness make her ill"
`` Pray cease ,"
the husband cried , `` to scold `` And take your whim.
I ne'er could hold `` My own against a screaming wife ; `` You 'll drive me mad , upon my life.
`` Her belly-full our person_1 may get `` Of nightingale or of linnet"
The thing was settled.
person_1 obeyed , And in a trice her bed was made , And lover signalled.
The longest , most abstruse discourse Would lack precision , want the force Their youthful ardor to portray.
person_0 understand there 's but one way -- Experience.
The nightingale Sang all night long his pleasing tale , And though he made but little noise , The lass was satisfied.
`` I 'll see the influence ,"
he said , `` Of nightingale and change of bed"
With bated breath , upon tip toes , Close to the couch he cautious goes Where Kitty lay in calm repose.
Excessive heat had made all clothes Unbearable.
The sleeping pair Had cast them off , and lay as bare As our first happy parents were In Paradise.
The mother almost wept for glee.
`` A nightingale , oh ! let me see.
Despite his grief the good man smiled.
`` Much more than you expect you 'll see.
Who was surprised ? It was the dame.
`` For their good offices I wait `` person_0 set this nasty matter straight"
`` All will go well ,"
They wrote , they signed , the sealed -- and thus The wedding ended free from fuss.
They left the happy couple there.
Adam dug up the land , and Eve span.
Every year Eve brought a child into the world ; but the children were unlike each other , some pretty , and some ugly.
After a considerable time had gone by , God sent an angel to them , to announce that he was coming to inspect their household.
Eve , delighted that the person_0 should be so gracious , cleaned her house diligently , decked it with flowers , and strewed reeds on the floor.
Then she brought in her children , but only the beautiful ones.
They were to bow down before him civilly , hold out their hands , and to answer his questions modestly and sensibly.
The ugly children were , however , not to let themselves be seen.
She had scarcely got ready , before there was a knock at the house-door.
Adam looked through a chink , and saw that it was the person_0.
Adam opened the door respectfully , and the Heavenly Father entered.
There , in a row , stood the pretty children , and bowed before him , held out their hands , and knelt down.
The person_0 , however , began to bless them , laid his hands on the first , and said , `` Thou shalt be a powerful king ;"
and to the second , `` Thou a prince ,"
to the third , `` Thou a count ,"
to the fourth , `` Thou a knight ,"
to the fifth , `` Thou a nobleman ,"
to the sixth , `` Thou a burgher ,"
to the seventh , `` Thou a merchant ,"
to the eighth , `` Thou a learned man"
He bestowed upon them also all his richest blessings.
So she ran and brought them out of the hay , the straw , the stove , and wherever else she had concealed them.
Then came the whole coarse , dirty , shabby , sooty band.
The person_0 smiled , looked at them all , and said , `` I will bless these also"
He laid his hands on the first , and said to him , `` Thou shalt be a peasant ,"
to the second , `` Thou a fisherman ,"
to the third , `` Thou a smith ,"
to the fourth , `` Thou a tanner ,"
to the fifth , `` Thou a weaver ,"
to the sixth , `` Thou a shoemaker ,"
to the seventh , `` Thou a tailor ,"
to the eighth , `` Thou a potter ,"
to the ninth , `` Thou a waggoner ,"
to the tenth , `` Thou a sailor ,"
to the eleventh , `` Thou an errand-boy ,"
to the twelfth , `` Thou a scullion all the days of thy life"
But God answered , `` Eve , thou dost not understand.
Then Eve answered , `` Ah , person_0 , forgive me , I was too quick in speaking to thee.
Have thy divine will with my children"
One day person_0 Coon was strolling along the brook which flowed not far from his home.
He stopped now and then , to crouch close to the water 's edge , in the hope of catching a fish.
It was a bug , or a huge fly.
And person_0 was very fond of bugs -- to eat , you know.
So he lost no time.
The bright thing had scarcely settled on the water when person_0 reached out and seized it.
He put it into his mouth , when the strangest thing happened.
person_0 felt himself pulled right over into the water.
He was surprised , for he never knew a bug or a fly to be so strong as that.
Something pricked his cheek and person_0 thought that the bright thing had stung him.
He tried to take it out of his mouth , and he was surprised again.
Whatever the thing was , it seemed to be stuck fast in his mouth.
And all the time person_0 was being dragged along through the water.
He began to be frightened.
And for the first time he noticed that there was a slender line which stretched from his mouth straight across the pool.
His mouth hurt ; but he plunged and pulled just the same , and jerked his head and squirmed and wriggled and twisted.
At least , that was what person_0 Coon thought.
And he swam quickly to the bank and scampered into the bushes.
Now , this was what really happened.
Farmer Green had come up the brook to catch trout.
On the end of his fish-line he had tied a make-believe fly , with a hook hidden under its red and yellow wings.
He had stolen along the brook very quietly , so that he would n't frighten the fish.
And he had made so little noise that person_0 Coon never heard him at all.
Farmer Green had not seen person_0 , crouched as he was among the stones.
And when person_0 reached out and grabbed the make-believe fly Farmer Green was even more surprised at what happened than person_0 himself.
If the fish-hook had n't worked loose from person_0 's mouth Farmer Green would have caught the queerest fish anybody ever caught , almost.
Something seemed to amuse Farmer Green , as he watched person_0 dive into the bushes ; and he laughed loud and long.
But person_0 Coon did n't laugh at all.
His mouth was too sore ; and he was too frightened.
But he was very , very glad that the strange bug had flown away"
It is more than a hundred years ago.
Behind the wood , by the great lake , stood the old baronial mansion.
Round about it lay a deep moat , in which grew reeds and grass.
Close by the bridge , near the entrance-gate , rose an old willow tree that bent over the reeds.
She was still half a child , and had a pretty light figure , and a gentle expression in her face , with two clear blue eyes.
`` Everything in its place ,"
he cried ; `` into the puddle with you !"
It was the hand of a pedlar , who had seen from a short distance what had happened , and who now hurried up to give aid.
`` Everything in its right place ,"
he said , mimicking the gracious baron ; and he drew the little maiden up to the firm ground.
He would have restored the broken branch to the place from which it had been torn , but `` everything in its place"
can not always be managed , and therefore he stuck the piece in the ground.
`` Grow and prosper till you can furnish a good flute for them up yonder ,"
he said ; for he would have liked to play the `` rogue 's march"
for my lord the baron , and my lord 's whole family.
Loud laughter , mingled with the barking and howling of dogs , sounded through the windows , for there was feasting and carousing up yonder.
Wine and strong old ale foamed in the jugs and glasses , and the dogs sat with their masters and dined with them.
They had the pedlar summoned upstairs , but only to make fun of him.
The wine had mounted into their heads , and the sense had flown out.
And then whole farms , with oxen and peasants too , were staked on a card , and won and lost.
`` Everything in its right place !"
said the pedlar , when he had at last made his escape out of what he called `` the Sodom and Gomorrah up yonder"
`` The open high-road is my right place ,"
he said ; `` I did not feel at all happy there"
And the little maiden who sat keeping the geese nodded at him in a friendly way , as he strode along beside the hedges.
But from that hour no more card-playing was permitted there.
`` That is bad reading ,"
said he : `` when the Evil One saw a Bible for the first time , he wanted to put a bad book against it , and invented card-playing"
It was a good thing now to be in the old mansion.
The mother managed the domestic affairs , and the father superintended the estate , and it seemed as if blessings were streaming down.
Where rectitude enters in , prosperity is sure to follow.
The old house was cleaned and painted , the ditches were cleared and fruit trees planted.
Everything wore a bright cheerful look , and the floors were as polished as a draught board.
In the meantime the willow branch at the castle-gate had grown to be a splendid tree , which stood there free and self-sustained.
`` That is our genealogical tree ,"
And a hundred years rolled by.
It was in our own time.
The lake had been converted to moorland , and the old mansion had almost disappeared.
A field-path led close by the old tree.
The grand flight of steps that led to the entrance looked like a bower of roses and broad-leaved plants.
The lawn was as freshly green as if each separate blade of grass were cleaned morning and evening.
Yes , truly , wealthy people lived here , people of rank : the baron with his family.
All things here corresponded with each other.
The motto was still `` Everything in its right place ;"
The pictures represented the Councillor of Justice and his lady , the founders of the present family.
`` But they did not properly belong to our family ,"
said one of the little barons.
`` He was a dealer , and she had kept the geese.
They were not like papa and mamma"
The pictures were pronounced to be worthless ; and as the motto was `` Everything in its right place ,"
the great-grandmother and great-grandfather had been sent into the passage that led to the servants ' hall.
The son of the neighbouring clergyman was tutor in the great house.
and the flowers formed a pretty whole.
She had a good hearty disposition , with true nobility of thought and soul , and a heart full of love for all that God hath created.
The party came to a halt at the old willow tree.
The youngest baron insisted on having such a flute cut for him from it as he had had made of other willows.
Accordingly the tutor broke off a branch.
`` Oh , do n't do that !"
cried the young baroness ; but it was done already.
`` That is our famous old tree ,"
she continued , `` and I love it dearly.
They laugh at me at home for this , but I do n't mind.
There is a story attached to this tree"
`` They would not be ennobled , the good old folks !"
she said.
`` They were charming , sensible people ,"
said the clergyman 's son ; and with this the conversation naturally fell upon nobles and citizens.
The young man scarcely seemed to belong to the citizen class , so well did he speak concerning the purpose and meaning of nobility.
It is delightful to have a name that serves as a card of admission into the highest circles.
Nobility means that which is great and noble : it is a coin that has received a stamp to indicate what it is worth.
But that is not my view , for I consider it entirely false.
In the higher classes many beautiful and kindly traits are found.
My mother told me one of this kind , and I could tell you many others.
`` My mother was on a visit to a great family in town.
My grandmother , I think , had been housekeeper to the count 's mother.
The great nobleman and my mother were alone in the room , when the former noticed that an old woman came limping on crutches into the courtyard.
Indeed , she was accustomed to come every Sunday , and carry away a gift with her.
This was the speech of the clergyman 's son.
It was certainly rather long , but then the flute was being finished while he made it.
At the castle there was a great company.
Many guests came from the neighborhood and from the capital.
Many ladies , some tastefully , and others tastelessly dressed , were there , and the great hall was quite full of people.
The clergymen from the neighborhood stood respectfully congregated in a corner , which made it look almost as if there were to be a burial there.
But it was not so , for this was a party of pleasure , only that the pleasure had not yet begun.
There was instrumental music and song , both of the kind that delight the performers most -- quite charming ! `` You are a performer ?"
said a cavalier -- his father 's son and nothing else -- to the tutor.
`` You play the flute and make it too -- that 's genius.
That should command , and should have the place of honor !"
`` No indeed ,"
replied the young man , `` I only advance with the times , as every one is obliged to do"
`` Oh , you will enchant us with the little instrument , will you not ?"
For a whole mile round about the sounds of the flute were heard , and singular events took place.
Two rich peasants who in our times had grown too high for their corn-fields , were tumbled into the ditch.
`` Everything in its right place"
The day afterwards not a word was said about this marvellous event ; and thence has come the expression `` pocketing the flute"
Everything was in its usual order , only that the two old portraits of the dealer and the goose-girl hung on the wall in the banqueting hall.
`` Everything in its right place"
And to that it will come ; for _ hereafter _ is long -- longer than this story"
An old story yet lives of the `` Thorny Road of Honour ,"
of a marksman , who indeed attained to rank and office , but only after a lifelong and weary strife against difficulties.
Who has not , in reading this story , thought of his own strife , and of his own numerous `` difficulties ?"
Let us contemplate here and there one of the company of martyrs -- the company which will receive new members until the world itself shall pass away.
We look down upon a crowded amphitheatre.

His song yet lives , and through that alone live all the heroes and gods of antiquity.

would die of hunger.
Now , a costly monument marks the grave of Camoens.
There is a new picture.
Behind the iron grating a man appears , pale as death , with long unkempt beard.
`` I have made a discovery ,"
he says , `` the greatest that has been made for centuries ; and they have kept me locked up here for more than twenty years !"
`` Who is the man ? `` A madman ,"
replies the keeper of the madhouse.
`` What whimsical ideas these lunatics have ! He imagines that one can propel things by means of steam.

With his finger he marks out a groove in the stone table.

Let us remember his improvements of seven and twenty years , if we can not forget his crime.
A ship sails away , quitting the Danish shores ; a man leans against the mast , casting a last glance towards the Island Hueen.
It is Tycho Brahe.
He raised the name of Denmark to the stars , and was rewarded with injury , loss , and sorrow.
He is going to a strange country.
`` The vault of heaven is above me everywhere ,"
he says , `` and what do I want more ?"
And away sails the famous Dane , the astronomer , to live honored and free in a strange land.
`` Ay , free , if only from the unbearable sufferings of the body !"
comes in a sigh through time , and strikes upon our ear.
What a picture ! Griffenfeldt , a Danish Prometheus , bound to the rocky island of Munkholm.
The ship begins its passage , but suddenly it stops.
The crowd begins to laugh and whistle and hiss -- the very father of the man whistles with the rest.
`` Conceit ! Foolery !"
is the cry.
`` It has happened just as he deserved : put the crack-brain under lock and key !"
The she-wolf brought forth a young one , and invited the fox to be godfather.
`` After all , he is a near relative of ours ,"
said she , `` he has a good understanding , and much talent ; he can instruct my little son , and help him forward in the world"
The fox , too , appeared quite honest , and said , `` Worthy Mrs.
He enjoyed himself at the feast , and made merry ; afterwards he said , `` Dear Mrs.
Gossip , it is our duty to take care of the child , it must have good food that it may be strong.
I know a sheep-fold from which we might fetch a nice morsel"
The wolf was pleased with the ditty , and she went out with the fox to the farm-yard.
He , however , did not go there , but sat down at the entrance to the forest , stretched his legs and rested.
The she-wolf crept into the stable.
At last she escaped , and dragged herself outside.
Then the fox cried to her , `` Farewell , dear Mistress Gossip , may the roasting you have had do you good ,"
laughed heartily at her , and bounded off"
Heavy clouds obscured the sky , and the person_0 did not make his appearance at all.
I stood in my little room , more lonely than ever , and looked up at the sky where he ought to have shown himself.
My thoughts flew far away , up to my great friend , who every evening told me such pretty tales , and showed me pictures.
Yes , he has had an experience indeed.
When the Children of Israel sat weeping by the waters of Babylon , he glanced mournfully upon the willows where hung the silent harps.
He saw the captive giant at St.
Helena , looking from the lonely rock across the wide ocean , while great thoughts swept through his soul.
Ah ! what tales the person_0 can tell.
Human life is like a story to him.
To-night I shall not see thee again , old friend.
To-night I can draw no picture of the memories of thy visit.
And , as I looked dreamily towards the clouds , the sky became bright.
There was a glancing light , and a beam from the person_0 fell upon me.
It vanished again , and dark clouds flew past ; but still it was a greeting , a friendly good-night offered to me by the person_0"
A disbanded soldier had nothing to live on , and did not know how to get on.
The little man said to him , `` What ails you , you seem so very sorrowful ?"
Then the soldier said , `` I am hungry , but have no money"
The soldier said , `` All right , if there is no help for it ,"
and went off with the little man , who straightway led him down into hell.
Then he told him what he had to do.
The soldier said , `` Good , I will take care"
When the old Devil came back again , he looked to see if all had been done , appeared satisfied , and went forth a second time.
`` Aha , old bird !"
said he , `` Do I meet you here ? You once had me in your power , now I have you ,"
and he quickly let the lid fall , poked the fire , and added a fresh log.
After that , he went to the second kettle , raised its lid also a little , and peeped in ; his former ensign was in that.
`` Aha , old bird , so I find you here ! you once had me in your power , now I have you"
He closed the lid again , and fetched yet another log to make it really hot.
Then he wanted to see who might be sitting up in the third kettle it was actually be but a general.
`` Aha , old bird , do I meet you here ? Once you had me in your power , now I have you"
And he fetched the bellows and made hell-fire blaze right under him.
Now when the time had fully gone by , the Devil came and said , `` Well Hans , what have you done ?"
`` I poked the fire under the kettles , and I have swept all the dirt well behind the doors"
`` Yes ,"
said the soldier , `` I should very much like to see what my father is doing at home"
and when you are asked who you are , you are to say , `` The Devil 's sooty brother , and my King as well"
The soldier held his peace , and did as the Devil bade him , but he was not at all satisfied with his wages.
`` I should never have expected that ,"
said he , and was well pleased , and entered the town.
He called to him and asked , `` Whence comest thou ?"
`` From hell"
`` Who art thou ?"
`` The Devil 's sooty brother , and my King as well"
Then the host would not let him enter , but when Hans showed him the gold , he came and unlatched the door himself.
and straightway went back again to hell , complained of his misfortune to the old Devil , and begged for his help.
Then the landlord gave him the money , and more besides , only begging him to keep it secret , and Hans was now a rich man.
Then like a father-confessor he dressed , And took his seat where priests their flock confessed.
Goon heav ` ns ! exclaimed the knight , ` tis very clear , And I a blockhead surely must appear"
And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears.
Once , too , his trembling hands could not hold the bowl , and it fell to the ground and broke.
The young wife scolded him , but he said nothing and only sighed.
Then they bought him a wooden bowl for a few half-pence , out of which he had to eat.
They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground.
`` What are you doing there ?"
asked the father.
`` I am making a little trough ,"
answered the child , `` for father and mother to eat out of when I am big"
The man and his wife looked at each other for a while , and presently began to cry.
The mother was afraid when she heard that , and wept no more.
The geese cackled with terror , sprang up , and began to wail and beg piteously for their lives.
But the fox would listen to nothing , and said , `` There is no mercy to be had ! You must die"
`` Yes ,"
said the fox , `` that is reasonable , and a pious request.
Pray away , I will wait till you are done"
Then the first began a good long prayer , for ever saying , `` Ga ! Ga !"
and as she would make no end , the second did not wait until her turn came , but began also , `` Ga ! Ga !"
The third and fourth followed her , and soon they were all cackling together.
When they have done praying , the story shall be continued further , but at present they are still praying without stopping"
During the first few days I went to live in the town , I felt low-spirited and solitary enough.
Instead of the forest and the green hills of former days , I had here only a forest of chimney-pots to look out upon.
And then I had not a single friend ; not one familiar face greeted me.
So one evening I sat at the window , in a desponding mood ; and presently I opened the casement and looked out.
In , fact it was the MOON that looked in upon me.
This promise he has faithfully kept.
It is a pity that he can only stay such a short time when he comes.
Whenever he appears , he tells me of one thing or another that he has seen on the previous night , or on that same evening.
`` Just paint the scenes I describe to you"
-- this is what he said to me -- `` and you will have a very pretty picture-book"
I have followed his injunction for many evenings.
I could make up a new `` Thousand and One Nights ,"
in my own way , out of these pictures , but the number might be too great , after all.
The pictures I have here given have not been chosen at random , but follow in their proper order , just as they were described to me.
ONE morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.
He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot , trit-trot of a pony.
A gig was coming along the road ; it was driven by person_2.
Mcperson_1 , and beside him sat person_2s.
Mcperson_1 in her best bonnet.
Mcperson_1 's garden.
THAT wood was full of rabbit holes ; and in the neatest sandiest hole of all , cousins -- Flopsy , Mopsy , Cotton-tail and Peter.
Old person_2s.
Rabbit was a widow ; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffetees -LRB- I once bought a pair at a bazaar -RRB-.
She also sold herbs , and rosemary tea , and rabbit-tobacco -LRB- which is what WE call lavender -RRB-.
LITTLE person_0 did not very much want to see his Aunt.
He came round the back of the fir-tree , and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.
PETER was sitting by himself.
He looked poorly , and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.
`` Peter ,"
-- said little person_0 , in a whisper -- `` who has got your clothes ?"
PETER replied -- `` The scarecrow in person_2.
Mcperson_1 's garden ,"
and described how he had been chased about the garden , and had dropped his shoes and coat.
Little person_0 sat down beside his cousin , and assured him that person_2.
Mcperson_1 had gone out in a gig , and person_2s.
Mcperson_1 also ; and certainly for the day , because she was wearing her best bonnet.
PETER said he hoped that it would rain.
At this point , old person_2s.
Rabbit 's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole calling -- `` Cotton-tail ! Cotton-tail ! fetch some more camomile !"
Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.
THEY went away hand in hand , and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood.
From here they looked down into person_2.
Mcperson_1 's garden.
Peter 's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow , topped with an old tam-o - shanter of person_2.
Mcperson_1 's.
Peter fell down head first ; but it was of no consequence , as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.
IT had been sown with lettuces.
They left a great many odd little foot-marks all over the bed , especially little person_0 , who was wearing clogs.
They took them off the scarecrow.
There had been rain during the night ; there was water in the shoes , and the coat was somewhat shrunk.
person_0 tried on the tam - o-shanter , but it was too big for him.
THEN he suggested that they should fill the pocket - handkerchief with onions , as a little present for his Aunt.
Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself ; he kept hearing noises.
BENJAMIN , on the contrary , was perfectly at home , and ate a lettuce leaf.
He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.
-LRB- The name of little person_0 's papa was old person_2.
person_0 Bunny.
-RRB- The lettuces certainly were very fine.
PETER did not eat anything ; he said he should like to go home.
Presently he dropped half the onions.
LITTLE person_0 said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree , with a load of vegetables.
He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden.
They went along a little walk on planks , under a sunny red - brick wall.
The mice sat on their door - steps cracking cherry-stones , they winked at Peter Rabbit and little person_0 Bunny.
PRESENTLY Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.
THE cat got up and stretched herself , and came and sniffed at the basket.
Perhaps she liked the smell of onions ! Anyway , she sat down upon the top of the basket.
SHE sat there for FIVE HOURS.
The sun got round behind the wood , and it was quite late in the afternoon ; but still the cat sat upon the basket.
AT length there was a pitter - patter , pitter-patter , and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.
The cat looked up and saw old person_2.
person_0 Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.
He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco , and had a little switch in his hand.
He was looking for his son.
OLD person_2.
Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.
The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
WHEN old person_2.
Bunny had driven the cat into the green-house , he locked the door.
Then he came back to the basket and took out his son person_0 by the ears , and whipped him with the little switch.
Then he took out his nephew Peter.
THEN he took out the handkerchief of onions , and marched out of the garden.
When person_2.
Mcperson_1 returned about half an hour later , he observed several things which perplexed him.
WHEN Peter got home , his mother forgave him , because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat.
Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket - handkerchief , and old person_2s.
Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling , with the rabbit-tobacco.
The End"
ONCE upon a time there was a little fat comfortable gray squirrel , called person_0.
He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree ; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.
Goody person_1 was busy pushing moss under the thatch -- `` The nest is so snug , we shall be sound asleep all winter"
`` Then we shall wake up all the thinner , when there is nothing to eat in spring-time ,"
replied prudent Timothy.
WHEN person_0 and Goody person_1 came to the nut thicket , they found other squirrels were there already.
person_0 took off his jacket and hung it on a twig ; they worked away quietly by themselves.
EVERY day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts.
They carried them away in bags , and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.
`` How shall you ever get them out again ? It is like a money-box !"
said Goody.
`` I shall be much thinner before spring-time , my love ,"
said person_0 , peeping into the hole.
The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail.
He began to dig , and he could not remember.
And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him ; and there was a fight.
There were several sorts of little birds , twittering different songs.
The first one sang -- `` Who 's bin digging-up MY nuts ? Who 's - been-digging - up MY nuts ?"
And another sang -- `` Little bita bread and-NO-cheese ! Little bit-a-bread an ' - NO - cheese !"
THE squirrels followed and listened.
person_0 went on with his work without replying ; indeed , the little bird did not expect an answer.
It was only singing its natural song , and it meant nothing at all.
BUT when the other squirrels heard that song , they rushed upon person_0 and cuffed and scratched him , and upset his bag of nuts.
THEY caught him and dragged him up the very same tree , where there was the little round hole , and they pushed him in.
The hole was much too small for person_0 ' figure.
They squeezed him dreadfully , it was a wonder they did not break his ribs.
`` We will leave him here till he confesses ,"
said Silvertail Squirrel , and he shouted into the hole -- `` Who 's - been-digging-up MY-nuts ?"
TIMMY TIPTOES made no reply ; he had tumbled down inside the tree , upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself.
He lay quite stunned and still.
GOODY TIPTOES picked up the nut bags and went home.
She made a cup of tea for person_0 ; but he did n't come and did n't come.
Goody person_1 passed a lonely and unhappy night.
Next morning she ventured back to the nut-bushes to look for him ; but the other unkind squirrels drove her away.
She wandered all over the wood , calling -- `` person_0 ! person_0 ! Oh , where is person_0 ?"
IN the meantime person_0 came to his senses.
He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed , very much in the dark , feeling sore ; it seemed to be under ground.
person_0 coughed and groaned , because his ribs hurted him.
THE Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree -- `` Besides , I found a few buried !"
It laughed and chuckled when it heard person_0 's story.
`` Just another nut -- or two nuts ; let me crack them for you ,"
said the Chipmunk.
person_0 grew fatter and fatter ! NOW Goody person_1 had set to work again by herself.
She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker 's hole , because she had always doubted how they could be got out again.
She hid them under a tree root ; they rattled down , down , down.
What is the explanation of these showers of nuts ?"
`` I am sure I beg your pardon ; I did not not know that anybody lived here ,"
said Mrs.
Goody person_1 ; `` but where is Chippy Hackee ? My husband , person_0 , has run away too"
`` I know where Chippy is ; a little bird told me ,"
said Mrs.
Chippy Hackee.
SHE led the way to the woodpecker 's tree , and they listened at the hole.
`` You could squeeze in , through that little round hole ,"
said Goody person_1.
`` Yes , I could ,"
said the Chipmunk , `` but my husband , Chippy Hackee , bites !"
THEN Goody peeped in at the hole , and called down -- `` person_0 ! Oh fie , person_0 !"
And person_0 replied , `` Is that you , Goody person_1 ? Why , certainly !"
He came up and kissed Goody through the hole ; but he was so fat that he could not get out.
Chippy Hackee was not too fat , but he did not want to come ; he stayed down below and chuckled.
Then person_0 came out , and went home with an umbrella.
BUT Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week , although it was uncomfortable.
AT last a large bear came walking through the wood.
Perhaps he also was looking for nuts ; he seemed to be sniffing around.
And now person_0 and Goody person_1 keep their nut-store fastened up with a little padlock.
AND whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks , he sings -- `` Who 's - been - digging-up MY-nuts ? Who 's been digging-up MY-nuts ?"
But nobody ever answers ! The End"
ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits , and their names were -- Flopsy , Mopsy , Cotton-tail , and person_1.
They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank , underneath the root of a very big fir tree.
`` NOW , my dears ,"
said old Mrs.
Rabbit one morning , `` you may go into the fields or down the lane , but do n't go into Mr.
Mcperson_0 's garden : your Father had an accident there ; he was put in a pie by Mrs.
Mcperson_0"
`` NOW run along , and do n't get into mischief.
I am going out"
THEN old Mrs.
Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella , to the baker 's.
She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
BUT round the end of a cucumber frame , whom should he meet but Mr.
Mcperson_0 ! MR.
PETER was most dreadfully frightened ; he rushed all over the garden , for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.
He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages , and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.
It was a blue jacket with brass buttons , quite new.
MR.
AND rushed into the toolshed , and jumped into a can.
It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in , if it had not had so much water in it.
MR.
McGREGOR was quite sure that person_1 was somewhere in the toolshed , perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot.
He began to turn them over carefully , looking under each.
Presently person_1 sneezed -- `` Kertyschoo !"
Mr.
Mcperson_0 was after him in no time , AND tried to put his foot upon person_1 , who jumped out of a window , upsetting three plants.
The window was too small for Mr.
Mcperson_0 , and he was tired of running after person_1.
He went back to his work.
PETER sat down to rest ; he was out of breath and trembling with fright , and he had not the least idea which way to go.
Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.
After a time he began to wander about , going lippity -- lippity -- not very fast , and looking all around.
HE found a door in a wall ; but it was locked , and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.
An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep , carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood.
person_1 asked her the way to the gate , but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer.
She only shook her head at him.
person_1 began to cry.
THEN he tried to find his way straight across the garden , but he became more and more puzzled.
Presently , he came to a pond where Mr.
Mcperson_0 filled his water-cans.
person_1 thought it best to go away without speaking to her ; he had heard about cats from his cousin , little Benjamin Bunny.
person_1 scuttered underneath the bushes.
But presently , as nothing happened , he came out , and climbed upon a wheelbarrow , and peeped over.
The first thing he saw was Mr.
Mcperson_0 hoeing onions.
Mr.
Mcperson_0 caught sight of him at the corner , but person_1 did not care.
He slipped underneath the gate , and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.
MR.
McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.
PETER never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.
He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole , and shut his eyes.
His mother was busy cooking ; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.
BUT Flopsy , Mopsy , and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries , for supper.
The End"
IT belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane ; at least it belonged to Lucinda , but she never ordered meals.
Jane was the Cook ; but she never did any cooking , because the dinner had been bought ready-made , in a box full of shavings.
THERE were two red lobsters , and a ham , a fish , a pudding , and some pears and oranges.
They would not come off the plates , but they were extremely beautiful.
ONE morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll 's perambulator.
There was no one in the nursery , and it was very quiet.
Presently there was a little scuffling , scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace , where there was a hole under the skirting-board.
Tom person_0 put out his head for a moment , and then popped it in again.
Tom person_0 was a mouse.
THE doll 's house stood at the other side of the fireplace.
Tom person_0 and Hunca person_1 went cautiously across the hearth-rug.
They pushed the front door -- it was not fast.
TOM THUMB and Hunca person_1 went up-stairs and peeped into the dining - room.
It was a beautiful shiny yellow , streaked with red.
The knife crumpled up and hurt him ; he put his finger in his mouth.
`` It is not boiled enough ; it is hard.
You have a try , Hunca person_1"
HUNCA MUNCA stood up in her chair , and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.
`` It 's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger 's ,"
said Hunca person_1.
THE ham broke off the plate with a jerk , and rolled under the table.
`` Let it alone ,"
said Tom person_0 ; `` give me some fish , Hunca person_1 !"
HUNCA MUNCA tried every tin spoon in turn ; the fish was glued to the dish.
Then Tom person_0 lost his temper.
They broke up the pudding , the lobsters , the pears , and the oranges.
TOM THUMB went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top -- there was no soot.
WHILE Tom person_0 was up the chimney , Hunca person_1 had another disappointment.
She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser , labeled `` Rice ,"
`` Coffee"
`` Sago"
; but when she turned them upside down there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.
But Hunca person_1 had a frugal mind.
After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda 's bolster , she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather-bed.
WITH Tom person_0 's assistance she carried the bolster down-stairs and across the hearth-rug.
It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-hole ; but they managed it somehow.
THEN Hunca person_1 went back and fetched a chair , a bookcase , a bird-cage , and several small odds and ends.
The bookcase and the bird-cage refused to go into the mouse-hole.
HUNCA MUNCA left them behind the coal - box , and went to fetch a cradle.
HUNCA MUNCA was just returning with another chair , when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing.
The mice rushed back to their hole , and the dolls came into the nursery.
THE bookcase and the bird - cage were rescued from under the coal-box ; but Hunca person_1 has got the cradle and some of Lucinda 's clothes.
SHE also has some useful pots and pans , and several other things.
THE little girl that the doll 's house belonged to said : `` I will get a doll dressed like a policeman !"
BUT the nurse said : `` I will set a mouse-trap !"
SO that is the story of the two Bad Mice.
But they were not so very , very naughty after all , because Tom person_0 paid for everything he broke.
AND very early every morning -- before anybody is awake -- Hunca person_1 comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies ' house ! The End"
Great ships had been sent up towards the North Pole , to explore the most distant coasts , and to try how far men might penetrate up yonder.
For many many weeks there would now be a long night.
-- others only containing room enough to hold two or four men.
Every night the sacred volume rested beneath his head , and he knew from his childish years what was written in it.
That very morning the letter had arrived from the cold regions of the North -- there where the grandson was resting in the hand of God.
And the sound of a beauteous hymn welled up all around ; and the angel spread his wings like a veil over the sleeping youth.
God was with him ; and he carried home about with him in his heart , even in the uttermost parts of the sea"
The Lord had commanded him to let no one in during his absence , so Peter stood by the door and kept watch.
Before long some one knocked.
Peter asked who was there , and what he wanted ? `` I am a poor , honest tailor who prays for admission ,"
replied a smooth voice.
`` Honest indeed ,"
said Peter , `` like the thief on the gallows ! Thou hast been light-fingered and hast snipped folks ' clothes away.
Thou wilt not get into heaven.
The Lord hath forbidden me to let any one in while he is out"
`` Come , do be merciful ,"
cried the tailor.
`` Little scraps which fall off the table of their own accord are not stolen , and are not worth speaking about.
Look , I am lame , and have blisters on my feet with walking here , I can not possibly turn back again.
Only let me in , and I will do all the rough work.
Saint Peter let himself be moved by pity , and opened the door of heaven just wide enough for the lame tailor to slip his lean body in.
The tailor stood still , and looked at the seat for a long time , for it pleased him better than all else.
At last he could master his curiosity no longer , and climbed up and seated himself in the chair.
He asked Saint Peter what had become of the stool , but he did not know.
Then he asked if he had let anyone come in.
`` I know of no one who has been here ,"
answered Peter , `` but a lame tailor , who is still sitting behind the door"
answered the tailor joyously , `` I threw it in my anger down to earth at an old woman whom I saw stealing two veils at the washing"
`` Oh , thou knave ,"
Henceforth thou canst stay no longer in heaven , but must go outside the door again.
Then go where thou wilt.
No one shall give punishment here , but I alone , the Lord"
where the good soldiers sit and make merry"
Close beside it is the sea , the ever-changing sea , and between the two is placed the broad high-road.
One carriage after another rolls over it ; but I did not follow them , for my eye loves best to rest upon one point.
A Hun 's Grave -LRB- 2aaaaa -RRB- aaa lies there , and the sloe and blackthorn grow luxuriantly among the stones.
Here is true poetry in nature.
-LRB- Footnote 2 : Large mounds similar to the `` barrows"
found in Britain , are thus designated in Germany and the North.
`` First , two rich landed proprietors came driving by.
` Those are glorious trees ! ' said the first.
` The road here is wretched , ' observed another man who drove past.
The stage coach went rattling past.
All the passengers were asleep at this beautiful spot.
The postillion blew his horn , but he only thought , ` I can play capitally.
It sounds well here.
I wonder if those in there like it ? ' -- and the stage coach vanished.
Then two young fellows came gallopping up on horseback.
` I should not dislike a walk here with the miller 's Christine , ' said one -- and they flew past.
A carriage rolled by.
Six people were sitting in it.
` No , ' replied the coachman , ` it 's only a heap of stones ; but the trees are remarkable.
' ` How so ? ' ` Why , I 'll tell you how they are very remarkable.
I steer by them , so as not to drive into the sea ; and you see that is why the trees are remarkable.
' `` Now came a painter.
He spoke not a word , but his eyes sparkled.
He began to whistle.
At this the nightingales sang louder than ever.
` That will make a beautiful picture , ' he said.
He took it in just as a mirror takes in a view ; and as he worked he whistled a march of Rossini.
And last of all came a poor girl.
She laid aside the burden she carried , and sat down to rest upon the Hun 's Grave.
Her pale handsome face was bent in a listening attitude towards the forest.
My rays followed her till the morning dawn kissed her brow"
The air was clear again.
Several evenings had passed , and the Moon was in the first quarter.
Again he gave me an outline for a sketch.
Listen to what he told me.
`` I have followed the polar bird and the swimming whale to the eastern coast of Greenland.
Gaunt ice-covered rocks and dark clouds hung over a valley , where dwarf willows and barberry bushes stood clothed in green.
The blooming lychnis exhaled sweet odours.
My light was faint , my face pale as the water lily that , torn from its stem , has been drifting for weeks with the tide.
The crown-shaped Northern Light burned fiercely in the sky.
_ ' And in their white furs they danced about in the circle , till you might fancy it was a polar bear 's ball.
`` And now a Court of Judgment was opened.
The defendant replied with satire as keen , while the audience laughed , and gave their verdict.
A hundred paces away , under the open tent of hides , lay a sick man.
Or wouldst thou rather be buried in the sea ? ' ` In the sea , ' he whispered , and nodded with a mournful smile.
` Yes , it is a pleasant summer tent , the sea , ' observed the wife.
For his monument , he had the floating , ever-changing icebergs , whereon the seal sleeps , while the storm bird flies round their gleaming summits !"
nose went sniffle , sniffle , snuffle , and her eyes went twinkle , twinkle ; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.
`` THERE 'S one of my pocket-handkins !"
cried person_0 -- `` and there 's my pinny !"
person_1.
Tiggy-winkle ironed it , and goffered it , and shook out the frills.
`` Oh that IS lovely !"
said person_0.
`` AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves ?"
said person_1.
Tiggy - winkle.
`` WHY , there 's another handkersniff -- but it is n't mine ; it 's red ?"
`` Oh no , if you please 'm ; that one belongs to old person_1.
Rabbit ; and it DID so smell of onions ! I 've had to wash it separately , I ca n't get out the smell"
`` There 's another one of mine ,"
said person_0.
`` WHAT are those funny little white things ?"
`` That 's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten ; I only have to iron them ; she washes them herself"
`` There 's my last pocket - handkin !"
said person_0.
`` AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch ?"
`` They 're little dicky shirt - fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse -- most terrible particular !"
said person_1.
Tiggy-winkle.
`` Now I 've finished my ironing ; I 'm going to air some clothes"
`` WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things ?"
said person_0.
`` Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl"
`` Will their jackets take off ?"
asked Lucy.
`` Oh yes , if you please 'm ; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder.
And here 's one marked for Gatesgarth , and three that come from Little-town.
They 're ALWAYS marked at washing !"
said person_1.
Tiggy - winkle.
Tiggy-winkle made tea -- a cup for herself and a cup for person_0.
They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
person_1.
And then they made up the fire with turf , and came out and locked the door , and hid the key under the door-sill.
THEN away down the hill trotted person_0 and person_1.
Tiggy-winkle.
SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile , there was nothing left to carry except person_0 's one little bundle.
LUCIE scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand ; and then she turned to say `` Good-night ,"
and to thank the washer-woman -- But what a VERY odd thing ! person_1.
Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG.
Tiggy-winkle ! -RRB-"
IT is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is `` soporific"
_ I _ have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces ; but then _ I _ am not a rabbit.
They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the person_0 Bunnies ! WHEN Benjamin Bunny grew up , he married his Cousin person_0.
They had a large family , and they were very improvident and cheerful.
I do not remember the separate names of their children ; they were generally called the `` person_0 Bunnies"
SOMETIMES Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.
WHEN this happened , the person_0 Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap , in the ditch outside person_2.
Mcperson_1 's garden.
MR.
McGREGOR 'S rubbish heap was a mixture.
One day -- oh joy ! -- there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces , which had `` shot"
into flower.
THE person_0 Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces.
By degrees , one after another , they were overcome with slumber , and lay down in the mown grass.
Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children.
Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.
THE little person_0 Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun.
From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine.
The blue - bottles buzzed about the wall , and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.
-LRB- I can tell you her name , she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse , a woodmouse with a long tail.
-RRB- SHE rustled across the paper bag , and awakened Benjamin Bunny.
The mouse apologized profusely , and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.
WHILE she and Benjamin were talking , close under the wall , they heard a heavy tread above their heads ; and suddenly person_2.
Mcperson_1 emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping person_0 Bunnies ! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag.
The mouse hid in a jam pot.
THE little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass ; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.
They dreamt that their mother person_0 was tucking them up in a hay bed.
person_2.
Mcperson_1 looked down after emptying his sack.
He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings.
He stared at them for some time.
PRESENTLY a fly settled on one of them and it moved.
person_2.
Mcperson_1 climbed down on to the rubbish heap -- `` One , two , three , four ! five ! six leetle rabbits !"
said he as he dropped them into his sack.
The person_0 Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed.
They stirred a little in their sleep , but still they did not wake up.
MR.
McGREGOR tied up the sack and left it on the wall.
He went to put away the mowing machine.
WHILE he was gone , person_2s.
person_0 Bunny -LRB- who had remained at home -RRB- came across the field.
Benjamin and person_0 were in despair , they could not undo the string.
But person_2s.
Tittlemouse was a resourceful person.
She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.
THE little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.
Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows , an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.
THEN they all hid under a bush and watched for person_2.
Mcperson_1.
MR.
McGREGOR came back and picked up the sack , and carried it off.
He carried it hanging down , as if it were rather heavy.
The person_0 Bunnies followed at a safe distance.
THEY watched him go into his house.
And then they crept up to the window to listen.
MR.
They could hear him drag his chair on the flags , and chuckle -- `` One , two , three , four , five , six leetle rabbits !"
said person_2.
Mcperson_1.
`` EH ? What 's that ? What have they been spoiling now ?"
enquired person_2s.
Mcperson_1.
`` One , two , three , four , five , six leetle fat rabbits !"
repeated person_2.
Mcperson_1 , counting on his fingers -- `` one , two , three --"
`` Do n't you be silly ; what do you mean , you silly old man ?"
`` In the sack ! one , two , three , four , five , six !"
replied person_2.
Mcperson_1.
-LRB- The youngest person_0 Bunny got upon the window-sill.
-RRB- MRS.
McGREGOR took hold of the sack and felt it.
She said she could feel six , but they must be OLD rabbits , because they were so hard and all different shapes.
`` Not fit to eat ; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak"
`` Line your old cloak ?"
shouted person_2.
Mcperson_1 -- `` I shall sell them and buy myself baccy !"
`` Rabbit tobacco ! I shall skin them and cut off their heads"
MRS.
McGREGOR untied the sack and put her hand inside.
When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry.
She said that person_2.
Mcperson_1 had `` done it a purpose"
AND person_2.
Mcperson_1 was very angry too.
One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window , and hit the youngest person_0 Bunny.
It was rather hurt.
THEN Benjamin and person_0 thought that it was time to go home.
SO person_2.
Mcperson_1 did not get his tobacco , and person_2s.
Mcperson_1 did not get her rabbit skins.
The End"
This passion never , we perceive , remains In want from paucity of scheming brains.
The god of hearts so well exerts his force , That he receives his dues as things of course.
THE husband , as he entered , loudly cried , I 've sold our bucking-tub.
No pleasure ever yet received have I ; But take my word , to get it now I 'll try.
Gallants are plenty ; husbands should have wives ; That , like themselves , lead gay or sober lives.
THE reader wo n't require to know the rest ; What passed perhaps may easily be guessed.
` Tis quite enough , my thesis I have proved ; The artful trick our pair with raptures moved.
Nor one nor t ` other was a ` prentice new ; A lover be : -- and wiles you 'll soon pursue"
One evening the man came home in a very bad temper and told his wife to send for the butcher the next morning.
The wife was very bewildered and asked her husband : `` Why do you wish me to send for the butcher ?"
`` It 's no use taking that monkey round any longer , he 's too old and forgets his tricks.
I beat him with my stick all I know how , but he wo n't dance properly.
I must now sell him to the butcher and make what money out of him I can.
There is nothing else to be done"
Now the monkey was in the next room and overheard ever word of the conversation.
Ah ! a bright thought has struck me ! There is , I know , a wild bear living in the forest near by.
I have often heard tell of his wisdom.
Perhaps if I go to him and tell him the strait I am in he will give me his counsel.
I will go and try"
There was no time to lose.
The monkey slipped out of the house and ran as quickly as he could to the forest to find the boar.
The boar was at home , and the monkey began his tale of woe at once.
`` Good Mr.
Boar , I have heard of your excellent wisdom.
I am in great trouble , you alone can help me.
I have grown old in the service of my master , and because I can not dance properly now he intends to sell me to the butcher.
What do you advise me to do ? I know how clever you are !"
The boar was pleased at the flattery and determined to help the monkey.
He thought for a little while and then said : `` Has n't your master a baby ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the monkey , `` he has one infant son"
`` What then ?"
said the monkey.
The monkey thanked the boar many times and then went home.
He did not sleep much that night , as you may imagine , for thinking of the morrow.
His life depended on whether the boar 's plan succeeded or not.
He was the first up , waiting anxiously for what was to happen.
Then all happened as the boar had planned.
The mother placed her child near the porch as usual while she tidied up the house and got her breakfast ready.
The child was crooning happily in the morning sunlight , dabbing on the mats at the play of light and shadow.
Suddenly there was a noise in the porch and a loud cry from the child.
She flung out her hands with a loud cry of despair and rushed into the inner room where her husband was still sleeping soundly.
He sat up slowly and rubbed his eyes , and crossly demanded what his wife was making all that noise about.
`` There !"
said the wife.
`` This is the animal you want to kill -- if the monkey had n't been here we should have lost our child forever"
`` You are right , wife , for once ,"
said the man as he carried the child into the house.
`` You may send the butcher back when he comes , and now give us all a good breakfast and the monkey too"
Charles Dickens once told us about a pig , and since that time we are in a good humor if we only hear one grunt.
St.
The farmer had his pig-sty built out towards the high road , close by his house , and it was a wonderful pig-sty.
It was an old state carriage.
`` Humph ! humph !"
said the occupants , and the coach creaked and groaned ; for it had come to a mournful end.
`` The beautiful has departed ,"
it sighed -- or at least it might have done so.
We came back in autumn.
The coach was there still , but the pigs were gone.
They were playing the grand lords out in the woods.
`` The beautiful has departed ! This was the glorious green wood , but the song of the birds and the warm sunshine are gone ! gone !"
Do you know him ? He is all beard , the finest reddish-green beard ; he is easily recognized.
A little green leaf grows up out of his head , and that 's his feather.
He is the only man of his kind on the rose bush ; and he it was who sighed.
-LRB- Illustration : THE PIGS AT HOME IN THE OLD STATE COACH.
Raven and crow sat on the high bough ; and they had a large family , who all said , `` Good ! good !"
and the majority is always right.
Under the high trees , in the hollow , was a great puddle , and here the pigs reclined , great and small.
They found the place so inexpressibly lovely ! `` Oui ! oui !"
they all exclaimed.
The old ones put their heads together.
`` Umph !"
`` Oui ! oui !"
chimed in all the rest.
But the mother now looked at her little porker , the one with the ring in his tail , `` One must not overlook the beautiful ,"
she said.
`` Good ! good !"
`` Gone ! gone !"
sighed the rose king.
`` All the beautiful is gone !"
It was boisterous , it was gray , cold , and windy ; and through the forest and over the field swept the rain in long dark streaks.
It was lit up like a star , and threw its long ray among the trees.
A song sounded forth out of the house ! Beautiful children played there round the old grandfather.
But the rose king heard it not , for he sat in the cold , damp weather , and sighed , `` Gone ! gone !"
And the pigs were the lords of the forest , and the old mother sow looked proudly at her little porker with the twist in his tail.
`` There is always somebody who has a soul for the beautiful !"
she said"
In a little provincial town , in the time of the year when people say `` the evenings are drawing in ,"
there was one evening quite a social gathering in the home of a father of a family.
The weather was still mild and warm.
But they were not talking about this.
It was , in fact , an old gravestone.
`` Yes ,"
-LRB- Illustration : PREBEN SCHWANE AND HIS WIFE MARTHA.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` One can very well see that it is a gravestone ,"
But nothing more can be distinguished , and even that is only plain when it has been raining , or when we have washed the stone.
`` On my word , that must be the gravestone of Preben Schwane and his wife !"
These words were spoken by an old man ; so old , that he might well have been the grandfather of all who were present in the room.
`` Yes , they were one of the last pairs that were buried in the old churchyard of the convent.
They were an honest old couple.
I can remember them from the days of my boyhood.
Every one knew them , and every one esteemed them.
They were the oldest pair here in the town.
They were very kind to the poor ; they fed them and clothed them ; and there was judgment in their benevolence and true Christianity.
The old woman died first : that day is still quite clear before my mind.
I was a little boy , and had accompanied my father over there , and we were just there when she fell asleep.
The old man was very much moved , and wept like a child.
And then he talked of the wedding-day , and his eyes gleamed ; he seemed to talk himself back into that time of joy.
Time passes away , and all things change.
I can very well remember the day when she was buried , and how Preben Schwane walked close behind the coffin.
The high-road now goes over the resting-place of old Preben and his wife.
No one thinks of them any more"
And the old man who had told all this shook his head scornfully.
`` Forgotten ! Everything will be forgotten !"
he said.
`` Forgotten ! Everything will be forgotten !"
was repeated in the room.
The seed-corn of this hour shall ripen in the course of time to a blooming poem.
The beautiful and the good shall not be forgotten ; it shall live on in legend and in song"
EAST INDIA was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until he had received six hundred dollars.
Then the townsfolk caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum that whosoever was able to procure the money should be burgomaster.
So the father went and gave them to the great men of the town , and the enemy departed , and the fisherman became burgomaster.
Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say , `` Mr.
Burgomaster ,"
should be put to death on the gallows.
The son got away again from the enemy , and came to a great forest on a high mountain.
The mountain opened , and he went into a great enchanted castle , wherein chairs , tables , and benches were all hung with black.
He said he would gladly do that , if he did but know how.
When he had been there for a long while he said he should like to go to his father , and they told him he might go.
He was to take with him this purse with money , put on this coat , and in a week he must be back there again.
Then he was caught up , and was instantly in East India.
Then he went to his father and said , `` Fisherman , how hast thou got here ?"
Then the father said , `` Thou must not say that , if the great men of the town knew of that , thou wouldst come to the gallows"
He , however , would not stop , and was brought to the gallows.
When he was there , he said , `` O , my masters , just give me leave to go to the old fisherman 's hut"
And they had told him not to fear , and that he could deliver them.
Anne she fancied she had only half a soul , and that her child had taken the other half down into the sea.
Many a night she was missed from her home ; and she was always found on the sea shore , waiting for the spectre.
Her physical forces were almost exhausted , but her eyes gleamed brightly , and her cheeks had a rosy flush.
That was just a chance , the people said ; as many things happen by chance.
In the face of Anne Lisbeth , illumined by the sun , peace and rest were to be seen.
She said she was happy , for now she had conquered.
And then he gave her her lost soul back again , and brought her here into the church.
`` Now I am in the house of God ,"
she said , `` and in that house we are happy"
Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister.
The brothers were married , but their wives did not do the cooking for the family.
It was done by their sister , who stopped at home to cook.
In this way she will be delayed.
Let the water not flow into her pitcher , and you may keep the maiden as your own"
At noon when she went to bring water , it suddenly dried up before her , and she began to weep.
Then after a while the water began slowly to rise.
When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher , but it would not go under the water.
The pitcher filled with water , and along with it she sank and was drowned.
The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself , and carried her off.
After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of the tank in which she had been drowned.
When he lifted his axe to cut high up the stem , the bamboo cried out , `` Do not cut near the top , cut at the root"
and when he was about to cut higher up , it again called out to him , `` Do not cut high up , cut at the root"
The instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it.
Some of them were moved even to tears , for the fiddle seemed to wail as one in bitter anguish.
The Jogi , however , knew its value , and refused to sell it.
When they saw that he was not to be prevailed upon , they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor.
Of the latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated.
While he was in this condition , they took away his fiddle , and substituted their own old one for it.
When the Jogi recovered , he missed his instrument , and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to return it to him.
They denied having taken it , so he had to depart , leaving his fiddle behind him.
The young chief , however , was determined to watch , and see which of his girl friends was so attentive to his comfort.
So saying , he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood.
In a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle , and began to dress her hair.
He said , `` No.
.
But from to-day , you and I are one"
So they began lovingly to hold converse with each other.
When the others returned home in the evening , they saw that she was both a human being and a Bonga , and they rejoiced exceedingly.
The Bonga girl recognized them at once , but they did not know who she was.
She brought them water on their arrival , and afterwards set cooked rice before them.
Then sitting down near them , she began in wailing tones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been subjected to by their wives.
And that was all the revenge she took"
He was astounded , and knew not what to say to it.
They did not stop until all was done , and stood finished on the table , and they ran quickly away.
Next morning the woman said , `` The little men have made us rich , and we really must show that we are grateful for it.
They run about so , and have nothing on , and must be cold.
The man said , `` I shall be very glad to do it ;"
Then they danced and skipped and leapt over chairs and benches.
At last they danced out of doors.
From that time forth they came no more , but as long as the shoemaker lived all went well with him , and all his undertakings prospered.
Then three elves came and conducted her to a hollow mountain , where the little folks lived.
Everything there was small , but more elegant and beautiful than can be described.
The girl stood as godmother , and then wanted to go home again , but the little elves urgently entreated her to stay three days with them.
So she stayed , and passed the time in pleasure and gaiety , and the little folks did all they could to make her happy.
At last she set out on her way home.
Then first they filled her pockets quite full of money , and after that they led her out of the mountain again.
In her trouble she went to her neighbor , and asked her advice.
The woman did everything that her neighbor bade her.
And he began to laugh at it.
`` I saw a little girl weeping ,"
said the Moon ; `` she was weeping over the depravity of the world.
She had received a most beautiful doll as a present.
Oh , that was a glorious doll , so fair and delicate ! She did not seem created for the sorrows of this world.
`` The little girl could not reach up to the doll , and could not help her down , and that is why she was crying.
The doll must certainly have been crying too ; for she stretched out her arms among the green branches , and looked quite mournful.
Yes , these are the troubles of life of which the little girl had often heard tell.
` I 'll stay with you , ' she said , although she felt anything but happy in her mind.
I wonder if I have done anything wrong ? ' And she considered.
' And she looked up at the doll.
` Did you laugh at the duck too ? ' she asked ; and it seemed as if the doll shook her head"
`` For heaven 's sake just go in peace ,"
answered the woman , `` I will manage that"
`` You , indeed ,"
said the man.
And having said that , the man went on his way.
Next morning the cattle-dealer came , and the woman had no need to say many words to him.
I will take the beasts away with me at once"
`` True ,"
answered the man , `` but I have forgotten to buckle on my money-belt.
Have no fear , however , you shall have security for my paying.
I will take two cows with me and leave one , and then you will have a good pledge"
answered the woman , `` and as you said , for two hundred thalers.
They are scarcely worth so much , but the man took them without making any objection"
`` Where is the money ?"
asked the peasant.
`` Oh , I have not got the money ,"
replied the woman ; `` he had happened to forget his money-belt , but he will soon bring it , and he left good security behind him"
`` What kind of security ?"
asked the man.
`` One of the three cows , which he shall not have until he has paid for the other two.
I have managed very cunningly , for I have kept the smallest , which eats the least"
The man was enraged and lifted up his stick , and was just going to give her the beating he had promised her.
I will go out into the highways and wait for three days to see if I find anyone who is still stupider than you.
If I succeed in doing so , you shall go scot-free , but if I do not find him , you shall receive your well-deserved reward without any discount"
He went out into the great highways , sat down on a stone , and waited for what would happen.
The man thought to himself , `` That is certainly one of the kind I am in search of ,"
and jumped up and ran backwards and forwards in front of the waggon like one who is not very wise.
`` What do you want , my friend ?"
said the woman to him ; `` I do n't know you , where do you come from ?"
`` I have fallen down from heaven ,"
replied the man , `` and do n't know how to get back again , could n't you drive me up ?"
`` No ,"
You must have seen him ?"
`` Oh , yes , I have seen him , but all men ca n't get on well.
He keeps sheep , and the sheep give him a great deal to do.
They run up the mountains and lose their way in the wilderness , and he has to run after them and drive them together again.
His clothes are all torn to pieces too , and will soon fall off his body.
There is no tailor there , for Saint Peter wo n't let any of them in , as you know by the story"
`` Who would have thought it ?"
You will be so kind as to take it with you"
`` That wo n't do very well ,"
answered the peasant ; `` people are not allowed to take clothes into Heaven , they are taken away from one at the gate"
`` Then hark you ,"
said the woman , `` I sold my fine wheat yesterday and got a good lot of money for it , I will send that to him.
If you hide the purse in your pocket , no one will know that you have it"
`` If you ca n't manage it any other way ,"
said the peasant , `` I will do you that favor"
`` Just sit still where you are ,"
said she , `` and I will drive home and fetch the purse , I shall soon be back again.
I do not sit down on the bundle of straw , but stand up in the waggon , because it makes it lighter for the cattle"
It was not long before she came in a great hurry with the money , and with her own hands put it in his pocket.
Before she went away , she thanked him again a thousand times for his courtesy.
When the woman got home again , she found her son who had come in from the field.
Who would ever have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything up in heaven ?"
The son was full of astonishment.
`` Mother ,"
He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed.
He found the peasant who was sitting under a willow-tree , and was just going to count the money in the purse.
`` Have you seen the man who has fallen down from Heaven ?"
cried the youth to him.
`` Yes ,"
`` Alas ,"
`` Aha !"
thought the peasant , `` here is another who has no wick in his lamp !"
`` Why should I not do you this favor ?"
said he , and mounted the horse and rode off in a quick trot.
The youth remained sitting there till night fell , but the peasant never came back.
`` The man from Heaven must certainly have been in a great hurry , and would not turn back ,"
thought he , `` and the peasant has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father"
`` Thou hast done well ,"
answered she , `` thy legs are younger than his , and thou canst go on foot"
If stupidity always brought in as much as that , I would be quite willing to hold it in honor"
So thought the peasant , but you no doubt prefer the simple folks"
THERE was a poor but good little girl who lived alone with her mother , and they no longer had anything to eat.
would cook good , sweet porridge , and when she said , `` Stop , little pot ,"
it ceased to cook.
Once on a time when the girl had gone out , her mother said , `` Cook , little pot , cook"
And it did cook and she ate till she was satisfied , and then she wanted the pot to stop cooking , but did not know the word.
At last when only one single house remained , the child came home and just said , `` Stop , little pot ,"
and it stopped and gave up cooking , and whosoever wished to return to the town had to eat his way back"
When the father heard that , he said , `` Thou hast carried it the farthest , and shalt be King"
He spoke to her , and said , `` Dear child , can I and my servant find shelter for the night in the little house ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the girl in a sad voice , `` that you certainly can , but I do not advise you to venture it.
Do not go in"
`` Why not ?"
asked the King 's son.
The maiden sighed and said , `` My step-mother practises wicked arts ; she is ill-disposed toward strangers"
The old woman was sitting in an armchair by the fire , and looked at the stranger with her red eyes.
`` Good evening ,"
growled she , and pretended to be quite friendly.
`` Take a seat and rest yourselves"
She blew up the fire on which she was cooking something in a small pot.
The daughter warned the two to be prudent , to eat nothing , and drink nothing , for the old woman brewed evil drinks.
They slept quietly until early morning.
`` Take that to your master ,"
said she.
But at that instant the glass broke and the poison spirted on the horse , and it was so strong that the animal immediately fell down dead.
When , however , he came to the dead horse a raven was already sitting on it devouring it.
`` Who knows whether we shall find anything better to-day ?"
said the servant ; so he killed the raven , and took it with him.
And now they journeyed onwards into the forest the whole day , but could not get out of it.
By nightfall they found an inn and entered it.
The servant gave the raven to the innkeeper to make ready for supper.
She opened all doors to the stranger and showed him the heaped-up treasures.
But the King 's son said she might keep everything , he would have none of it , and rode onwards with his servant.
Then he went to her and laid his riddle before her.
`` What is this ?"
said he , `` One slew none , and yet slew twelve"
Now the master believed himself safe for the third night , and lay down in his own bed.
Then came the princess herself , and she had put on a misty-grey mantle , and she seated herself near him.
Then she asked , `` One slew none , what is that ?"
He replied , `` A raven , which ate of a dead and poisoned horse , and died of it"
She inquired further , `` And yet slew twelve , what is that ?"
He answered , `` That means twelve murderers , who ate the raven and died of it"
Next morning , the King 's daughter announced that she had guessed the riddle , and sent for the twelve judges and expounded it before them.
The judges said , `` Bring us a proof of this"
There was once a peasant who had driven his cow to the fair , and sold her for seven thalers.
On the way home he had to pass a pond , and already from afar he heard the frogs crying , `` Aik , aik , aik , aik"
`` Well ,"
said he to himself , `` they are talking without rhyme or reason , it is seven that I have received , not eight"
The frogs , however , stood to their , `` aik aik , aik , aik"
`` Come , then , if you wo n't believe it , I can count it out to you"
And he took his money out of his pocket and counted out the seven thalers , always reckoning four and twenty groschen to a thaler.
The frogs , however , paid no attention to his reckoning , but still cried , `` aik , aik , aik , aik"
`` What ,"
cried the peasant , quite angry , `` since you are determined to know better than I , count it yourselves ,"
and threw all the money into the water to them.
and besides that , did not throw the money out again.
He still waited a long while until evening came on and he was forced to go home.
And with that he went away , but the frogs still cried , `` aik , aik , aik , aik ,"
after him till he went home quite angry.
The dog , however , answered nothing but `` wow , wow"
`` Wilt thou promise not to devour it all then , and wilt thou go bail for thy companions ?"
`` Wow , wow , wow ,"
said the dog.
Thereupon he unloaded the meat and turned back again , the dogs fell upon it and loudly barked , `` wow , wow"
When three days had passed , the countryman thought , `` To-night my money will be in my pocket ,"
and was quite delighted.
But no one would come and pay it.
`` There is no trusting any one now ,"
said he ; and at last he lost patience , and went into the town to the butcher and demanded his money.
Then the butcher grew angry , snatched a broomstick and drove him out.
`` Wait a while ,"
said the peasant , `` there is still some justice in the world !"
and went to the royal palace and begged for an audience.
He was led before the King , who sat there with his daughter , and asked him what injury he had suffered.
`` Alas !"
said he , `` the frogs and the dogs have taken from me what is mine , and the butcher has paid me for it with the stick ,"
and he related at full length all that had happened.
Thou mayst thank God for thy good fortune !"
`` Oh ,"
Then the King grew angry , and said , `` Thou art a boor"
`` Ah , Lord King ,"
replied the peasant , `` what can you expect from an ox , but beef ?"
`` Stop ,"
answered the King , `` thou shalt have another reward.
Be off now , but come back in three days , and then thou shalt have five hundred counted out in full"
`` Yes , that is what I think ,"
answered the peasant ; `` five hundred are to be counted out to me"
`` Hark thee ,"
said the soldier , `` give me some of it.
What canst thou do with all that money ?"
`` As it is thou ,"
said the peasant , `` thou shalt have two hundred ; present thyself in three days ' time before the King , and let it be paid to thee"
`` Jew ,"
The Jew was delighted with the profit , and brought the sum in bad groschen , three of which were worth two good ones.
After three days had passed , according to the King 's command , the peasant went before the King.
`` Pull his coat off ,"
said the latter , `` and he shall have his five hundred"
`` Ah !"
In the meantime the soldier and the Jew entered and claimed what they had gained from the peasant , and they received the blows strictly counted out.
The soldier bore it patiently and knew already how it tasted , but the Jew said sorrowfully , `` Alas , alas , are these the heavy thalers ?"
Go into my treasure chamber and get some money for thyself , as much as thou wilt"
The peasant did not need to be told twice , and stuffed into his big pockets whatsoever would go in.
Afterwards he went to an inn and counted out his money.
`` Good heavens !"
When the King heard of the peasant 's words he fell into a passion , and commanded the Jew to go and bring the offender to him.
The Jew ran to the peasant , `` You are to go at once to the lord King in the very clothes you have on"
`` I know what 's right better than that ,"
answered the peasant , `` I shall have a new coat made first.
Dost thou think that a man with so much money in his pocket is to go there in his ragged old coat ?"
What will people not do for love !"
The peasant was contented with this , put the Jew 's coat on , and went off with him.
The King reproached the countryman because of the evil speaking of which the Jew had informed him.
`` Ah ,"
`` What is that ?"
shrieked the Jew.
When the King heard that , he said , `` The Jew has assuredly deceived one or the other of us , either myself or the peasant ,"
and again he ordered something to be counted out to him in hard thalers.
There was once a man who had three sons , and nothing else in the world but the house in which he lived.
The sons were well content with this , and the eldest determined to be a blacksmith , the second a barber , and the third a fencing-master.
They fixed a time when they should all come home again , and then each went his way.
It chanced that they all found skilful masters , who taught them their trades well.
The blacksmith had to shoe the King 's horses , and he thought to himself , `` The house is mine , without doubt"
The barber only shaved great people , and he too already looked upon the house as his own.
The fencing-master got many a blow , but he only bit his lip , and let nothing vex him ; `` for ,"
said he to himself , `` If you are afraid of a blow , you 'll never win the house"
As they were sitting thus , all at once a hare came running across the field.
`` Ah , ha , just in time !"
said the barber.
`` Well done !"
said the old man.
`` Your brothers will have to exert themselves wonderfully , or the house will be yours"
Soon after , up came a nobleman in his coach , dashing along at full speed.
`` Now you shall see what I can do , father ,"
`` You are a fine fellow , and as clever as your brother ,"
said his father ; `` I do not know to which I ought to give the house"
Then the third son said , `` Father , let me have my turn , if you please ;"
When his father saw this he was amazed , and said , `` This is the master-piece , the house is yours !"
And because they had been so clever , and had loved one another so much , they were all laid in the same grave"
`` Yesterday ,"
began the Moon , `` I looked down upon the turmoil of Paris.
My eye penetrated into an apartment of the Louvre.
She folded her thin hands , and looked round with an air of reverence , as if she had been in a church"
` There , ' she exclaimed , ` there ! ' and she knelt and kissed the purple carpet.
I think she was actually weeping"
` But it was not _ this very _ velvet ! ' observed the footman , and a smile played about his mouth.
` True , but it was this very place , ' replied the woman , ` and it must have looked just like this.
' ` But for all that you can say , my grandson died upon the throne of person_0.
Died ! ' mournfully repeated the old woman.
I do not think another word was spoken , and they soon quitted the hall.
The evening twilight faded , and my light shone doubly vivid upon the rich velvet that covered the throne of person_0.
`` Now , who do you think this poor woman was ? Listen , I will tell you a story.
The people stormed the Tuileries.
Even women and children were to be found among the combatants.
They penetrated into the apartments and halls of the palace.
A poor half-grown boy in a ragged blouse fought among the older insurgents.
Mortally wounded with several bayonet thrusts , he sank down.
This happened in the throne-room.
They laid the bleeding youth upon the throne of person_0 , wrapped the velvet around his wounds , and his blood streamed forth upon the imperial purple.
It was more than a fortnight since the Moon had shone.
Now he stood once more , round and bright , above the clouds , moving slowly onward.
Hear what the Moon told me.
`` From a town in Fezzan I followed a caravan.
`` For many nights I followed the train.
My beams cooled the glowing sands , and showed them the black rocks , dead islands in the immense ocean of sand.
No hostile tribes met them in their pathless route , no storms arose , no columns of sand whirled destruction over the journeying caravan.
At home the beautiful wife prayed for her husband and her father.
` Are they dead ? ' she asked of my golden crescent ; ` Are they dead ? ' she cried to my full disc.
Now the desert lies behind them.
The luxuriant herbage is trampled down , crushed by the feet of elephants.
A negro leads a young lion which he has bought , by a string.
He raises his head , and --"
But at this moment a cloud passed before the Moon , and then another.
I heard nothing more from him this evening"
`` It is indeed a heavy burden ,"
How can one have any rest , or peace of one 's life ?"
He seated himself , collected his thoughts , and considered how he could set his shoulders free from this burden.
For a long time all thinking was to no purpose , but suddenly it was as if scales fell from his eyes.
`` I know what I will do ,"
The parents did not reflect long.
`` Birds of a feather , flock together ,"
they thought , and consented.
So fat Trina became Harry 's wife , and led out both the goats.
Harry had a good time of it , and had no work that he required to rest from but his own idleness.
But fat Trina was no less idle.
`` Dear Harry ,"
We will put the beehive in a sunny place behind the house , and trouble ourselves no more about it.
`` Thou hast spoken like a sensible woman ,"
replied Harry.
The neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats.
Lazy Harry did not like to leave his bed before noon.
`` He who rises early ,"
said he , `` wastes his substance"
`` But ,"
`` Dost thou think ,"
`` Oh ,"
Look , Harry ,"
She reached her arm out to strike , but unhappily hit the honey-pitcher above the bed.
The pitcher struck against the wall and fell down in fragments , and the fine honey streamed down on the ground.
`` There lie the goose and the young gosling ,"
said Harry , `` and want no looking after.
But it is lucky that the pitcher did not fall on my head.
We have all reason to be satisfied with our lot"
What matters if we do get up a little later the day is always long enough"
`` Yes ,"
answered Trina , `` we shall always get to the end of it at the proper time.
Dost thou know that the snail was once asked to a wedding and set out to go , but arrived at the christening.
In front of the house it fell over the fence , and said , ` Speed does no good.
'"
`` I am already aged ,"
Only seek out a country where such things are still unknown , and your fortune is made"
`` Look !"
But if it crows by broad daylight , then take notice , for there will certainly be a change of weather"
They asked if the creature were for sale , and how much he wanted for it ? `` About as much gold as an ass can carry ,"
answered he.
`` A ridiculously small price for such a precious creature !"
they cried unanimously , and willingly gave him what he had asked.
But it did not look as if he would , for labourers met him everywhere , and they had scythes upon their shoulders as well as he.
At last , however , he chanced upon an island where the people knew nothing of scythes.
When the corn was ripe there , they took cannon out to the fields and shot it down.
So the man set to work and mowed it down so quietly and quickly that the people opened their mouths with astonishment.
They agreed to give him what he wanted for the scythe , and he received a horse laden with as much gold as it could carry.
And now the third brother wanted to take his cat to the right man.
He fared just like the others ; so long as he stayed on the mainland there was nothing to be done.
Every place had cats , and there were so many of them that new-born kittens were generally drowned in the ponds.
The cat made herself merry with the mice in the royal palace , and killed so many that they could not be counted.
At last she grew warm with the work and thirsty , so she stood still , lifted up her head and cried , `` Mew.
Mew !"
When they heard this strange cry , the King and all his people were frightened , and in their terror ran all at once out of the palace.
A noble youth , therefore , was sent to ask the cat `` whether she would peaceably quit the castle ?"
But the cat , whose thirst had become still greater , merely answered , `` Mew ! Mew !"
The youth understood her to say , `` Most certainly not ! most certainly not !"
and took this answer to the King.
`` Then ,"
said the councillors , `` she shall yield to force"
Cannon were brought out , and the palace was soon in flames.
Lean Lisa was of a very different way of thinking from lazy Harry and fat Trina , who never let anything disturb their peace.
It was , however , all to no purpose , they had nothing and came to nothing.
This pleased the husband right well.
`` It is true ,"
I shall be glad ,"
he added , `` if the cow has a calf , and then I shall often get a drink of milk to refresh me"
`` The milk is not for thee ,"
said the woman , `` we must let the calf suck that it may become big and fat , and we may be able to sell it well"
`` Certainly ,"
replied the man , `` but still we will take a little milk ; that will do no harm"
`` Who has taught thee to manage cows ?"
`` Wife ,"
said the man , `` be quiet , or I will give thee a blow on thy mouth !"
`` What !"
cried she , `` thou threatenest me , thou glutton , thou rascal , thou lazy Harry !"
Bab -LRB- such her name , and daughter of a knight -RRB- Was airy , buxom : formed for am ` rous fight.
And wish for death , since all round went wrong.
Some easy moments he perhaps might get ; A full detail in hist ` ry 's page is met.
At the creation of the world , the light at night had been sufficient.
By means of this , everything could very well be seen and distinguished , even though it was not so brilliant as the sun.
The travellers stopped and asked a countryman who was driving past with his cart , what kind of a light that was.
`` That is the moon ,"
answered he ; `` our mayor bought it for three thalers , and fastened it to the oak-tree.
He has to pour oil into it daily , and to keep it clean , so that it may always burn clearly.
He receives a thaler a week from us for doing it"
What a pleasure it would be not to have to feel about at night in the darkness !"
`` I 'll tell you what we 'll do ,"
said the second ; `` we will fetch a cart and horses and carry away the moon.
The people here may buy themselves another"
`` I 'm a good climber ,"
said the third , `` I will bring it down"
When the shining ball lay in the cart , they covered it over with a cloth , that no one might observe the theft.
They conveyed it safely into their own country , and placed it on a high oak.
Old and young rejoiced , when the new lamp let its light shine over the whole land , and bed-rooms and sitting-rooms were filled with it.
The dwarfs came forth from their caves in the rocks , and the tiny elves in their little red coats danced in rings on the meadows.
When he died , the mayor climbed up the tree , and cut off a quarter with the hedge-shears , and this was placed in his coffin.
The light of the moon decreased , but still not visibly.
When the second died , the second quarter was buried with him , and the light diminished.
They rose up and were merry , and fell into their former ways of living.
The noise became greater and greater , and at last reached even to heaven.
As these , however , did not come , he got on his horse and rode through the gate of heaven , down into the world below.
Then the hen found a large , large nut , but said nothing about it , intending to eat the kernel herself.
Then she cried , `` Cock , I entreat thee to run as fast thou canst , and fetch me some water , or I shall choke"
The well answered , `` First run to the bride , and get her to give thee some red silk"
The bride answered , `` First run and bring me my little wreath which is hanging to a willow"
On the way , however , they met the fox , who said , `` Where art thou going , little cock ?"
`` I am going to bury my little hen"
`` May I drive with thee ?"
`` Yes , but seat thyself at the back of the carriage , for in the front my little horses could not drag thee"
Then the procession went onwards , and they reached the stream.
`` How are we to get over ?"
said the little cock.
A straw was lying by the stream , and it said , `` I will lay myself across , and you shall drive over me"
So the coal also laid itself across the water , but unhappily just touched it , on which the coal hissed , was extinguished and died.
When a stone saw that , it took pity on the little cock , wished to help him , and laid itself over the water.
she spoke to him in a friendly way.
`` Good-day , dear Mr.
Fox , how are you ? How is all with you ? How are you getting through this dear season ?"
`` I understand but one ,"
replied the cat , modestly.
`` What art is that ?"
asked the fox.
`` When the hounds are following me , I can spring into a tree and save myself"
`` Is that all ?"
said the fox.
`` I am master of a hundred arts , and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning.
Thou makest me sorry for thee ; come with me , I will teach thee how people get away from the hounds"
Just then came a hunter with four dogs.
The cat sprang nimbly up a tree , and sat down on top of it , where the branches and foliage quite concealed her.
`` Open your sack , Mr.
Fox , open your sack ,"
cried the cat to him , but the dogs had already seized him , and were holding him fast.
`` Ah , Mr.
Fox ,"
cried the cat.
`` You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch ! Had you been able to climb like me , you would not have lost your life"
The mother of Hans said , `` Whither away , Hans ?"
Hans answered , `` To Grethel"
`` Behave well , Hans"
`` Oh , I 'll behave well.

`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans comes to Grethel , `` Good day , Grethel"

What good thing dost thou bring ?"
`` I bring nothing , I want something given me"
Grethel presents Hans with a young goat.
`` Good-bye , Grethel"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans takes the goat , ties its legs , and puts it in his pocket.
When he gets home it is suffocated.
`` Good evening , mother"
`` Good evening , Hans.
Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` Took nothing , she gave me something"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` She gave me a goat"
`` Where is the goat , Hans ?"
`` Put it in my pocket"
`` That was ill done , Hans , thou shouldst have put a rope round the goat 's neck"
`` Never mind , will do better next time"
`` Whither away , Hans ?"
`` To Grethel , mother"

`` Good day , Hans.
What good thing dost thou bring ?"
`` I bring nothing , I want something given me"
Grethel presents Hans with a piece of bacon.
`` Good-bye , Grethel"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans takes the bacon , ties it to a rope , and drags it away behind him.
The dogs come and devour the bacon.
When he gets home , he has the rope in his hand , and there is no longer anything hanging to it.
`` Good evening , mother"
`` Good evening , Hans"
`` Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` I took her nothing , she gave me something"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` Gave me a bit of bacon"
`` Where is the bacon , Hans ?"
`` I tied it to a rope , brought it home , dogs took it"

Hans comes to Grethel.

`` Good day , Hans"
`` What good thing dost thou bring ?"
`` I bring nothing , but would have something given"
Grethel presents Hans with a calf.
`` Good-bye , Grethel"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans takes the calf , puts it on his head , and the calf kicks his face.
`` Good evening , mother"
`` Good evening , Hans.
Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` I took nothing , but had something given me"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` A calf"
`` Where hast thou the calf , Hans ?"
`` I set it on my head and it kicked my face"

Grethel says to Hans , `` I will go with thee"
Hans takes Grethel , ties her to a rope , leads her to the rack and binds her fast.
Then Hans goes to his mother.
`` Good evening , mother"
`` Good evening , Hans.
Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` I took her nothing"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` She gave me nothing , she came with me"
`` Where hast thou left Grethel ?"
`` I led her by the rope , tied her to the rack , and scattered some grass for her"
`` That was ill done , Hans , thou shouldst have cast friendly eyes on her"
`` Never mind , will do better"
Hans went into the stable , cut out all the calves ' and sheep 's eyes , and threw them in Grethel 's face.
Then Grethel became angry , tore herself loose and ran away , and became the bride of Hans"
`` I was gliding over the Lueneburg Heath ,"
the Moon said.
`` A lonely hut stood by the wayside , a few scanty bushes grew near it , and a nightingale who had lost his way sang sweetly.
He died in the coldness of the night : it was his farewell song that I heard.
`` The morning dawn came glimmering red.
They heard the dying nightingale sing : it was no false prophet , but a harbinger of fortune.
Thou must sell thyself , thy wife , and thy children.
But your griefs shall not last long.
Behind the broad fragrant leaves lurks the goddess of Death , and her welcome kiss shall breathe fever into thy blood.
Fare away , fare away , over the heaving billows.
' And the caravan listened well pleased to the song of the nightingale , which seemed to promise good fortune.
All around lay a wide dead plain , covered with faded brown heath , and black charred spaces between the white sand hills.
The women carried hymn books , and walked into the church.
Oh , pray , pray for those who are wandering to find graves beyond the foaming billows"
`` I will now give you a picture from Frankfort ,"
said the Moon.
`` I especially noticed one building there.
No , it was a private house , plain in appearance , and painted green.
It stood near the old Jews ' Street.
It was Rothschild 's house.
`` I looked through the open door.
The proprietor of the house stood bare-headed , and respectfully imprinted a kiss on the hand of the old woman.
She was his mother.
Here her children had been born , from hence the fortune of the family had arisen.
If she deserted the despised street and the little house , fortune would also desert her children.
That was her firm belief"
The Moon told me no more ; his visit this evening was far too short.
But I thought of the old woman in the narrow despised street.
`` If I deserted the lowly house , where the fortunes of my sons first began to bloom , fortune would desert them !"
`` In the world it 's always going up and down -- and now I ca n't go up any higher !"
So said Ole the tower-keeper.
This is what he demanded of the world in general -- namely , patent blacking -- and he got nothing but grease.
So he betook himself up thither , and smoked his pipe as he made his solitary rounds.
He looked upward and downward , and had his own thoughts , and told in his way of what he read in books and in himself.
I often lent him books , good books ; and you may know a man by the company he keeps.
I will tell the story of three of these visits , and will reproduce his own words whenever I can remember them"
`` I will give you another picture of Sweden ,"
said the Moon.
`` Among dark pine woods , near the melancholy banks of the Stoxen , lies the old convent church of Wreta.
My rays glided through the grating into the roomy vaults , where kings sleep tranquilly in great stone coffins.
How quietly they sleep ! I can remember them quite plainly.
I still see the bold smile on their lips , that so strongly and plainly expressed joy or grief.
And Fatty wanted them all.
To his delight , there were goodies almost without end.
He nosed about , picking up potato peelings , and bits of bacon.
And perhaps the best of all was a piece of cornbread , which Fatty fairly gobbled.
But Fatty liked them ; and he ate them all , down to the smallest bit.
He was thirsty , then.
So he went down to the brook , which ran close by the camp.
The loggers had cut a hole through the ice , so they could get water.
And Fatty crept close to the edge of the hole and drank.
He drank a great deal of water , because he was very thirsty.
And when he had finished he sat down on the ice for a time.
He did not care to stir about just then.
And he did not think he would ever want anything to eat again.
At last Fatty Coon rose to his feet.
He felt very queer.
There was a strange , tight feeling about his stomach.
And his sides were no longer thin.
They stuck out just as they had before winter came -- only more so.
And what alarmed Fatty was this : his sides seemed to be sticking out more and more all the time.
He wondered what he had been eating.
Those dry things that tasted like apples -- he wondered what they were.
Now , there was some printing on the outside of the box which held those queer , spongy , flat things.
Of course , Fatty Coon could not read , so the printing did him no good at all.
But if you had seen the box , and if you are old enough to read , you would have known that the printing said :"
`` I know you already ,"
I must go and see for myself what kind of a monster it is ,"
added the master , and went quite boldly into the granary and looked round him.
When , however , he saw the strange grim creature with his own eyes , he was no less terrified than the servant had been.
When they had drawn up in the market-place , they marched to the barn , and surrounded it on all sides.
Yet two others ventured in , but they fared no better.
He ordered them to give him some armor , had a sword and spear brought , and armed himself.
All praised his courage , though many feared for his life.
The two barn-doors were opened , and they saw the owl , which in the meantime had perched herself on the middle of a great cross-beam.
George , who slew the dragon.
in a harsh voice.
`` Strike home ! strike home !"
screamed the crowd outside to the valiant hero.
`` Any one who was standing where I am standing ,"
answered he , `` would not cry , strike home !"
He certainly did plant his foot one rung higher on the ladder , but then he began to tremble , and half-fainting , went back again.
And now there was no one left who dared to put himself in such danger.
`` The monster ,"
They took counsel as to what they ought to do to prevent the whole town being destroyed.
For a long time everything seemed to be of no use , but at length the burgomaster found an expedient.
`` My opinion ,"
Thus no one will have to endanger his life.
This is no time for thinking of expense , and niggardliness would be ill applied"
All agreed with him.
So they set fire to the barn at all four corners , and with it the owl was miserably burnt.
Let any one who will not believe it , go thither and inquire for himself"
ONCE upon a time there was a little girl called person_0 , who lived at a farm called Little-town.
THE Kitten went on washing her white paws ; so person_0 asked a speckled hen -- `` Sally Henny-penny , has YOU found three pocket-handkins ?"
But the speckled hen ran into a barn , clucking -- `` I go barefoot , barefoot , barefoot !"
AND then person_0 asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.
Cock Robin looked sideways at person_0 with his bright black eye , and he flew over a stile and away.
person_0 ran on , and on.
THE path ended under a big rock.
LUCIE , knocked -- once -- twice , and interrupted the song.
A little frightened voice called out `` Who 's that ?"
Only the ceiling was so low that person_0 's head nearly touched it ; and the pots and pans were small , and so was everything there.
Her print gown was tucked up , and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat.
said person_0.
`` Have you seen my pocket-handkins ?"
The little person made a bob-curtsey -- `` Oh , yes , if you please 'm ; my name is Mrs.
Tiggy-winkle ; oh , yes if you please 'm , I 'm an excellent clear - starcher !"
And she took something out of a clothes - basket , and spread it on the ironing-blanket.
`` WHAT 'S that thing ?"
said person_0 -- `` that 's not my pocket-handkin ?"
`` Oh no , if you please 'm ; that 's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin !"
And she ironed it and folded it , and put it on one side.
THEN she took something else off a clothes-horse -- `` That is n't my pinny ?"
said person_0.
said Mrs.
Tiggy - winkle"
Thus person_0 's fate was settled , and the general decided to start for the Capital at once , taking person_0 with him.
It need hardly be said that Yama-uba was sad at parting with her boy , for he was all that was left to her.
But she hid her grief with a strong face , as they say in Japan.
When they learned that he was going away for good they followed him to the foot of the mountain to see him off.
`` Kimbo ,"
said his mother , `` mind and be a good boy"
`` Mr.
person_0 ,"
said the faithful animals , `` we wish you good health on your travels"
The general Sadamitsu went on his way rejoicing at having so unexpectedly found such a prodigy as person_0.
Lord Raiko was delighted with the story , and having commanded person_0 to be brought to him , made him one of his vassals at once.
Lord Raiko 's army was famous for its band called `` The Four Braves"
When person_0 grew up to be a man his master made him the Chief of the Four Braves.
He was by far the strongest of them all.
Lord Raiko ordered person_0 to the rescue.
He immediately started off , delighted at the prospect of trying his sword.
Surprising the monster in its den , he made short work of cutting off its great head , which he carried back in triumph to his master.
person_0 now rose to be the greatest hero of his country , and great was the power and honor and wealth that came to him.
Is not this the story of a great hero ?"
I AM always inclined to suspect The best story under the sun As soon as by chance I detect That teller and hero are one.
To prove the truth of what I state Let me an anecdote relate : A Gascon with his comrade sat At tavern drinking.
This and that He vaunted with assertion pat.
From gasconade to gasconade Passed to the conquests he had made In love.
This one he loved for she was fair , That for her glossy ebon hair.
One miss , to tame his cruel rigor , Had brought him gifts.
-- She owned his vigor In short it wanted but his gaze To set each trembling heart ablaze.
There lived in a certain place a Brahman , whose name was Svabhavak_ri_pa_n_a , which means `` a born miser"
He had collected a quantity of rice by begging , and after having dined off it , he filled a pot with what was left over.
Now , if there should be a famine , I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it.
With this I shall buy a couple of goats.
They will have young ones every six months , and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats.
Then , with the goats , I shall buy cows.
As soon as they have calved , I shall sell the calves.
Then , with the calves , I shall buy buffaloes ; with the buffaloes , mares.
When the mares have foaled , I shall have plenty of horses ; and when I sell them , plenty of gold.
With that gold I shall get a house with four wings.
And then a Brahman will come to my house , and will give me his beautiful daughter , with a large dowry.
She will have a son , and I shall call him Somasarman.
Then I get up , and give her such a kick with my foot"
While he thought this , he gave a kick with his foot , and broke the pot.
All the rice fell over him , and made him quite white.
Therefore , I say , `` He who makes foolish plans for the future will be white all over , like the father of Somasarman"
At last the King gave notice that whosoever should capture or kill the wild boar should have his only daughter to wife.
The King said , `` In order that you may be the more sure of finding the beast , you must go into the forest from opposite sides"
So the elder went in on the west side , and the younger on the east.
When the younger had gone a short way , a little man stepped up to him.
He thanked the little man , shouldered the spear , and went on fearlessly.
Then he took the monster on his back and went homewards with it to the King.
But when he saw his young brother coming out of the wood laden with his booty , his envious , evil heart gave him no peace.
He called out to him , `` Come in , dear brother , rest and refresh yourself with a cup of wine"
And when his younger brother did not come back he said , `` The boar must have killed him ,"
and every one believed it.
But as nothing remains hidden from God , so this black deed also was to come to light.
Years afterwards a shepherd was driving his herd across the bridge , and saw lying in the sand beneath , a snow-white little bone.
`` What a wonderful horn !"
said the shepherd ; `` it sings by itself ; I must take it to my lord the King"
And when he came with it to the King the horn again began to sing its little song.
The wicked brother could not deny the deed , and was sewn up in a sack and drowned.
But the bones of the murdered man were laid to rest in a beautiful tomb in the churchyard"
`` Yes ,"
replied the hen , `` come , we will have some pleasure together"
Then they went away to the hill , and on it was a bright day they stayed till evening.
When it was ready , the little hen seated herself in it and said to the cock , `` Thou canst just harness thyself to it"
`` I like that !"
said the cock , `` I would rather go home on foot than let myself be harnessed to it ; no , that is not our bargain.
I do not mind being coachman and sitting on the box , but drag it myself I will not"
and ran with open beak at the cock.
When they had driven a part of the way they met two foot-passengers , a pin and a needle.
They cried , `` Stop ! stop !"
They had been at the tailor 's public-house by the gate , and had stayed too long over the beer.
And now they had themselves well served , and feasted and rioted.
After this he went into the kitchen and wanted to light a pipe , but when he came to the hearth the egg-shell darted into his eyes.
`` This morning everything attacks my head ,"
said he , and angrily sat down on his grandfather 's chair , but he quickly started up again and cried , `` Woe is me ,"
for the needle had pricked him still worse than the pin , and not in the head.
A CLOISTERED nun had a lover Dwelling in the neighb ` ring town ; Both racked their brains to discover How they best their love might crown.
The swain to pass the convent-door ! -- No easy matter ! -- Thus they swore , And wished it light.
-- I ne'er knew a nun In such a pass to be outdone : -- In woman 's clothes the youth must dress , And gain admission.
I confess The ruse has oft been tried before , But it succeeded as of yore.
Together in a close barred cell The lovers were , and sewed all day , Nor heeded how time flew away.
-- `` What 's that I hear ? Refection bell !"
` Tis time to part.
Adieu ! -- Farewell ! -- `` How 's this ?"
exclaimed the abbess , `` why `` The last at table ?"
-- `` Madam , I `` Have had my dress-maker"
-- Madam , ` t would last the whole night through , `` When in our task we find enjoyment `` There is no end of the employment"
On this the mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn , and cleaned the frock with them.
The Lord , who foresaw their suffering , had pity on them , and granted the request.
So the ears were left as they now grow"
A merchant had done good business at the fair ; he had sold his wares , and lined his money-bags with gold and silver.
Then he wanted to travel homewards , and be in his own house before nightfall.
So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse , and rode away.
`` Let it be wanting ,"
answered the merchant ; `` the shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles I have still to go.
I am in a hurry"
Shall I take him to the blacksmith ?"
`` Let it still be wanting ,"
answered the man ; `` the horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which remain.
I am in haste"
He rode forth , but before long the horse began to limp.
It had not limped long before it began to stumble , and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg.
And there he did not arrive until quite late at night.
`` And that unlucky nail ,"
said he to himself , `` has caused all this disaster"
Hasten slowly"
A little brother and sister were once playing by a well , and while they were thus playing , they both fell in.
A water-nix lived down below , who said , `` Now I have got you , now you shall work hard for me !"
and carried them off with her.
Then at last the children became so impatient , that they waited until one Sunday , when the nix was at church , and ran away.
But when church was over , the nix saw that the birds were flown , and followed them with great strides.
Then she thought , `` I will go home quickly and fetch my axe , and cut the hill of glass in half"
SAID one , why brother , she 's your very shade ; The features are the same - : - your looks pervade.
There was once on a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question.
The King of the country heard of it likewise , but did not believe it , and sent for the boy.
The boy said , `` What are the three questions ?"
The King said , `` The first is , how many drops of water are there in the ocean ?"
The King said , `` The next question is , how many stars are there in the sky ?"
The shepherd boy said , `` Give me a great sheet of white paper ,"
Then he said , `` There are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper ; just count them"
But no one was able to do it.
The King said , `` The third question is , how many seconds of time are there in eternity"
There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty , but idle and negligent.
A young man had wooed the lazy girl , and the wedding was to take place.
The storks tell their little ones very many stories , all of the moor and the marsh.
These stories are generally adapted to the age and capacity of the hearers.
The youngest are content if they are told `` Kribble-krabble , plurre-murre"
That history is very well known.
The second is not known yet , perhaps , because it is quite an inland story.
The wilderness there is still a great wide moor-heath , about which we can read in the official description of districts.
Mists are almost always hovering over this region , which seventy years ago was still inhabited by wolves.
It is certainly rightly called the `` wild moor ;"
and one can easily think how dreary and lonely it must have been , and how much marsh and lake there was here a thousand years ago.
Yes , in detail , exactly the same things were seen then that may yet be beheld.
He sank and went down to the `` marsh king ,"
as they called him , who ruled below in the great moorland empire.
They also called him `` gungel king ;"
but we like the name `` marsh king"
better , and by that we 'll call him , as the storks did.
Very little is known of the marsh king 's rule ; but perhaps that is a good thing.
On the roof the stork had built his nest ; and stork-mamma there hatched the eggs , and felt sure that her hatching would come to something.
One evening stork-papa stayed out very long ; and when he came home he looked very bustling and important.
`` I 've something very terrible to tell you ,"
he said to the stork-mamma.
`` Let that be ,"
she replied.
`` Remember that I 'm hatching the eggs , and you might agitate me , and I might do them a mischief"
`` You must know it ,"
he continued.
`` She has arrived here -- the daughter of our host in Egypt -- she has dared to undertake the journey here -- and she 's gone !"
`` You see , mother , she believed in what the doctor said , and you told me true.
She has come here , and she is gone !"
`` You are much too long-winded !"
exclaimed the stork-mamma , `` and the eggs might catch cold.
I ca n't bear being kept in such suspense !"
`` I have kept watch ,"
said the stork-papa ; `` and to-night , when I went into the reeds -- there where the marsh ground will bear me -- three swans came.
`` Yes , certainly ,"
she replied ; `` but tell me about the princess.
I 'm sick of hearing of the swan 's feathers"
`` Well , you know that in the middle of the moor there is something like a lake ,"
continued stork-papa.
`` You can see one corner of it if you raise yourself a little.
The others nodded , and picked up the empty feather dress and took care of it.
` I wonder what they will do with it ? ' thought I ; and perhaps she asked herself the same question.
If so , she got an answer -- a very practical answer -- for the two rose up and flew away with her swan 's plumage.
-LRB- person_2 : THE PRINCESS LEFT IN THE MARSH.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Why , that is terrible !"
said stork-mamma.
`` I ca n't bear to hear any more of it.
But now tell me what happened next"
`` The princess wept and lamented aloud.
Then the poor child was terribly frightened , and sprang up to flee away.
She hurried across to the green slimy ground ; but that can not even carry me , much less her.
She sank immediately , and the alder stump dived down too ; and it was he who drew her down.
Great black bubbles rose up out of the moor-slime , and the last trace of both of them vanished when these burst.
Now the princess is buried in the wild moor , and never more will she bear away a flower to Egypt.
Your heart would have burst , mother , if you had seen it"
`` You ought not to tell me anything of the kind at such a time as this ,"
said stork-mamma ; `` the eggs might suffer by it.
The princess will find some way of escape ; some one will come to help her.
If it had been you or I , or one of our people , it would certainly have been all over with us"
`` But I shall go and look every day to see if anything happens ,"
said stork-papa.
And he was as good as his word.
A long time had passed , when at last he saw a green stalk shooting up out of the deep moor-ground.
When it reached the surface , a leaf spread out and unfolded itself broader and broader ; close by it , a bud came out.
`` But she can not possibly be left lying there ,"
thought stork-papa ; `` and in my nest there are so many persons already.
But stay , I have a thought.
I shall fly with the child to the person_0 's wife.
What rejoicing there will be yonder !"
`` So you see ,"
he concluded , `` the princess is not dead , for she must have sent the little one up here ; and now that is provided for too"
`` Ah , I said it would be so , from the very beginning !"
said the stork-mamma ; `` but now think a little of your own family.
Our traveling time is drawing on ; sometimes I feel quite restless in my wings already.
The cuckoo and the nightingale have started ; and I heard the quails saying that they were going too , so soon as the wind was favourable.
Our young ones will behave well at the exercising , or I am much deceived in them"
The person_0 's wife was extremely glad when she woke next morning and found the charming infant lying in her arms.
She kissed and caressed it ; but it cried violently , and struggled with its arms and legs , and did not seem rejoiced at all.
At length it cried itself to sleep ; and as it lay there still and tranquil , it looked exceedingly beautiful.
Therefore she and the whole household had enough to do in preparing everything for the reception of her lord.
The person_0 's wife herself assisted in the work , so that towards evening she was very tired , and went to sleep quickly and lightly.
she said.
`` Have I had a bad dream ? Is it not my own lovely cherub lying there ?"
And she kissed and hugged it ; but the child struggled and fought like a little wild cat.
A good wind for one is a contrary wind for another.
Here were two natures changing inwardly as well as outwardly with the sunlight.
`` All males here , and ready ,"
they cried ; `` and the wives and children too"
`` How light we feel !"
Ah , how charming it is , traveling to foreign lands !"
`` Mind you keep close to us during your flight ,"
said papa and mamma.
`` Do n't use your beaks too much , for that tires the chest"
And the storks flew away.
-LRB- person_2 : THE VIKING 'S FEAST.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa And life and tumultuous joy came with them into the person_0 's castle on the moorland.
Guests were invited , and received handsome gifts : all feuds and all malice were forgotten.
And with that they beat upon their shields , and hammered the table in glorious fashion with bones and knives.
The person_0 's wife sat upon the high seat in the open hall.
She wore a silken dress , and golden armlets , and great amber beads : she was in her costliest garb.
And the bard mentioned her in his song , and sang of the rich treasure she had brought her rich husband.
He declared that the girl might grow up to be a stately heroine , strong and determined as a man.
She would not wink her eyes when a practiced hand cut off her eyebrows with a sword by way of a jest.
The full mead barrel was emptied , and a fresh one brought in ; for these were people who liked to enjoy all things plentifully.
Yes , they knew it well enough ; but one _ knows _ one thing , and one _ does _ another.
They also knew that `` even the welcome guest becomes wearisome when he sitteth long in the house ;"
The rough damp mist of autumn , which devours the leaves of the forest , had already descended upon thicket and heath.
`` Birds feather-less ,"
as they called the snow , flew in thick masses , and winter was coming on fast.
Great troops divided the nests , built close together on venerable pillars and in fallen temple arches of forgotten cities.
The young storks thought it was optical illusion , they found everything so glorious.
`` Yes , it 's delightful here ; and it 's always like this in our warm country ,"
said the stork-mamma ; and the young ones felt quite frisky on the strength of it.
`` Is there anything more to be seen ?"
they asked.
`` Are we to go much farther into the country ?"
`` There 's nothing further to be seen ,"
answered stork-mamma.
It is best to stay here , where there are frogs and locusts.
I shall stay here , and you shall stay too"
And there they remained.
There was sunshine every day , and every day plenty to eat , and nothing to think of but pleasure.
But in the rich castle at the Egyptian host 's , as they called him , there was no pleasure to be found.
His family and servants surrounded him , for he was not dead , though one could not exactly say that he was alive.
The healing moor flower from the North , which was to have been found and brought home by her who loved him best , never appeared.
`` She is dead !"
By the shore of the lake , under a weeping birch tree , we laid her in the cool earth.
But we had our revenge.
Never will she return to the land of Egypt"
And then the two wept.
And when stork-papa heard the story , he clapped with his beak so that it could be heard a long way off.
-LRB- person_2 : THE KING OF EGYPT DECEIVED BY THE PRINCESSES.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Treachery and lies !"
he cried.
`` I should like to run my beak deep into their chests"
`` And perhaps break it off ,"
interposed the stork-mamma ; `` and then you would look well.
Think first of yourself , and then of your family , and all the rest does not concern you"
But for all that we may listen to what the people said , for we have to listen to a great deal of talk in the world.
`` Love gives life ! the highest love gives the highest life ! Only through love can his life be preserved"
That is what they all said , and the learned men said it was very cleverly and beautifully spoken.
`` That is a beautiful thought !"
stork-papa said immediately.
`` I do n't quite understand it ,"
stork-mamma replied : `` and that 's not my fault , but the fault of the thought.
But let it be as it will , I 've something else to think of"
But one thing stork-papa understood.
and on this occasion they had surpassed themselves , and said more than they understood.
They repeated it , and wrote down as a recipe , `` Love begets life"
But how was the thing to be prepared according to the recipe ? that was a point they could not get over.
And therefore she had gone forth in the swan 's plumage out of the land of Egypt to the open heath , to the woodland moor.
And the stork-papa and stork-mamma knew all this ; and now we also know it more accurately than we knew it before.
We know that the marsh king had drawn her down to himself , and know that to her loved ones at home she is dead for ever.
One of the wisest of them said , as the stork-mamma said too , `` She will manage to help herself ;"
`` I should like to take away the swan 's feathers from the two faithless princesses ,"
said the stork-papa ; `` then , at any rate , they will not be able to fly up again to the wild moor and do mischief.
I 'll hide the two swan-feather suits up there , till somebody has occasion for them"
`` But where do you intend to hide them ?"
asked stork-mamma.
`` Up in our nest in the moor ,"
answered he.
Certainly , one suit of swan 's feathers would be enough for the princess , but two are always better.
In those northern countries no one can have too many wraps"
`` No one will thank you for it ,"
quoth stork-mamma ; `` but you 're the master.
Except at breeding-time , I have nothing to say"
It was a pleasure to her to splash about with her white hands in the blood of the horse that had been slain in sacrifice.
I should never do it , for my ears still tingle with the blow that thou gavest me years ago -- thou ! I have never forgotten it"
`` Self-achieved is well-achieved ,"
she said.
-LRB- person_2 : THE TRANSFORMED PRINCESS.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa But there was one thing that imposed a check upon person_1 , and that was the evening twilight.
Her eyes then assumed a very melancholy expression.
She had no voice , and could only utter a hollow croaking that sounded like the stifled sob of a dreaming child.
`` One can scarcely believe that she was ever so small that she could lie in the cup of a water-lily ,"
said stork-papa , `` now she 's grown up the image of her Egyptian mother.
`` And our good nest would be destroyed too ,"
said stork-mamma ; `` but you think less of that than of your plumage stuff and of your moor-princess.
You 'd best go down into the mud and stay there with her.
You 're a bad father to your own children , as I said already when I hatched our first brood.
I only hope neither we nor our children will get an arrow in our wings through that wild girl.
person_1 does n't know in the least what she does.
You should have just left her lying in the water-lily , and she would have been dead long ago"
`` You are much better than your words ,"
said stork-papa.
`` I know you better than you know yourself"
There was power in it , and dash ! `` After all , he 's handsomer than any of them ,"
said stork-mamma to herself ; `` but I wo n't tell him so"
Early in that autumn the person_0 came home , laden with booty , and bringing prisoners with him.
Among these was a young person_3 priest , one of those who contemned the gods of the North.
It seemed as if she only understood the meaning of the word `` love ,"
In the deep cellars of the person_0 's house the young priest had been immured , his hands and feet bound with strips of bark.
For the first time a man was to be sacrificed here.
person_1 begged , as a boon , that she might sprinkle the image of the god and the assembled multitude with the blood of the priest.
as she said.
`` Thy hard time will come ,"
said the person_0 's wife ; `` and it will be terrible to me too.
It had been better if thou hadst been set out by the high-road , and the night wind had lulled thee to sleep"
The wrinkled frog crouched in the corner alone.
A deep silence reigned around ; but at intervals a half-stifled sigh escaped from its breast , from the breast of person_1.
It seemed as though a painful new life were arising in her inmost heart.
She came forward and listened ; and , stepping forward again , grasped with her clumsy hands the heavy pole that was laid across before the door.
It seemed as if a strong hidden will gave her strength.
She drew back the iron bolt from the closed cellar door , and crept in to the captive.
He was asleep ; and when he awoke and saw the hideous form , he shuddered as though he had beheld a wicked apparition.
She drew her knife , cut the bonds that confined his hands and feet , and beckoned him to follow her.
-LRB- person_2 : THE FLIGHT.
The frog-woman beckoned him to follow , and led him through corridors shrouded with curtains , into the stables , and there pointed to a horse.
He mounted on its back ; but she also sprang up before him , holding fast by the horse 's mane.
Then she trembled.
person_1 was again the beautiful maiden with the wicked , demoniac spirit.
This seemed to him a new and terrible sorcery ; but person_1 likewise leaped from the saddle , and stood on the ground.
The child 's short garment reached only to her knee.
She plucked the sharp knife from her girdle , and quick as lightning she rushed in upon the astonished priest.
`` Let me get at thee !"
she screamed ; `` let me get at thee , and plunge this knife in thy body ! Thou art pale as straw , thou beardless slave !"
She pressed in upon him.
They struggled together in a hard strife , but an invisible power seemed given to the person_3 captive.
-LRB- person_2 : THE CHRISTIAN PRIEST 'S SPELL.
But he would not let her sit before him on the horse , though of her own accord she offered to do so.
`` Thou must sit behind me , not before me ,"
he said.
And he knelt down and prayed fervently.
It seemed as though the woodland scenes were consecrated as a holy church by his prayer.
Patiently she suffered the priest to lift her on the horse , and sat like a somnambulist , neither completely asleep nor wholly awake.
The person_3 bound two branches together with bark , in the form of a cross , which he held up high as they rode through the forest.
The wood became thicker as they went on , and at last became a trackless wilderness.
The wild sloe grew across the way , so that they had to ride round the bushes.
The bubbling spring became not a stream but a standing marsh , round which likewise they were obliged to lead the horse.
They say the rain-drops can hollow the hard stone , and the waves of the sea can smooth and round the sharp edges of the rocks.
Thus did the dew of mercy , that dropped upon person_1 , smooth what was rough , and penetrate what was hard in her.
-LRB- person_2 : HELGA AND THE PRIEST ATTACKED BY ROBBERS.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Where hast thou stolen that beauteous maiden ?"
cried the robbers ; and they seized the horse 's bridle , and dragged the two riders from its back.
The priest had no weapon save the knife he had taken from person_1 ; and with this he tried to defend himself.
Then person_1 seemed suddenly to wake from her long reverie , and threw herself hastily upon the gasping animal.
Then the robbers were seized with terror , and let her go.
The full moon was already rising.
Presently it shone with splendid radiance over the earth , and poor person_1 crept forth from the thicket in the wretched frog 's shape.
She stood still beside the corpse of the priest and the carcase of the slain horse.
At last she saw that her endeavors would not succeed.
Then she brought the heaviest stones she could carry and laid them over the dead body , stopping up the interstices with moss.
And now she thought the grave-hill would be strong and secure.
-LRB- person_2 : HELGA IN THE TREE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa Then in this transformation it seemed as if two natures were striving within her.
Her whole frame trembled , and she looked around , as if she had just awoke from a troubled dream.
Butterflies fluttered around in sport , and in the neighborhood were several ant-hills , each with its hundreds of busy little occupants moving briskly to and fro.
But they could not understand her -- nor , indeed , could she understand herself.
When the evening twilight came on , and the sun was sinking , the time of her transformation roused her to fresh activity.
On the sepulchral mound she had raised there yet lay the cross of boughs , the last work of him who slept beneath.
person_1 lifted up the cross , in pursuance of a sudden thought that came upon her.
She planted it upon the burial mound , over the priest and the dead horse.
Then the frog-skin fell from her , and she was once more the beauteous maiden.
But her head sank wearily , her tired limbs required rest , and she fell into a deep slumber.
Her sleep , however , was short.
Towards midnight she awoke.
the person_0 woman would have said ; and yet he seemed to stand in a flame of fire.
Beautiful person_1 trembled at the look , and her remembrance awoke as though she stood before the tribunal of judgment.
-LRB- person_2 : HELGA IS TAKEN BACK TO THE MARSH.
`` Thou daughter of the moorland ,"
he said , `` out of the earth , out of the moor , thou camest ; but from the earth thou shalt arise.
I come from the land of the dead.
Thou , too , shalt pass through the deep valleys into the beaming mountain region , where dwell mercy and completeness.
And he lifted her upon the horse , and gave her a golden censer similar to the one she had seen in the person_0 's castle.
The open wound in the forehead of the slain person_3 shone like a diadem.
He took the cross from the grave and held it aloft.
The golden hoop on the forehead of each gleamed in the moonlight , and their mantles floated in the night breeze.
The dragon that guards buried treasures likewise lifted up his head and gazed after the riders.
Over woodland and heath , over river and marsh they fled away , up to the wild moor ; and over this they hovered in wide circles.
The person_3 priest held the cross aloft ; it gleamed like gold ; and from his lips dropped pious prayers.
Beautiful person_1 joined in the hymns he sang , like a child joining in its mother 's song.
Every germ came forth from the deep ground.
All that had life lifted itself up.
A veil of water-lilies spread itself forth like a carpet of wrought flowers , and upon this carpet lay a sleeping woman , young and beautiful.
person_1 thought it was her own likeness she saw upon the mirror of the calm waters.
But it was her mother whom she beheld , the moor king 's wife , the princess from the banks of the Nile.
But the holy sign gave strength to the airy phantom , and then the three rode from the moor to the firm land.
-LRB- person_2 : HELGA MEETS WITH HER MOTHER IN THE MARSH.
`` Am I really looking at my own image from beneath the deep waters ?"
asked the mother.
`` Is it myself that I see reflected on the clear mirror ?"
exclaimed the daughter.
And they approached one another , and embraced.
The heart of the mother beat quickest , and she understood the quickening pulses.
`` My child ! thou flower of my own heart ! my lotos-flower of the deep waters !"
And she embraced her child anew , and wept ; and the tears were as a new baptism of life and love to person_1.
`` In the swan 's plumage came I hither ,"
said the mother ; `` and here also I threw off my dress of feathers.
I sank through the shaking moorland , far down into the black slime , which closed like a wall around me.
But soon I felt a fresher stream ; a power drew me down , deeper and ever deeper.
I felt the weight of sleep upon my eyelids ; I slumbered , and dreams hovered round me.
He seized me in his arms , and I felt as if I must die.
When I returned to consciousness a little bird was sitting on my bosom , beating with its wings , and twittering and singing.
The bird flew away from me up towards the heavy , dark covering ; but a long green band still fastened him to me.
Since that hour I have dreamed no more.
I have slept a sleep , a long and heavy sleep , till within this hour ; harmony and incense awoke me and set me free"
`` And now we will speak with one another ,"
quoth stork-papa , `` now we understand each other , though the beak of one bird is differently shaped from that of another.
It happens more than fortunately that you came to-night.
To-morrow we should have been gone -- mother , myself , and the young ones ; for we 're flying southward.
She always declared the princess would find a way to help herself ; and I and the young ones carried the swan 's feathers up here.
`` And the lotos-flower which I was to bring with me ,"
Homeward ! homeward !"
But person_1 declared she could not quit the Danish land before she had once more seen her foster-mother , the affectionate person_0 woman.
`` Yes , we must go to the person_0 's castle ,"
said stork-papa ; `` mother and the youngsters are waiting for us there.
I 'll begin clapping at once , that they may know we 're coming"
And stork-papa clapped in first-rate style , and they all flew away towards the person_0 's castle.
In the castle every one was sunk in deep sleep.
The person_0 's wife had not retired to rest until it was late.
The war-trumpet sounded , and the gods rode over the rainbow , clad in steel , to fight the last battle.
The winged Valkyrs rode before them , and the dead warriors closed the train.
The whole firmament was ablaze with northern lights , and yet the darkness seemed to predominate.
It was a terrible hour.
The air resounded with the blows of clubs and swords , and with the hissing of arrows , as if a hailstorm were passing across it.
`` White person_3 !"
she cried aloud , and with these words she pressed a kiss upon the forehead of the hideous frog-child.
The person_0 woman woke ; and she heard the same noise without still continuing.
She knew it was the time for the storks to depart , and that it must be those birds whose wings she heard.
She wished to see them once more , and to bid them farewell as they set forth on their journey.
And she remembered her dream , which still filled her soul as if it were reality.
She thought of person_1 in the shape of a swan , and of the person_3 priest ; and suddenly she felt her heart rejoice within her.
-LRB- person_2 : THE DISGUISED PRINCESSES BID FAREWELL TO THE VIKING WOMAN.
Then all the storks arose , flapping their wings and clapping with their beaks , to start on their voyage towards the South.
`` We will not wait for the swans ,"
said stork-mamma : `` if they want to go with us they had better come.
We ca n't sit here till the plovers start.
What are yonder swans flapping their wings for ?"
`` Well , everyone flies in his own fashion ,"
said stork-papa : `` the swans in an oblique line , the cranes in a triangle , and the plovers in a snake 's line"
`` Do n't talk about snakes while we are flying up here ,"
said stork-mamma.
`` It only puts ideas into the children 's heads which ca n't be gratified"
`` Are those the high mountains of which I heard tell ?"
asked person_1 , in the swan 's plumage.
`` They are storm clouds driving on beneath us ,"
replied her mother.
`` What are yonder white clouds that rise so high ?"
asked person_1 again.
`` Those are the mountains covered with perpetual snow which you see yonder ,"
replied her mother.
And they flew across the lofty Alps towards the blue Mediterranean.
`` Africa 's land ! Egypt 's strand !"
And all the birds caught sight of it , and hastened their flight.
`` I can scent the Nile mud and wet frogs ,"
said stork-mamma ; `` I begin to feel quite hungry.
Yes ; now you shall taste something nice ; and you will see the maraboo bird , the crane , and the ibis.
They all belong to our family , though they are not nearly so beautiful as we.
They give themselves great airs , especially the ibis.
He has been quite spoilt by the Egyptians , for they make a mummy of him and stuff him with spices.
I would rather be stuffed with live frogs , and so would you , and so you shall.
Better have something in one 's inside while one is alive than to be made a fuss with after one is dead.
That 's my opinion , and I am always right"
`` Now the storks are come ,"
Friends and servants stood around his couch.
-LRB- person_2 : THE KING OF EGYPT 'S RECOVERY.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa And into the hall flew two beauteous swans.
They had come with the storks.
They threw off their dazzling white plumage , and two lovely female forms were revealed , as like each other as two dewdrops.
`` Now , at last , you will become something ,"
whispered stork-mamma , `` there 's no doubt about that"
`` What should I become ?"
asked stork-papa.
`` What have I done ? Nothing at all !"
You already look like an Egyptian doctor ; at least in my eyes"
`` I can not quite repeat the words as they were spoken ,"
`` And what did you receive ?"
asked stork-mamma.
Late in the night , when the gentle peace of sleep rested upon the now happy house , there was one who still watched.
It was not stork-papa , though he stood upon one leg , and slept on guard -- it was person_1 who watched.
She seemed to lose herself in the increasing happiness , in contemplation of what might come , of what would come.
There she saw two great ostriches running round rapidly in a narrow circle.
And the ostrich answered , `` I will"
Proudly the ostrich flew straight towards the light , boasting of his strength , and not thinking of the Giver or saying , `` God willing !"
And seriousness struck its roots deep into her mind and heart.
A rich life in present and future happiness was given and won ; and what was yet to come ? the best of all ,"
_ God willing _"
`` That 's heavy to carry ,"
thought the stork-papa , when he had the golden ring round his neck ; `` but gold and honor are not to be flung into the street.
The stork brings good fortune ; they 'll be obliged to acknowledge that over yonder"
`` You lay gold and I lay eggs ,"
said the stork-mamma.
`` Still one has one 's inward consciousness , mother ,"
replied stork-papa.
`` But you ca n't hang that round your neck ,"
stork-mamma retorted ; `` and it wo n't give you a good wind or a good meal"
The little nightingale , singing yonder in the tamarind tree , will soon be going north too.
And the nightingale flew away -- and time flew away.
-LRB- person_2 : A MESSAGE TO THE VIKING WOMAN.
And , indeed , they returned on that very day that was so rich in joy and gladness.
Here a marriage was celebrated , and fair person_1 was the bride , shining in jewels and silk.
The bridegroom was the young Arab prince , and bride and bridegroom sat together at the upper end of the table , between mother and grandfather.
Then strong wings were heard beating the air.
said stork-papa.
`` But it 's very little ,"
observed stork-mamma.
`` They could not possibly have done less"
And when person_1 saw them , she rose and came on to the verandah , to stroke the backs of the storks.
The old pair waved their heads and bowed their necks , and even the youngest among the young ones felt highly honored by the reception.
It was the spirit of the dead person_3 priest ; he too was coming to her wedding feast -- coming from heaven.
`` The glory and brightness yonder outshines everything that is known on earth !"
he said.
Then he bore her up amid splendor and glory.
Not only around her , but within her , sounded voices and beamed a brightness that words can not express.
`` Now we must go back ; thou wilt be missed ,"
he said.
`` Only one more look !"
she begged.
`` But one short minute more !"
`` We must go back to the earth.
The guests will all depart"
`` Only one more look -- the last"
Alone she went through the empty great hall into the next chamber.
Strange warriors slept yonder.
Three minutes only in heaven and a whole night on earth had passed away ! Then she saw the storks again.
She called to them , spoke their language ; and stork-papa turned his head towards her , listened to her words , and drew near.
`` You speak our language ,"
he said ; `` what do you wish ? Why do you appear here -- you , a strange woman ?"
`` It is I -- it is person_1 -- dost thou not know me ? Three minutes ago we were speaking together yonder in the verandah !"
`` That 's a mistake ,"
said the stork ; `` you must have dreamt all that !"
`` No , no !"
she persisted.
And she reminded him of the person_0 's castle , and of the great ocean , and of the journey hither.
And thus it was.
person_1 saw it , and understood it , and sank on her knees.
`` Well , that 's a new ending to the story ,"
said stork-papa.
`` I had certainly not expected it.
But I like it very well"
`` But what will the young ones say to it ?"
said stork-mamma.
`` Yes , certainly , that 's the important point ,"
replied he"
The ocean is the high road between the nations -- transport thyself thither in thought to sunny Spain.
The whole is like a glorious dream.
`` We are as happy as it is possible to be ,"
And the days went by like a glad festival.
`` Life is a gracious gift of Providence , an almost inappreciable gift !"
said the young wife , `` and yet they tell us that fulness of joy is found only in the future life , for ever and ever.
I can not compass the thought"
`` And perhaps the thought arises from the arrogance of men ,"
said the husband.
`` It seems a great pride to believe that we shall live for ever , that we shall be as gods.
Were these not the words of the serpent , the origin of falsehood ?"
`` Surely you do not doubt the future life ?"
exclaimed the young wife ; and it seemed as if one of the first shadows flitted over the sunny heaven of her thoughts.
`` Faith promises it , and the priests tells us so !"
replied the man ; `` but amid all my happiness , I feel that it is arrogance to demand a continued happiness , another life after this.
`` Yes , it has been given to _ us _ ,"
`` Yonder beggar ,"
`` HE has said , ` In my Father 's house are many mansions , '"
replied the young wife : `` heaven is immeasurable , as the love of our Maker is immeasurable.
`` This world is sufficient for me !"
-LRB- person_4 : IN SPAIN.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Such a moment ,"
he said , `` makes it worth while to be born , to fall , and to disappear !"
and he smiled.
The young wife raised her hand in mild reproach , and the shadow passed away from her world , and they were happy -- quite happy.
Everything seemed to work together for them.
They advanced in honor , in prosperity , and in joy.
There was a change , indeed , but only a change of place ; not in enjoyment of life and of happiness.
The young man was sent by his sovereign as ambassador to the court of Russia.
This was an honorable office , and his birth and his acquirements gave him a title to be thus honored.
Petersburg.
And all the arrangements on board were princely -- rich carpets for the feet , and silk and luxury on all sides.
In an old heroic song , `` The King 's Son of England ,"
Thus weeks passed away , two full months ; and then at last the fair wind blew -- it blew from the south-west.
This all happened a long , long while ago.
King Christian VII.
then sat on the Danish throne , and he was still a young man.
Much has happened since that time , much has changed or has been changed.
In Western person_5 one may go back in thought to the old times , farther back than the days when Christian VII.
bore rule.
As it did then , in person_5 , the brown heath now also extends for miles , with its `` Hun 's Graves ,"
Thus it is there to-day , and thus it was many , many years ago , when the happy pair were sailing in the gorgeous ship.
Most of them are without steeples , and the bells are hung between two beams in the open air.
Rough mounds show where the dead had been buried , and rank grass , tossed by the wind , grows thickly over the whole churchyard.
The wind and the sea fog soon destroy the wood.
She stood still in front of it , and let her glance rest on the discolored memorial.
A few moments afterwards her husband stepped up to her.
`` That was a good sermon to-day ,"
the man said at length.
`` If we had not person_1 to look to , we should have nothing !"
`` Yes ,"
observed the woman , `` He sends joy and sorrow , and He has a right to send them.
To-morrow our little boy would have been five years old , if we had been allowed to keep him"
`` You will gain nothing by fretting , wife ,"
said the man.
`` The boy is well provided for.
He is there whither we pray to go"
And they said nothing more , but went forward to their house among the sand-hills.
A gust of wind swept in among the hills , whirling the particles of sand high in the air.
Man and wife stepped into the house.
A few neighbors came up , and helped one another to draw the boats higher up on the sand.
The waves reared themselves up with their white crowns of foam , and the wind cut off their crests , flinging the foam far around.
The evening came on.
The sand rattled against the window panes , and every now and then came a violent gust of wind , that shook the house to its foundations.
It was dark , but towards midnight the moon would rise.
The air became clearer , but the storm swept in all its gigantic force over the perturbed sea.
The fisher people had long gone to bed , but in such weather there was no chance of closing an eye.
In a moment the fish people had sprung from their couch , and hastily arrayed themselves.
It required a practiced eye to descry the vessel out in the offing.
The vessel was a noble brig.
The billows now lifted it over the reef , three or four cables ' lengths out of the usual channel.
It drove towards the land , struck against the second reef , and remained fixed.
-LRB- person_4 : SAVED FROM THE WRECK.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa To render assistance was impossible ; the sea rolled fairly in upon the vessel , making a clean breach over her.
Those on shore fancied they heard the cries of help from on board , and could plainly descry the busy useless efforts made by the stranded crew.
Now a wave came rolling onward , falling like a rock upon the bowsprit , and tearing it from the brig.
The stern was lifted high above the flood.
How beautiful and fair she was ! certainly she must be a great lady.
It was with her ship as with the vessel in the song of `` The King 's Son of England"
`` Alas , it was a grief to see How the gallant ship sank speedily"
Portions of wreck and fragments of wood drifted ashore , and they were all that remained of what had been the ship.
The wind still drove howling over the coast.
For a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest ; but she awoke in pain , and cries of anguish and fear came from her lips.
She opened her wonderfully beautiful eyes , and spoke a few words , but none understood her.
The ship had been stranded some distance south of Nissum Bay.
No one knew who the dead stranger was , or could even form a conjecture.
The pieces of wreck said nothing on the subject.
Into the rich house in Spain no tidings penetrated of the fate of the daughter and the son-in-law.
They had not arrived at their destined post , and violent storms had raged during the past weeks.
At last the verdict was given , `` Foundered at sea -- all lost"
But in the sand-hills near Hunsby , in the fisherman 's hut , lived a little scion of the rich Spanish family.
And they called the boy person_9.
`` It must certainly be a Jewish child ,"
the people said , `` it looks so swarthy"
`` It might be an Italian or a Spaniard ,"
observed the clergyman.
But to the fisherwoman these three nations seemed all the same , and she consoled herself with the idea that the child was baptized as a Christian.
The boy throve.
The noble blood in his veins was warm , and he became strong on his homely fare.
He grew apace in the humble house , and the Danish dialect spoken by the West Jutes became his language.
The pomegranate seed from Spanish soil became a hardy plant on the coast of West person_5.
Such may be a man 's fate ! To this home he clung with the roots of his whole being.
Childhood has sunny heights for all , whose memory gleams through the whole after life.
The boy had many opportunities for pleasure and play.
One day another ship was stranded there.
Among other things , a chest of rare flower bulbs floated ashore.
Would it be better with person_9 ? The flower bulbs had soon played their part , but he had still years of apprenticeship before him.
Neither he nor his friends remarked in what a solitary and uniform way one day succeeded another ; for there was plenty to do and to see.
The sea itself was a great lesson book , unfolding a new leaf every day , such as calm and storm , breakers and waifs.
The visits to the church were festal visits.
But among the festal visits in the fisherman 's house , one was particularly distinguished.
He used to come in a cart painted red , and filled with eels.
The cart was covered and locked like a box , and painted all over with blue and white tulips.
It was drawn by two dun oxen , and person_9 was allowed to guide them.
The eel breeder was a witty fellow , a merry guest , and brought a measure of brandy with him.
' ` They 'll come again , ' said the mother-eel.
` Oh no , ' exclaimed the daughters , ` for he skinned them , and cut them in two , and fried them.
' ` Oh , they 'll come again , ' the mother-eel persisted.
` No , ' replied the daughters , ` for he ate them up.
' ` They 'll come again , ' repeated the mother-eel.
` But he drank brandy after them , ' continued the daughters.
' `` And therefore ,"
said the eel breeder , in conclusion , `` it is always right to take brandy after eating eels"
-LRB- person_4 : THE EEL BREEDER 'S VISIT.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa And this story was the tinsel thread , the most humorous recollection of person_9 's life.
But he wished to go a little way past the sand-hills , a little way into the dunes , and he succeeded in doing so.
He was to go to a festival -- though it was certainly a burial feast.
A wealthy relative of the fisherman 's family had died.
The farm lay deep in the country , eastward , and a point towards the north , as the saying is.
person_9 's foster-parents were to go , and he was to accompany them from the dunes , across heath and moor.
Past this castle went person_9 and his foster-parents.
He never forgot it , nor the lime tree : the child 's soul treasured up these remembrances of beauty and fragrance to gladden the old man.
So they pursued their journey in the waggon across the rugged heath.
The oxen which drew the vehicle slipped every now and then , where a patch of fresh grass appeared amid the heather.
`` That is Lokeman driving his sheep ,"
said some one ; and this was enough to excite the fancy of person_9.
It seemed to him as if they were now going to enter fairyland , though everything was still real.
How quiet it was ! Far and wide the heath extended around them like a beautiful carpet.
The heather bloomed ; the juniper bushes and the fresh oak saplings stood up like nosegays from the earth.
The journey over the heath and the deep sand was only too quickly accomplished.
They stopped before the house of mourning , where they found plenty of guests within and without.
Waggon after waggon stood ranged in a row , and horses and oxen went out to crop the scanty pasture.
Great sand-hills , like those at home in the North Sea , rose behind the house , and extended far and wide.
person_9 went to and fro in the house.
On the third day he felt quite at home , like as in the fisherman 's hut on the sand-hills where he had passed his early days.
Here was a Hun 's Grave , and yonder another.
Columns of smoke rose into the still air ; it was a heath-fire , he was told , that shone so splendidly in the dark evening.
Now came the fourth day , and the funeral festivities were to conclude , and they were to go back from the land-dunes to the sand-dunes.
`` Ours are the best ,"
said the old fisherman , person_9 's foster-father ; `` these have no strength"
And they spoke of the way in which the sand-dunes had come into the country , and it seemed all very intelligible.
So the grave was opened , and he really was found with his thumb in his mouth.
All this person_9 heard and treasured in his memory from the happiest days of his childhood , the days of the burial feast.
How glorious it was to get out into strange regions , and to see strange people ! And he was to go farther still.
`` I shall come again !"
said a voice within him.
He saw the Spanish coast , the native land of his parents.
The poor ship boy was not allowed to land ; but on the last day of their stay he managed to get ashore.
There were several purchases to be made , and he was to carry them on board.
person_9 hardly knew where he was or which way he went.
Even the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into the temple.
The sailor with whom person_9 went took his way through the church ; and person_9 stood in the sanctuary.
Coloured pictures gleamed from their golden ground.
From the church they went to the market-place.
Here a quantity of provisions were given him to carry.
Here he rested his burden against the wall.
Then a liveried porter came out , lifted up a silver-headed cane , and drove him away -- him , the grandson of the house.
But no one there knew that , and he just as little as any one.
And afterwards he went on board again , and there were hard words and cuffs , little sleep and much work ; such were his experiences.
They say that it is well to suffer in youth , if age brings something to make up for it.
A hard winter followed that summer.
Snowstorms swept over land and sea , and there was a difficulty in getting about.
How variously things were distributed in the world ! here biting cold and snowstorms , while in the Spanish land there was burning sunshine and oppressive heat.
He determined to go there once more.
Spring came on , and the fishery began.
person_9 was an active assistant in this ; he had grown in the last year , and was quick at work.
He was full of life , he understood how to swim , to tread water , to turn over and tumble in the flood.
They were sitting behind the cabin door , eating out of a delf plate which they had placed between them.
person_8 only said , `` Ah ! ha ! you 're one of that sort , who are fond of using the knife !"
Hardly were the words spoken , when person_9 's hand sank down.
He answered not a syllable , but went on eating , and afterwards walked away to his work.
But I feel as if I had a pot in me that boiled over"
`` There let the thing rest ,"
They were both young and strong , well-grown and stalwart ; but person_9 was the cleverer of the two.
In Norway the peasants go into the mountains , and lead out the cattle there to pasture.
There are sleeping-places around the walls , and here the fisher people live and sleep during the early spring.
Moreover , the managers bring up the fish from the boat , cut them open , prepare them , and have generally a great deal to do.
person_9 , his father , and several other fishermen and their managers inhabited the same hut ; person_8 lived in the next one.
And it seemed to person_9 as if the loose sand were giving way under his feet.
He spoke not a word , but only nodded his head , which signified `` yes"
One of the men stands upright in the bow of the boat , and the others watch him , sitting with the oars in their hands.
A wrong order given in front of the reef -- the slightest hesitation -- and the boat must founder.
`` Then it would be all over with me , and person_8 too !"
This thought struck person_9 while they were out at sea , where his foster-father had been taken alarmingly ill.
.
The fever had seized him.
They were only a few oars ' strokes from the reef , and person_9 sprang from his seat , and stood up in the bow.
`` Father -- let me come !"
But he could not weave the fibers together , nor did he endeavor to do so.
He felt that person_8 had despoiled him , and this was enough to make him detest his former friend.
Several of the fishermen noticed this , but not person_8 , who continued obliging and talkative -- the latter a little too much.
It was but a little house , certainly , but still it was something , and person_8 had nothing of the kind.
`` You will not take sea service again , person_9 ?"
observed one of the old fishermen.
`` You will always stay with us , now"
But this was not person_9 's intention , for he was just thinking of looking about him a little in the world.
-LRB- person_4 : ELSE AFFIRMS HER PREFERENCE FOR MARTIN.
And person_9 thought of many things.
The sea has heavy waves , but there are heavier waves in the human heart.
`` But person_8 has no house , and can not get one"
`` But let us suppose he had one"
`` Why then I would certainly take person_8 , for that 's what my heart tells me ; but one ca n't live upon that"
And person_9 thought of these things all night through.
And Else kissed him on the mouth when she heard that , for she loved person_8 best.
In the early morning person_9 purposed to start.
The old man made jokes about person_8 , and declared there must be some magic about that fellow , `` of whom all the girls were so fond"
person_9 paid no heed to this speech , but said farewell to the old man , and went on towards the house where person_8 dwelt.
He heard loud talking within.
The sea lay pure and blue before him , and mussel shells and sea pebbles , the playthings of his youth , crunched under his feet.
While he was thus marching on , his nose suddenly began to bleed : it was a trifling incident , but little things can have great significances.
A few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves.
He wiped them off and stopped the bleeding , and it seemed to him as if this had cleared and lightened his brain.
In the sand the sea-eringa was blooming here and there.
as the young eels had said.
`` Beware of bad people , who will catch you and flay you , cut you in two , and put you in the frying-pan !"
He looked back , and saw a couple of horsemen gallopping a long distance behind him , and they were accompanied by other people.
But this concerned him nothing.
The ferry was on the opposite side of the bay.
`` Thy wicked deed will cost thee thy life ,"
they said.
`` It is well that we caught thee"
He was accused of nothing less than murder.
person_8 had been found dead , with a knife thrust through his neck.
No attention was paid to the defense made by person_9 ; the few drops of blood upon his shirt-sleeve bore heavy witness against him.
But person_9 was conscious of innocence ; and as there was no chance of immediately righting himself , he submitted to his fate.
Here Long Martha had been imprisoned , and hence she had been led away to the scaffold.
In the midst of the cellar roof was a little narrow air-hole , but no window.
The blooming lindens could not waft a breath of comforting fragrance into that abode , where all was dark and mouldy.
Only a rough bench stood in the prison ; but `` a good conscience is a soft pillow ,"
and consequently person_9 could sleep well.
He was not left there long.
They carried him off to the town of Ringkjoebing , where his imprisonment was just as hard.
Those times were not like ours.
Hard measure was dealt out to the `` common"
The spring storms began to blow.
person_9 , in his prison , heard these sounds , and it was a relief to him.
Sometimes , when such thoughts crossed his mind , the fiery nature rose within him , and he beat the wall with his clenched fists.
This was circumstantially explained ; but for us it is enough to know that person_9 was set at liberty.
person_0 heard the whole story ; and the man had a good heart , and understood what person_9 must have felt and suffered.
He therefore made up his mind to make it up to the poor lad , and convince him that there were still kind folks in the world.
So person_9 went forth from the prison as if to Paradise , to find freedom , affection , and trust.
said person_0 the merchant.
`` Let us draw a thick line through last year ; and we will even burn the calendar.
And in two days we 'll start for dear , friendly , peaceful person_7.
They call person_7 an out-of-the-way corner ; but it 's a good warm chimney-corner , and its windows open towards every part of the world"
was seen likewise.
-LRB- person_4 : JUeRGEN 'S BETTER FORTUNE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa At length they reached `` Wendelskajn ,"
as person_7 is called in the old Norwegian and Icelandic writings.
In the south-west , a mile from the sea , lies Old person_7 ; and here dwelt merchant person_0 , and here person_9 was henceforth to dwell.
The old man 's wife and daughter , and his servants too , came rejoicingly to meet him.
There was a great pressing of hands , and talking , and questioning.
And the daughter , what a lovely face and bright eyes she had ! The interior of the house was roomy and comfortable.
person_9 found a happy home in Old person_7.
On the Sunday before her departure they all went to church , to the holy Communion.
The church was large and handsome , and had been built centuries before by Scotchmen and Hollanders ; it lay at a little distance from the town.
The sand had heaped itself up round the walls of the church ; but the graves were kept free from it.
It was the largest church north of the Limfjord.
After the sermon followed the holy Communion.
Two days later she left person_7 and went to Norway.
He stayed behind , and made himself useful in the house and in the business.
He went out fishing , and at that time fish were more plentiful and larger than now.
And so the autumn and the winter time passed away.
There was wealth here , and a real family life ; even down to the domestic animals , who were all well kept.
The kitchen glittered with copper and tin and white plates , and from the roof hung hams and beef , and winter stores in plenty.
In April a ship was to start for Norway , and person_9 was to sail in it.
He was full of life and spirits , and looked so stout and jovial that Dame person_0 declared it did her good to see him.
`` And it 's a pleasure to see you too , old wife ,"
said the old merchant.
`` person_9 has brought life into our winter evenings , and into you too , mother.
You look younger this year , and you seem well and bonny.
The sand-banks extend under the water a whole mile from the shore.
Yes , surely there she was ; and the ship was sailing up with person_9 and Clara on board.
The church and the lighthouse appeared to them as a heron and a swan rising from the blue waters.
For a plank in the ship gave way , and the water rushed in.
The crew flew to the pumps , and attempted to stop the leak.
A signal of distress was hoisted ; but they were still a full mile from the shore.
Fishing boats were in sight , but they were still far distant.
The wind blew shoreward , and the tide was in their favor too ; but all was insufficient , for the ship sank.
person_9 threw his right arm about Clara , and pressed her close to him.
He heard how Clara uttered a sigh , and felt a convulsive shudder pass through her , and he pressed her to him closer than ever.
person_9 had come in contact with this , and the tide had driven him against it with double force.
He sank down fainting with his load ; but the next wave lifted him and the young girl aloft again.
The fishermen grasped them , and lifted them into the boat.
And Clara lay pale and lifeless in the boat , that now made for the shore.
person_9 was still breathing.
The fishermen carried him into the nearest house upon the sand-hills.
The brain of the sick man was affected.
`` Let us pray that person_1 may take him to Himself ; he will never be a sane man again !"
person_9 remained in the house of the merchant person_0.
`` He contracted his illness in his endeavor to save our child ,"
said the old man , `` and now he is our son"
People called person_9 imbecile ; but that was not the right expression.
We may believe that he did not suffer , but his dark eyes lost their brightness , and looked only like black clouded glass.
`` Poor imbecile person_9 !"
said the people.
He it was whose life was to have been so pleasant that it would be `` presumption and pride"
to expect or believe in a higher existence hereafter.
All his great mental faculties had been lost ; only hard days , pain , and disappointment had been his lot.
He was like a rare plant torn from its native soil , and thrown upon the sand , to wither there.
And was the image , fashioned in person_1 's likeness , to have no better destination ? Was it to be merely the sport of chance ? No.
.
The all-loving person_1 would certainly repay him in the life to come , for what he had suffered and lost here.
`` The Lord is good to all ; and His mercy is over all His works"
In the churchyard where the sand blows across the walls , Clara lay buried.
Every Sunday he went with the old people to church , and sat silent there with vacant gaze.
He uttered her name , and became pale as death , and tears rolled over his cheeks.
`` Poor child !"
Yes , poor child -- a child still , and yet more than thirty years old ; for to that age person_9 had attained in Old person_7.
Merchant person_0 and his wife now rested here with their children , under the white sand.
It was spring-time , the season of storms.
from towards the Hunsby dunes.
One evening person_9 was sitting alone in the room.
`` Home ! home !"
he exclaimed.
No one heard him.
He went out of the house towards the dunes.
Sand and stones blew into his face and whirled around him.
The storm went howling over the town of person_7.
He thought he heard the sound of the organ , but it was the storm and the moaning of the sea.
as the old song said.
The married pair went on board , and the whole congregation with them , for there was room and joyfulness for all.
Full of blessedness and joy.
Hallelujah !"
And these words were the last that person_9 spoke in this world.
The next morning was Sunday , and the congregation and their pastor went forth to the service.
So they sang a psalm under the open sky , and went back to their homes.
person_9 was nowhere to be found in the town of person_7 , or in the dunes , however much they sought for him.
It was thought that the waves , which had rolled far up on the sand , had swept him away.
His body lay buried in a great sepulchre , in the church itself.
THE BISHOP OF BOeRGLUM AND HIS WARRIORS.
Our scene is in Northern person_5 , in the so called `` wild moor"
We hear what is called the `` Wester-wow-wow"
-- the peculiar roar of the North Sea as it breaks against the western coast of person_5.
It rolls and thunders with a sound that penetrates for miles into the land ; and we are quite near the roaring.
On this mountain of sand is a lofty old building -- the convent of person_2.
In one of its wings -LRB- the larger one -RRB- there is still a church.
And at this convent we now arrive in the late evening hour ; but the weather is clear in the bright June night around us.
We mount the winding staircase of stone , and march through the long passages under the heavy roof-beams.
The wind moans very strangely here , both within and without.
On the coast a ship is stranded ; and the bishop 's warriors are there , and spare not those whom the sea has spared.
The sea washes away the blood that has flowed from cloven skulls.
The stranded goods belong to the bishop , and there is a store of goods here.
There is plenty in the kitchen -- dead game and poultry , hams and sausages ; and fat fish swim in the ponds without.
The Bishop of person_2 is a mighty lord.
He has great possessions , but still he longs for more -- everything must bow before the mighty person_60.
His rich cousin at Thyland is dead , and his widow is to have the rich inheritance.
Her son was not at home.
In his boyhood he had already started on a journey , for his desire was to see foreign lands and strange people.
For years there had been no news of him.
Perhaps he had long been laid in the grave , and would never come back to his home to rule where his mother then ruled.
`` What has a woman to do with rule ?"
said the bishop.
Twice had icy winter returned before the bishop welcomed the horsemen and servants back to their home.
They came from Rome with a papal decree -- a ban , or bull , against the widow who had dared to offend the pious bishop.
`` Cursed be she , and all that belongs to her.
Let her be expelled from the congregation and the Church.
Let no man stretch forth a helping hand to her , and let friends and relations avoid her as a plague and a pestilence !"
`` What will not bend must break ,"
said the Bishop of person_2.
And all forsake the widow ; but she holds fast to her person_1.
He is her helper and defender.
`` Thou child of hell , I will yet carry out my purpose !"
cries the Bishop of person_2.
`` Now will I lay the hand of the Pope upon thee , to summon thee before the tribunal that shall condemn thee !"
-LRB- person_4 : JENS GLOB MEETS HIS MOTHER.
As a stranger she came into a foreign country , where a strange tongue was spoken and where new customs prevailed.
Farther and farther she journeyed , to where green hills rise into mountains , and the vine clothes their sides.
Strange merchants drive by her , and they look anxiously after their waggons laden with merchandise.
They fear an attack from the armed followers of the robber-knights.
The two poor women , in their humble vehicle drawn by two black oxen , travel fearlessly through the dangerous sunken road and through the darksome forest.
And now they were in Franconia.
And there met them a stalwart knight , with a train of twelve armed followers.
He paused , gazed at the strange vehicle , and questioned the women as to the goal of their journey and the place whence they came.
For the stranger knight is the widow 's son.
He seized her hand , he embraced her , and the mother wept.
For years she had not been able to weep , but had only bitten her lips till the blood started.
It is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships , and soon will icy winter come.
The sea rolled wine-tubs to the shore for the bishop 's cellar.
In the kitchen the deer roasted on the spit before the fire.
Jens person_10 laid a complaint against the bishop , and summoned him before the temporal and the spiritual court.
`` That will avail him little ,"
said the bishop.
`` Best leave off thy efforts , knight Jens"
Again it is the time of falling leaves , of stranded ships -- icy winter comes again , and the `` white bees"
are swarming , and sting the traveller 's face till they melt.
`` Keen weather to-day ,"
say the people , as they step in.
Jens person_10 stands so deeply wrapped in thought that he singes the skirt of his wide garment.
`` Thou person_2 bishop ,"
The bishop himself is to read the mass , and consequently will journey from person_2 to Thyland ; and this is known to Jens person_10.
Moorland and meadow are covered with ice and snow.
The marsh will bear horse and rider , the bishop with his priests , and armed men.
They ride the shortest way , through the waving reeds , where the wind moans sadly.
Blow thy brazen trumpet , thou trumpeter clad in foxskin ! it sounds merrily in the clear air.
The wind is blowing his trumpet too -- blowing it harder and harder.
He blows up a storm -- a terrible storm -- that increases more and more.
Towards the church they ride , as fast as they may through the storm.
The church stands firm , but the storm careers on over field and moorland , over land and sea.
person_2 's bishop reaches the church ; but person_6 will scarce do so , hard as he may ride.
The church is the judgment hall ; the altar is the council table.
The lights burn clear in the heavy brass candelabra.
The storm reads out the accusation and the sentence , roaming in the air over moor and heath , and over the rolling waters.
No ferry-boat can sail over the bay in such weather as this.
person_6 makes halt at Ottesworde.
There he dismisses his warriors , presents them with their horses and harness , and gives them leave to ride home and greet his wife.
The faithful warriors will not leave him , but follow him out into the deep waters.
Ten of them are carried away ; but person_6 and two of the youngest men reach the farther side.
They have still four miles to ride.
It is past midnight.
It is Christmas.
The wind has abated.
The church is lighted up ; the gleaming radiance shines through the window-frames , and pours out over meadow and heath.
The mass has long been finished , silence reigns in the church , and the wax is heard dropping from the candles to the stone pavement.
And now person_6 arrives.
In the forecourt Jens person_10 greets him kindly , and says , `` I have just made an agreement with the bishop"
`` Sayest thou so ?"
replied person_6.
`` Then neither thou nor the bishop shall quit this church alive"
`` Hold , brother ! First hear what the agreement was that I made.
I have slain the bishop and his warriors and priests.
They will have no word more to say in the matter , nor will I speak again of all the wrong that my mother has endured"
And four days afterwards the bells toll for a funeral in the convent of person_2.
The murdered bishop and the slain warriors and priests are displayed under a black canopy , surrounded by candelabra decked with crape.
There lies the dead man , in the black cloak wrought with silver ; the crosier in the powerless hand that was once so mighty.
The incense rises in clouds , and the monks chant the funeral hymn.
It is heard in the dark night by the frightened husbandman , driving by in the heavy sandy road past the convent of person_2.
It is heard by the sleepless listener in the thickly-walled rooms at person_2.
A storm approaches without , calling aloud for human lives.
The sea has not put on a new mind with the new time.
Sleep sweetly , if thou canst sleep ! Now it is morning.
The new time flings sunshine into the room.
The wind still keeps up mightily.
A wreck is announced -- as in the old time.
In comfortable rooms they encounter hospitality and friendly faces.
Then their anxieties are dispelled ; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at person_2.
Waltzes and Styrian dances are given , and Danish popular songs , and melodies of foreign lands in these modern times.
Once upon a time there was a child who was willful , and would not do at her mother wished.
The old man came , took a drink , and went away.
Three women were changed into flowers which grew in the field , but one of them was allowed to be in her own home at night.
And he did so.
