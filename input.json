eldest , `` Here we must separate , but on this day four years , we will meet each other again at this spot , and in the meantime we will seek our fortunes\"\n", "Then each of them went his way , and the eldest met a man who asked him where he was going , and what he was intending to do ? `` I want to learn a trade ,\"\n", "he replied.\n", "Then the other said , `` Come with me , and be a

replied.\n", "`` Then come with me , and be an astronomer ; there is nothing better than that , for nothing is hid from you\"\n", "He liked the idea , and became such a skillful astronomer that when he had learned everything , and was about to travel onwards , his master gave him a telescope and said to him , `` With that you canst thou see whatsoever takes place either on earth or in heaven ,

; `` sitting doubled up from morning till night , driving the needle and the goose backwards and forwards , is not to my taste\"\n", "`` Oh , but you are speaking in ignorance ,\"\n", "answered the man ; `` with me you would learn a very different kind of tailoring , which is respectable and proper , and for the most part very honorable\"\n", "When they parted , the man gave the youth a needle , and said , `` With this you can sew together whatever is given you , whether it is as soft as an egg or as hard as steel ; and it will all become one piece of stuff , so that no seam will be visible\"\n", "`` So now ,\"\n", "said he , quite delighted , `` the wind has blown you back again to me\"\n", "They told him of all that had happened to them , and that each had learned his own trade.\n", "Now they were sitting just in front of the house under a large tree , and the father said , `` I will put you all to the test , and see what you can do\"\n", "Then he looked up and said to his second son , `` Between two branches up at the top of this tree , there is a chaffinch 's nest , tell me how many eggs there are in it ?\"\n", "The astronomer took his glass , looked up , and said , `` There are five\"\n", "Then the father said to the eldest , `` Fetch the eggs down without disturbing the bird which is sitting hatching them\"\n", "The father took them , and put one of them on each corner of the table , and the fifth in the middle , and said to the huntsman , `` With one shot thou shalt shoot me the five eggs in two , through the middle\"\n", "The huntsman aimed , and shot the eggs , all five as the father had desired , and that at one shot.\n", "He certainly must have had some of the powder for shooting round corners.\n", "`` Now it 's your turn ,\"\n", "said the father to the fourth son ; `` you shall sew the eggs together again , and the young birds that are inside them as well , and you must do it so that they are not hurt by the shot\"\n", "The tailor

using your talents\"\n", "The four brothers said to each other , `` This would be a fine opportunity for us to show what we can do !\"\n", "and resolved to go forth together and liberate the King 's daughter.\n", "`` I will soon know where she is ,\"\n", "said the astronomer , and looked through his telescope and said , `` I see her already , she is far away from here on a rock in the sea , and the dragon is beside her watching her\"\n", "There the King 's daughter was sitting , and the dragon was lying asleep on her lap.\n", "The huntsman said , `` I dare not fire , I should kill the beautiful maiden at the same time\"\n", "`` Then I will try my art ,\"\n", "The monster fell down dead , but was so large and powerful that his fall shattered the whole ship.\n", "Fortunately , however , they laid hold of a couple of planks , and swam about the wide sea.\n", "When the King once more saw his daughter , there were great rejoicings.\n", "He said to the four brothers , `` One of you shall have her to wife , but which of you it is to be you must settle among yourselves\"\n", "Then a warm contest arose among them , for each of them preferred his own claim.\n", "The astronomer said , `` If I had not seen the princess , all your arts would have been useless , so she is mine\"\n", "The thief said , `` What would have been the use of your seeing , if I had not got her away from the dragon ? so she is mine\"\n", "The huntsman said , `` You and the princess , and all of you , would have been torn to pieces by the dragon if my ball had not hit him , so she is mine\"\n", "The tailor said , `` And if I , by my art , had not sewn the ship together again , you would all of you have been miserably drowned , so she is mine\"\n", "Then the King uttered this saying , `` Each of you has an equal right , and as all of you can not have the maiden , none of you shall have her , but I will give to each of you , as a reward , half a kingdom\"\n", "The brothers were pleased with this decision , and said , `` It is better thus than that we should be at variance with each other\"\n", "Then each of them received half a kingdom , and they lived with their father in the greatest happiness as long as it pleased God\"\n", "We 'll properly equip you as a belle , And I will certainly reward you well.\n", "TO gain but Phillis 's smiles , the Gascon said , He 'd with the very devil

sparrow had four young ones in a swallow 's nest.\n", "Little birds have to encounter great dangers !\"\n", "And then he asked the eldest where he had spent the summer , and how he had supported himself ? `` I stayed in the gardens , and looked for caterpillars and small worms , until the cherries got ripe\"\n", "`` Ah , my son ,\"\n", "said the father , `` tit-bits are not bad , but there is great risk about them ; on that account take great care of thyself henceforth , and particularly when people are going about the gardens who carry long green poles which are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top\"\n", "`` Yes , father , but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole with wax ?\"\n", "said the son.\n", "`` Where hast thou seen that ?\"\n", "`` In a merchant 's garden ,\"\n", "said the youngster.\n", "`` Oh , my son , merchant folks are quick folks ,\"\n", "said the father.\n", "`` If thou hast been among the children of the world , thou hast learned worldly shiftiness enough , only see that thou usest it well , and do not be too confident\"\n", "After this he asked the next , `` Where hast thou passed thy time ?\"\n", "`` At court ,\"\n", "said the son.\n", "`` Sparrows and silly little birds are of no use in that place -- there one finds much gold , velvet , silk , armor , harnesses , sparrow-hawks , screech-owls and hen-harriers ; keep to the
