Out of the book shot a clear beam , expanding into a thick stem , and into a mighty tree , which grew upward and spread its branches far over the student.\n", "Each leaf was fresh , and every blossom was a beautiful female head , some with dark sparkling eyes , others with wonderfully clear blue orbs ; every fruit was a gleaming star , and there was a glorious sound of song in the student 's room.\n", "Never had the little goblin imagined such splendor , far less had he ever seen or heard anything like it.\n", "He stood still on tiptoe , and peeped in till the light went out in the student 's garret.\n", "Probably the student blew it out , and went to bed ; but the little goblin remained standing there nevertheless , for the music still sounded on , soft and beautiful -- a splendid cradle song for the student who had lain down to rest.\n", "`` This is an incomparable place ,\"\n", "said the goblin : `` I never expected such a thing ! I should like to stay here with the student\"\n", "And then the little man thought it over -- and he was a sensible little man too -- but he sighed , `` The student has no porridge !\"\n", "And then he went down again to the huckster 's shop : and it was a very good thing that he got down there again at last , for the cask had almost worn out the good woman 's tongue , for it had spoken out at one side everything that was contained in it , and was just about turning itself over , to give it out from the other side also , when the goblin came in , and restored the tongue to its owner.\n", "But from that time forth the whole shop , from the cash-box down to the firewood , took its tone from the cask , and paid him such respect , and thought so much of him , that when the huckster afterwards read the critical articles on theatricals and art in the newspaper , they were all persuaded the information came from the cask itself.\n", "But the goblin could no longer sit quietly and contentedly listening to all the wisdom down there : so soon as the light glimmered from the garret in the evening he felt as if the rays were strong cables drawing him up , and he was obliged to go and peep through the keyhole ; and there a feeling of greatness rolled around him , such as we feel beside the ever-heaving sea when the storm rushes over it , and he burst into tears ! He did not know himself why he was weeping , but a peculiar feeling of pleasure mingled with his tears.\n", "How wonderfully glorious it must be to sit with the student under the same tree ! But that might not be , he was obliged to be content with the view through the keyhole , and to be glad of that.\n", "There he stood on the cold landing-place , with the autumn wind blowing down from the loft-hole : it was cold , very cold ; but the little mannikin only felt that when the light in the room was extinguished , and the tones in the tree died away.\n", "Ha ! then he shivered , and crept down again to his warm corner , where it was homely and comfortable.\n", "And when Christmas came , and brought with it the porridge and the great lump of butter , why , then he thought the huckster the better man.\n", "But in the middle of the night the goblin was awaked by a terrible tumult and beating against the window shutters.\n", "People rapped noisily without , and the watchman blew his horn , for a great fire had broken out -- the whole street was full of smoke and flame.\n", "Was it in the house itself , or at a neighbour 's ? Where was it ?

and now he ran up and away , quite on to the roof of the house , on to the chimney.\n", "There he sat , illuminated by the flames of the burning house opposite , both hands pressed tightly over his cap , in which the treasure lay ; and now he knew the real feelings of his heart , and knew to whom it really belonged.\n", "But when the fire was extinguished , and the goblin could think calmly again , why , then.\n", "`` I must divide myself between the two ,\"\n", "he said ; `` I ca n't quite give up the huckster , because of the porridge !\"\n", "Now , that was spoken quite like a human creature.\n", "We all of us visit the huckster for the sake of the porridge\"\n", "by Brothers Grimm A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through all the land.\n", "Nothing was hidden from him , and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air.\n", "But he had a strange custom ;

he was dismissed with no better answer.\n", "In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble.\n", "Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest ; and , whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills , they were having a confidential conversation together.\n", "The servant stood by and listened.\n", "They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning , and what good food they had found , and one said in a pitiful tone , `` Something lies heavy on my stomach ; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the Queen 's window\"\n", "The servant at once seized her by the neck , carried her to the kitchen , and said to the cook , `` Here is a fine duck ; pray , kill her\"\n", "`` Yes ,\"\n", "said the cook , and weighed her in his hand ; `` she has spared no trouble to fatten herself , and has been waiting to be roasted long enough\"\n", "So he cut off her head , and as she was being dressed for the spit , the Queen 's ring was found inside her.\n", "The servant could now easily prove his innocence ; and the person_0 , to make amends for the wrong , allowed him to ask a favor , and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for.\n", "The servant refused everything , and only asked for a horse and some money for traveling , as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little.\n", "When his request was granted he set out on his way , and one day came to a pond , where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water.\n", "Now , though it is said that fishes are dumb , he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably , and , as he had a kind heart , he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water.\n", "They quivered with delight , put out their heads , and cried to him , `` We will remember you and repay you for saving us !\"\n", "He rode on , and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet.\n", "He listened , and heard an ant-king complain , `` Why can not folks , with their clumsy beasts , keep off our bodies ?

the King , and told him the joyful tidings , and when the time was come she gave birth to a son , and the King was filled with gladness.\n", "Every morning she went with the child to the garden where

beasts.\n", "When the King saw the blood on her apron , he believed this , fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built , in which neither sun nor moon could be seen , and had his wife put into it , and walled up.\n", "Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink , and die of hunger.\n", "But God sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves , which flew to her twice a day , and carried her food until the seven years were over.\n", "The cook , however , thought to himself , `` If the child has the power of wishing , and I am here , he might very easily get me into trouble\"\n", "So he left the palace and went to the boy , who was already big enough to speak , and said to him , `` Wish for a beautiful palace for thyself with a garden , and all else that pertains to it\"\n", "Scarcely were the words out of the boy 's mouth , when everything was there that he had wished for.\n", "After a while the cook said to him , `` It is not well for thee to be so alone , wish for a pretty girl as a companion\"\n", "Then the King 's son wished for one , and she immediately stood before him , and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her.\n", "The two played together , and loved each other with all their hearts , and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman.\n", "The thought , however , occurred to him that the King 's son might some day wish to be with his father , and thus bring him into great peril.\n", "So he went out and took the maiden aside , and said , `` To-night when the boy is asleep , go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart , and bring me his heart and tongue , and if thou dost not do it , thou shalt lose thy life\"\n", "Thereupon he went away , and when he returned next day she had not done it , and said , `` Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed any one ?\"\n", "The cook once more said , `` If thou dost not do it , it shall cost thee thy own life\"\n", "When he had gone away , she had a little hind brought to her , and ordered her to be killed , and took her heart and tongue , and laid them on a plate , and when she saw the old man coming , she said to the boy , `` Lie down in thy bed , and draw the clothes over thee\"\n", "Then the wicked wretch came in and said , `` Where are the boy 's heart and tongue ?\"\n", "The girl reached the plate to

You with your short legs !\"\n", "said the hare , `` but for my part I am willing , if you have such a monstrous fancy for it.\n", "What shall we wager ?\"\n", "`` A golden louis-d ` or and a bottle of brandy ,\"\n", "said the hedgehog.\n", "`` Done ,\"\n", "said the hare.\n", "`` Shake hands on it , and then we may as well come off at once\"\n", "`` Nay ,\"\n", "said the hedgehog , `` there is no such great hurry ! I am still fasting , I will go home first , and have a little breakfast.\n", "In half-an-hour I will be back again at this place\"\n", "Hereupon the hedgehog departed , for the hare was quite satisfied with this.\n", "On his way the hedgehog thought to himself , `` The hare relies on his long legs , but I will contrive to get the better of him.\n", "He may be a great man , but he is a very silly fellow , and he shall pay for what he has said\"\n", "So when the hedgehog reached home , he said to his wife , `` Wife , dress thyself quickly , thou must go out to the field with me\"\n", "`` What is going on , then ?\"\n", "said his wife.\n", "`` I have made a wager with the hare , for a gold louis-d ` or and a bottle of brandy.\n", "I am to run a race with him , and thou must be present\"\n", "`` Good heavens , husband ,\"\n", "the wife now cried , `` art thou not right in thy mind , hast thou completely lost thy wits ? What can make thee want to run a race with the hare ?\"\n", "`` Hold thy tongue , woman ,\"\n", "said the hedgehog , `` that is my affair.\n", "Do n't begin to discuss things which are matters for men.\n", "Be off , dress thyself , and come with me\"\n", "What could the hedgehog 's wife do ? She was forced to obey him , whether she liked it or not.\n", "So when they had set out on their way together , the hedgehog said to his wife , `` Now pay attention to what I am going to say.\n", "Look you , I will make the long field our race-course.\n", "The hare shall run in one furrow , and I in another , and we will begin to run from the top.\n", "Now all that thou hast to do is to place thyself here below in the furrow , and when the hare arrives at the end of the furrow , on the other side of thee , thou must cry out to him , ` I am here already ! '\"\n", "Then they reached the field , and the hedgehog showed his wife her place , and then walked up the field.\n", "When he reached the top , the hare was already there.\n", "`` Shall we start ?\"\n", "said the hare.\n", "`` Certainly ,\"\n", "said the hedgehog.\n", "`` Then both at once\"\n", "So saying , each placed himself in his own furrow.\n", "The hare counted , `` Once , twice , thrice , and away !\"\n", "and went off like a whirlwind down the field.\n", "The hedgehog , however , only ran about three paces , and then he stooped down in the furrow , and stayed quietly where he was.\n", "When the hare therefore arrived in full career at the lower end of the field , the hedgehog 's wife met him with the cry , `` I am here already !\"\n", "The hare was shocked and wondered not a little , he thought no other than that it was the hedgehog himself who was calling to him , for the hedgehog 's wife looked just like her husband.\n", "The hare , however , thought to himself , `` That has not been done fairly ,\"\n", "and cried , `` It must be run again , let us have it again\"\n", "And once more he went off like the wind in a storm , so that he seemed to fly.\n", "But the hedgehog 's wife stayed quietly in her place.\n", "So when the hare reached the top of the field , the hedgehog himself cried out to him , `` I am here already\"\n", "The hare , however , quite beside himself with anger , cried , `` It must be run again , we must have it again\"\n", "`` All right ,\"\n", "answered the hedgehog , `` for my part we 'll run as often as you choose\"\n", "So the hare ran seventy-three times more , and the hedgehog always held out against him , and every time the hare reached either the top or the bottom , either the hedgehog or his wife said , `` I am here already\"\n", "At the seventy-fourth time , however , the hare could no longer reach the end.\n", "In the middle of the field he fell to the ground , blood streamed out of his mouth , and he lay dead on the spot.\n", "But the hedgehog took the louis-d ` or which he had won and the bottle of brandy , called his wife out of the furrow , and both went home together in great delight , and if they are not dead , they are living there still.\n", "This is how it happened that the hedgehog made the hare run races with him on the Buxtehuder heath till he died , and since that time no hare has ever had any fancy for running races with a Buxtehuder hedgehog.\n", "The moral of this story , however , is , firstly , that no one , however great he may be , should permit himself to jest at any one beneath him , even if he be only a hedgehog.\n", "And , secondly , it teaches , that when a man marries , he should take a wife in his own position , who looks just as he himself looks.\n", "So whosoever is a hedgehog let him see to it that his wife is a hedgehog also , and so forth\"\n", "Long , long ago there lived an old man and his wife who supported themselves by cultivating a small plot of land.\n", "Their life had been a very happy and peaceful one save for one great sorrow , and this was they had no child.\n", "Their only pet was a dog named person_1 , and on him they lavished all the affection of their old age.\n", "Indeed , they loved him so much that whenever they had anything nice to eat they denied themselves to give it to person_1.\n", "Now person_1 means `` white ,\"\n", "and he was so called because of his color.\n", "He was a real Japanese dog , and very like a small wolf in appearance.\n", "The happiest hour of the day both for the old man and his dog was when the man returned from his work in the field , and having finished his frugal supper of rice and vegetables , would take what he had saved from the meal out to the little veranda that ran round the cottage.\n", "Sure enough , person_1 was waiting for his master and the evening tit-bit.\n", "Then the old man said `` Chin , chin !\"\n", "and person_1 sat up and begged , and his master gave him the food.\n", "Next door to this good old couple there lived another old man and his wife who were both wicked and cruel , and who hated their good neighbors and the dog person_1 with all their might.\n", "Whenever person_1 happened to look into their kitchen they at once kicked him or threw something at him , sometimes even wounding him.\n", "One day person_1 was heard barking for a long time in the field at the back of his master 's house.\n", "The old man , thinking that perhaps some birds were attacking the corn , hurried out to see what was the matter.\n", "As soon as person_1 saw his master he ran to meet him , wagging his tail , and , seizing the end of his kimono , dragged him under a large yenoki tree.\n", "Here he began to dig very industriously with his paws , yelping with joy all the time.\n", "The old man , unable to understand what it all meant , stood looking on in bewilderment.\n", "But person_1 went on barking and digging with all his might.\n", "The thought that something might be hidden beneath the tree , and that the dog had scented it , at last struck the old man.\n", "He ran back to the house , fetched his spade and began to dig the ground at that spot.\n", "What was his astonishment when , after digging for some time , he came upon a heap of old and valuable coins , and the deeper he dug the more gold coins did he find.\n", "So intent was the old man on his work that he never saw the cross face of his neighbor peering at him through the bamboo hedge.\n", "At last all the gold coins lay shining on the ground.\n", "person_1 sat by erect with pride and looking fondly at his master as if to say , `` You see , though only a dog , I can make some return for all the kindness you show me\"\n", "The old man ran in to call his wife , and together they carried home the treasure.\n", "Thus in one day the poor old man became rich.\n", "His gratitude to the faithful dog knew no bounds , and he loved and petted him more than ever , if that were possible.\n", "The cross old neighbor , attracted by person_1 's barking , had been an unseen and envious witness of the finding of the treasure.\n", "He began to think that he , too , would like to find a fortune.\n", "So a few days later he called at the old man 's house and very ceremoniously asked permission to borrow person_1 for a short time.\n", "person_1 's master thought this a strange request , because he knew quite well that not only did his neighbor not love his pet dog , but that he never lost an opportunity of striking and tormenting him whenever the dog crossed his path.\n", "But the good old man was too kind-hearted to refuse his neighbor , so he consented to lend the dog on condition that he should be taken great care of.\n", "The wicked old man returned to his home with an evil smile on his face , and told his wife how he had succeeded in his crafty intentions.\n", "He then took his spade and hastened to his own field , forcing the unwilling person_1 to follow him.\n", "As soon as he reached a yenoki tree , he said to the dog , threateningly : `` If there were gold coins under your master 's tree , there must also be gold coins under my tree.\n", "You must find them for me ! Where are they ? Where ? Where ?\"\n", "And catching hold of person_1 's neck he held the dog 's head to the ground , so that person_1 began to scratch and dig in order to free himself from the horrid old man 's grasp.\n", "The old man was very pleased when he saw the dog begin to scratch and dig , for he at once supposed that some gold coins lay buried under his tree as well as under his neighbor 's , and that the dog had scented them as before ; so pushing person_1 away he began to dig himself , but there was nothing to be found.\n", "As he went on digging a foul smell was noticeable , and he at last came upon a refuse heap.\n", "The old man 's disgust can be imagined.\n", "This soon gave way to anger.\n", "He had seen his neighbor 's good fortune , and hoping for the same luck himself , he had borrowed the dog person_1 ; and now , just as he seemed on the point of finding what he sought , only a horrid smelling refuse heap had rewarded him for a morning 's digging.\n", "Instead of blaming his own greed for his disappointment , he blamed the poor dog.\n", "He seized his spade , and with all his strength struck person_1 and killed him on the spot.\n", "He then threw the dog 's body into the hole which he had dug in the hope of finding a treasure of gold coins , and covered it over with the earth.\n", "Then he returned to the house , telling no one , not even his wife , what be had done.\n", "After waiting several days , as the dog person_1 did not return , his master began to grow anxious.\n", "Day after day went by and the good old man waited in vain.\n", "Then he went to his neighbor and asked him to give him back his dog.\n", "Without any shame or hesitation , the wicked neighbor answered that he had killed person_1 because of his bad behavior.\n", "At this dreadful news person_1 's master wept many sad and bitter tears.\n", "Great indeed , was his woful surprise , but he was too good and gentle to reproach his bad neighbor.\n", "Learning that person_1 was buried under the yenoki tree in the field , he asked the old man to give him the tree , in remembrance of his poor dog person_1.\n", "Even the cross old neighbor could not refuse such a simple request , so he consented to give the old man the tree under which person_1 lay buried.\n", "person_1 's master then cut the tree down and carried it home.\n", "Out of the trunk he made a mortar.\n", "In this his wife put some rice , and he began to pound it with the intention of making a festival to the memory of his dog person_1.\n", "A strange thing happened ! His wife put the rice into the mortar , and no sooner had he begun to pound it to make the cakes , than it began to increase in quantity gradually till it was about five times the original amount , and the cakes were turned out of the mortar as if an invisible hand were at work.\n", "When the old man and his wife saw this , they understood that it was a reward to them from person_1 for their faithful love to him.\n", "They tasted the cakes and found them nicer than any other food.\n", "So from this time they never troubled about food , for they lived upon the cakes with which the mortar never ceased to supply them.\n", "The greedy neighbor , hearing of this new piece of good luck , was filled with envy as before , and called on the old man and asked leave to borrow the wonderful mortar for a short time , pretending that he , too , sorrowed for the death of person_1 , and wished to make cakes for a festival to the dog 's memory.\n", "The old man did not in the least wish to lend it to his cruel neighbor , but he was too kind to refuse.\n", "So the envious man carried home the mortar , but he never brought it back.\n", "Several days passed , and person_1 's master waited in vain for the mortar , so he went to call on the borrower , and asked him to be good enough to return the mortar if he had finished with it.\n", "He found him sitting by a big fire made of pieces of wood.\n", "On the ground lay what looked very much like pieces of a broken mortar.\n", "In answer to the old man 's inquiry , the wicked neighbor answered haughtily : `` Have you come to ask me for your mortar ? I broke it to pieces , and now I am making a fire of the wood , for when I tried to pound cakes in it only some horrid smelling stuff came out\"\n", "The good old man said : `` I am very sorry for that.\n", "It is a great pity you did not ask me for the cakes if you wanted them.\n", "I would have given you as many as ever you wanted.\n", "Now please give me the ashes of the mortar , as I wish to keep them in remembrance of my dog\"\n", "The neighbor consented at once , and the old man carried home a basket full of ashes.\n", "Not long after this the old man accidentally scattered some of the ashes made by the burning of the mortar on the trees of his garden.\n", "A wonderful thing happened !

"Next evening she took out the dress with the silver moons , and put a half-moon made of precious stones in her hair.\n", "When she appeared at the festival , all eyes were turned upon her , but the King 's son hastened to meet her , and filled with love for her , danced with her alone , and no longer so much as glanced at anyone else.\n", "Before she went away she was forced to promise him to come again to the festival on the last evening.\n", "When she appeared for the third time , she wore the star-dress which sparkled at every step she took , and her hair-ribbon and girdle were starred

idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched.\n", "`` I should like to live ,\"\n", "he said to himself , `` till I am five or six hundred years old at least , free from all sickness.\n", "The ordinary span of a man 's life is very short\"\n", "He wondered whether it were possible , by living simply and frugally henceforth , to prolong his life as long as he wished.\n", "He knew there were many stories in ancient history of emperors who had lived a thousand years , and there was a Princess of Yamato , who , it was said , lived to the age of five hundred This was the latest story of a very long life record.\n", "person_1 had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named Shin-no - Shiko.\n", "He was one of the most able and powerful rulers in Chinese history.\n", "He built all the large palaces , and also the famous great wall of China.\n", "He had everything in the world he could wish for , but in spite of all his happiness and the luxury and the splendor of his Court , the wisdom of his councilors and the glory of his reign , he was miserable because he knew that one day he must die and leave it all.\n", "When Shin-no-Shiko went to bed at night , when he rose in the morning , as he went through his day , the thought of death was always with him.\n", "He could not get away from it.\n", "Ah -- if only he could find the `` Elixir of person_2 ,\"\n", "he would be happy.\n", "The Emperor at last called a meeting of his courtiers and asked them all if they could not find for him the `` Elixir of person_2\"\n", "of which he had so often read and heard.\n", "One old courtier , person_0 by name , said that far away across the seas there was a country called Horaizan , and that certain hermits lived there who possessed the secret of the `` Elixir of person_2\"\n", "Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever.\n", "The Emperor ordered person_0 to set out for the land of Horaizan , to find the hermits , and to bring him back a phial of the magic elixir.\n", "He gave person_0 one of his best junks , fitted it out for him , and loaded it with great quantities of treasures and precious stones for person_0 to take as presents to the hermits.\n", "person_0 sailed for the land of Horaizan , but he never returned to the waiting Emperor ; but ever since that time Mount Fuji has been said to be the fabled Horaizan and the home of hermits who had the secret of the elixir , and person_0 has been worshiped as their patron god.\n", "Now person_1 determined to set out to find the hermits , and if he could , to become one , so that he might obtain the water of perpetual life.\n", "He remembered that as a child he had been told that not only did these hermits live on Mount Fuji , but that they were said to inhabit all the very high peaks.\n", "So he left his old home to the care of his relatives , and started out on his quest.\n", "He traveled through all the mountainous regions of the land , climbing to the tops of the highest peaks , but never a hermit did he find.\n", "At last , after wandering in an unknown region for many days , he met a hunter.\n", "`` Can you tell me ,\"\n", "asked person_1 , `` where the hermits live who have the Elixir of person_2 ?\"\n", "`` No\"\n", "said the hunter ; `` I ca n't tell you where such hermits live , but there is a notorious robber living in these parts.\n", "It is said that he is chief of a band of two hundred followers\"\n", "This odd answer irritated person_1 very much , and he thought how foolish it was to waste more time in looking for the hermits in this way , so he decided to go at once to the shrine of person_0 , who is worshiped as the patron god of the hermits in the south of Japan.\n", "person_1 reached the shrine and prayed for seven days , entreating person_0 to show him the way to a hermit who could give him what he wanted so much to find.\n", "At midnight of the seventh day , as person_1 knelt in the temple , the door of the innermost shrine flew open , and person_0 appeared in a luminous cloud , and calling to person_1 to come nearer , spoke thus : `` Your desire is a very selfish one and can not be easily granted.\n", "You think that you would like to become a hermit so as to find the Elixir of person_2.\n", "Do you know how hard a hermit 's life is ? A hermit is only allowed to eat fruit and berries and the bark of pine trees ; a hermit must cut himself off from the world so that his heart may become as pure as gold and free from every earthly desire.\n", "Gradually after following these strict rules , the hermit ceases to feel hunger or cold or heat , and his body becomes so light that he can ride on a crane or a carp , and can walk on water without getting his feet wet\"\n", "`` You , person_1 , are fond of good living and of every comfort.\n", "You are not even like an ordinary man , for you are exceptionally idle , and more sensitive to heat and cold than most people.\n", "You would never be able to go barefoot or to wear only one thin dress in the winter time ! Do you think that you would ever have the patience or the endurance to live a hermit 's life ?\"\n", "`` In answer to your prayer , however , I will help you in another way.\n", "I will send you to the country of Perpetual person_2 , where death never comes -- where the people live forever !\"\n", "Saying this , person_0 put into person_1 's hand a little crane made of paper , telling him to sit on its back and it would carry him there.\n", "person_1 obeyed wonderingly.\n", "The crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort.\n", "It then spread its wings , rose high in the air , and flew away over the mountains right out to sea.\n", "person_1 was at first quite frightened ; but by degrees he grew accustomed to the swift flight through the air.\n", "On and on they went for thousands of miles.\n", "The bird never stopped for rest or food , but as it was a paper bird it doubtless did not require any nourishment , and strange to say , neither did person_1.\n", "After several days they reached an island.\n", "The crane flew some distance inland and then alighted.\n", "As soon as person_1 got down from the bird 's back , the crane folded up of its own accord and flew into his pocket.\n", "Now person_1 began to look about him wonderingly , curious to see what the country of Perpetual person_2 was like.\n", "He walked first round about the country and then through the town.\n", "Everything was , of course , quite strange , and different from his own land.\n", "But both the land and the people seemed prosperous , so he decided that it would be good for him to stay there and took up lodgings at one of the hotels.\n", "The proprietor was a kind man , and when person_1 told him that he was a stranger and had come to live there , he promised to arrange everything that was necessary with the governor of the city concerning person_1 's sojourn there.\n", "He even found a house for his guest , and in this way person_1 obtained his great wish and became a resident in the country of Perpetual person_2.\n", "Within the memory of all the islanders no man had ever died there , and sickness was a thing unknown.\n", "Priests had come over from India and China and told them of a beautiful country called Paradise , where happiness and bliss and contentment fill all men 's hearts , but its gates could only be reached by dying.\n", "This tradition was handed down for ages from generation to generation -- but none knew exactly what death was except that it led to Paradise.\n", "Quite unlike person_1 and other ordinary people , instead of having a great dread of death , they all , both rich and poor , longed for it as something good and desirable.\n", "They were all tired of their long , long lives , and longed to go to the happy land of contentment called Paradise of which the priests had told them centuries ago.\n", "All this person_1 soon found out by talking to the islanders.\n", "He found himself , according to his ideas , in the land of Topsyturvydom.\n", "Everything was upside down.\n", "He had wished to escape from dying.\n", "He had come to the land of Perpetual person_2 with great relief and joy , only to find that the inhabitants themselves , doomed never to die , would consider it bliss to find death.\n", "What he had hitherto considered poison these people ate as good food , and all the things to which he had been accustomed as food they rejected.\n", "Whenever any merchants from other countries arrived , the rich people rushed to them eager to buy poisons.\n", "These they swallowed eagerly , hoping for death to come so that they might go to Paradise.\n", "But what were deadly poisons in other lands were without effect in this strange place , and people who swallowed them with the hope of dying , only found that in a short time they felt better in health instead of worse.\n", "Vainly they tried to imagine what death could be like.\n", "The wealthy would have given all their money and all their goods if they could but shorten their lives to two or three hundred years even.\n", "Without any change to live on forever seemed to this people wearisome and sad.\n", "In the chemist shops there was a drug which was in constant demand , because after using it for a hundred years , it was supposed to turn the hair slightly gray and to bring about disorders of the stomach.\n", "person_1 was astonished to find that the poisonous globe-fish was served up in restaurants as a delectable dish , and hawkers in the streets went about selling sauces made of Spanish flies.\n", "He never saw any one ill after eating these horrible things , nor did he ever see any one with as much as a cold.\n", "person_1 was delighted.\n", "He said to himself that he would never grow tired of living , and that he considered it profane to wish for death.\n", "He was the only happy man on the island.\n", "For his part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy life.\n", "He set himself up in business , and for the present never even dreamed of going back to his native land.\n", "As years went by , however , things did not go as smoothly as at first.\n", "He had heavy losses in business , and several times some affairs went wrong with his neighbors.\n", "This caused him great annoyance.\n", "Time passed like the flight of an arrow for him , for he was busy from morning till night.\n", "Three hundred years went by in this monotonous way , and then at last he began to grow tired of life in this country , and he longed to see his own land and his old home.\n", "However long he lived here , life would always be the game , so was it not foolish and wearisome to stay on here forever ? person_1 , in his wish to escape from the country of Perpetual person_2 , recollected person_0 , who had helped him before when he was wishing to escape from death -- and he prayed to the saint to bring him back to his own land again.\n", "No sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket.\n", "person_1 was amazed to see that it had remained undamaged after all these years.\n", "Once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it.\n", "As he did so , the bird spread its wings and flew , swiftly out across the sea in the direction of Japan.\n", "Such was the willfulness of the man 's nature that he looked back and regretted all he had left behind.\n", "He tried to stop the bird in vain.\n", "The crane held on its way for thousands of miles across the ocean.\n", "Then a storm came on , and the wonderful paper crane got damp , crumpled up , and fell into the sea.\n", "person_1 fell with it.\n", "Very much frightened at the thought of being drowned , he cried out loudly to person_0 to save him.\n", "He looked round , but there was no ship in sight.\n", "He swallowed a quantity of sea-water , which only increased his miserable plight.\n", "While he was thus struggling to keep himself afloat , he saw a monstrous shark swimming towards him.\n", "As it came nearer it opened its huge mouth ready to devour him.\n", "person_1 was all but paralyzed with fear now that he felt his end so near , and screamed out as loudly as ever he could to person_0 to come and rescue him.\n", "Lo , and behold , person_1 was awakened by his own screams , to find that during his long prayer he had fallen asleep before the shrine , and that all his extraordinary and frightful adventures had been only a wild dream.\n", "He was in a cold perspiration with fright , and utterly bewildered.\n", "Suddenly a bright light came towards him , and in the light stood a messenger.\n", "The messenger held a book in his hand , and spoke to person_1 : `` I am sent to you by person_0 , who in answer to your prayer , has permitted you in a dream to see the land of Perpetual person_2.\n", "But you grew weary of living there , and begged to be allowed to return to your native land so that you might die.\n", "person_0 , so that he might try you , allowed you to drop into the sea , and then sent a shark to swallow you up.\n", "Your desire for death was not real , for even at that moment you cried out loudly and shouted for help\"\n", "`` It is also vain for you to wish to become a hermit , or to find the Elixir of person_2.\n", "These things are not for such as you -- your life is not austere enough.\n", "It is best for you to go back to your paternal home , and to live a good and industrious life.\n", "Never neglect to keep the anniversaries of your ancestors , and make it your duty to provide for your children 's future.\n", "Thus will you live to a good old age and be happy , but give up the vain desire to escape death , for no man can do that , and by this time you have surely found out that even when selfish desires are granted they do not bring happiness\"\n", "`` In this book I give you there are many precepts good for you to know -- if you study them , you will be guided in the way I have pointed out to you\"\n", "The angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking , and person_1 took the lesson to heart.\n", "With the book in his hand he returned to his old home , and giving up all his old vain wishes , tried to live a good and useful life and to observe the lessons taught him in the book , and he and his house prospered henceforth\"\n", "There were once three brothers who had fallen deeper and deeper into poverty , and at last their need was so great that they had to endure hunger , and had nothing to eat or drink.\n", "Then said they , `` We can not go on thus , we had better go into the world and seek our fortune\"\n", "They therefore set out , and had already walked over many a long road and many a blade of grass , but had not yet met with good luck.\n", "One day they arrived in a great forest , and in the midst of it was a hill , and when they came nearer they saw that the hill was all silver.\n", "Then spoke the eldest , `` Now I have found the good luck I wished for , and I desire nothing more\"\n", "He took as much of the silver as he could possibly carry , and then turned back and went home again.\n", "But the two others said , `` We want something more from good luck than mere silver ,\"\n", "and did not touch it , but went onwards.\n", "After they had walked for two days longer without stopping , they came to a hill which was all gold.\n", "The second brother stopped , took thought with himself , and was undecided.\n", "`` What shall I do ?\"\n", "said he ; `` shall I take for myself so much of this gold , that I have sufficient for all the rest of my life , or shall I go farther ?\"\n", "At length he made a decision , and putting as much into his pockets as would go in , said farewell to his brother , and went home.\n", "But the third said , `` Silver and gold do not move me , I will not renounce my chance of fortune , perhaps something better still will be given me\"\n", "He journeyed onwards , and when he had walked for three days , he got into a forest which was still larger than the one before , and never would come to an end , and as he found nothing to eat or to drink , he was all but exhausted.\n", "Then he climbed up a high tree to find out if up there he could see the end of the forest , but so far as his eye could pierce he saw nothing but the tops of trees.\n", "Then he began to descend the tree again , but hunger tormented him , and he thought to himself , `` If I could but eat my fill once more !\"\n", "When he got down he saw with astonishment a table beneath the tree richly spread with food , the steam of which rose up to meet him.\n", "`` This time ,\"\n", "said he , `` my wish has been fulfilled at the right moment\"\n", "And without inquiring who had brought the food , or who had cooked it , he approached the table , and ate with enjoyment until he had appeased his hunger.\n", "When he was done , he thought , `` It would after all be a pity if the pretty little table-cloth were to be spoilt in the forest here ,\"\n", "and folded it up tidily and put it in his pocket.\n", "Then he went onwards , and in the evening , when hunger once more made itself felt , he wanted to make a trial of his little cloth , and spread it out and said , `` I wish thee to be covered with good cheer again ,\"\n", "and scarcely had the wish crossed his lips than as many dishes with the most exquisite food on them stood on the table as there was room for.\n", "`` Now I perceive ,\"\n", "said he , `` in what kitchen my cooking is done.\n", "Thou shalt be dearer to me than the mountains of silver and gold\"\n", "For he saw plainly that it was a wishing-cloth.\n", "The cloth , however , was still not enough to enable him to sit down quietly at home ; he preferred to wander about the world and pursue his fortune farther.\n", "One night he met , in a lonely wood , a dusty , black charcoal-burner , who was burning charcoal there , and had some potatoes by the fire , on which he was going to make a meal.\n", "`` Good evening , blackbird !\"\n", "said the youth.\n", "`` How dost thou get on in thy solitude ?\"\n", "`` One day is like another ,\"\n", "replied the charcoal-burner , `` and every night potatoes ! Hast thou a mind to have some , and wilt thou be my guest ?\"\n", "`` Many thanks ,\"\n", "replied the traveler , `` I wo n't rob thee of thy supper ; thou didst not reckon on a visitor , but if thou wilt put up with what I have , thou shalt have an invitation\"\n", "`` Who is to prepare it for thee ?\"\n", "said the charcoal-burner.\n", "`` I see that thou hast nothing with thee , and there is no one within a two hours ' walk who could give thee anything\"\n", "`` And yet there shall be a meal ,\"\n", "answered the youth , `` and better than any thou hast ever tasted\"\n", "Thereupon he brought his cloth out of his knapsack , spread it on the ground , and said , `` Little cloth , cover thyself ,\"\n", "and instantly boiled meat and baked meat stood there , and as hot as if it had just come out of the kitchen.\n", "The charcoal-burner stared , but did not require much pressing ; he fell to , and thrust larger and larger mouthfuls into his black mouth.\n", "When they had eaten everything , the charcoal-burner smiled contentedly , and said , `` Hark thee , thy table-cloth has my approval ; it would be a fine thing for me in this forest , where no one ever cooks me anything good.\n", "I will propose an exchange to thee ; there in the corner hangs a soldier 's knapsack , which is certainly old and shabby , but in it lie concealed wonderful powers ; but , as I no longer use it , I will give it to thee for the table-cloth\"\n", "`` I must first know what these wonderful powers are ,\"\n", "answered the youth.\n", "`` That will I tell thee ,\"\n", "replied the charcoal-burner ; `` every time thou tappest it with thy hand , a corporal comes with six men armed from head to foot , and they do whatsoever thou commandest them\"\n", "`` So far as I am concerned ,\"\n", "said the youth , `` if nothing else can be done , we will exchange ,\"\n", "and he gave the charcoal-burner the cloth , took the knapsack from the hook , put it on , and bade farewell.\n", "When he had walked a while , he wished to make a trial of the magical powers of his knapsack and tapped it.\n", "Immediately the seven warriors stepped up to him , and the corporal said , `` What does my lord and ruler wish for ?\"\n", "`` March with all speed to the charcoal-burner , and demand my wishing-cloth back\"\n", "They faced to the left , and it was not long before they brought what he required , and had taken it from the charcoal-burner without asking many questions.\n", "The young man bade them retire , went onwards , and hoped fortune would shine yet more brightly on him.\n", "By sunset he came to another charcoal-burner , who was making his supper ready by the fire.\n", "`` If thou wilt eat some potatoes with salt , but with no dripping , come and sit down with me ,\"\n", "said the sooty fellow.\n", "`` No , he replied , this time thou shalt be my guest ,\"\n", "and he spread out his cloth , which was instantly covered with the most beautiful dishes.\n", "They ate and drank together , and enjoyed themselves heartily.\n", "After the meal was over , the charcoal-burner said , `` Up there on that shelf lies a little old worn-out hat which has strange properties : when any one puts it on , and turns it round on his head , the cannons go off as if twelve were fired all together , and they shoot down everything so that no one can withstand them.\n", "The hat is of no use to me , and I will willingly give it for thy table-cloth\"\n", "`` That suits me very well ,\"\n", "he answered , took the hat , put it on , and left his table-cloth behind him.\n", "Hardly , however , had he walked away than he tapped on his knapsack , and his soldiers had to fetch the cloth back again.\n", "`` One thing comes on the top of another ,\"\n", "thought he , `` and I feel as if my luck had not yet come to an end\"\n", "Neither had his thoughts deceived him.\n", "After he had walked on for the whole of one day , he came to a third charcoal-burner , who like the previous ones , invited him to potatoes without dripping.\n", "But he let him also dine with him from his wishing-cloth , and the charcoal-burner liked it so well , that at last he offered him a horn for it , which had very different properties from those of the hat.\n", "When any one blew it all the walls and fortifications fell down , and all towns and villages became ruins.\n", "He certainly gave the charcoal-burner the cloth for it , but he afterwards sent his soldiers to demand it back again , so that at length he had the knapsack , hat and horn , all three.\n", "`` Now ,\"\n", "said he , `` I am a made man , and it is time for me to go home and see how my brothers are getting on\"\n", "When he reached home , his brothers had built themselves a handsome house with their silver and gold , and were living in clover.\n", "He went to see them , but as he came in a ragged coat , with his shabby hat on his head , and his old knapsack on his back , they would not acknowledge him as their brother.\n", "They mocked and said , `` Thou givest out that thou art our brother who despised silver and gold , and craved for something still better for himself.\n", "He will come in his carriage in full splendor like a mighty king , not like a beggar ,\"\n", "and they drove him out of doors.\n", "Then he fell into a rage , and tapped his knapsack until a hundred and fifty men stood before him armed from head to foot.\n", "He commanded them to surround his brothers ' house , and two of them were to take hazel-sticks with them , and beat the two insolent men until they knew who he was.\n", "A violent disturbance arose , people ran together , and wanted to lend the two some help in their need , but against the soldiers they could do nothing.\n", "News of this at length came to the King , who was very angry , and ordered a captain to march out with his troop , and drive this disturber of the peace out of the town ; but the man with the knapsack soon got a greater body of men together , who repulsed the captain and his men , so that they were forced to retire with bloody noses.\n", "The King said , `` This vagabond is not brought to order yet ,\"\n", "and next day sent a still larger troop against him , but they could do even less.\n", "The youth set still more men against them , and in order to be done the sooner , he turned his hat twice round on his head , and heavy guns began to play , and the king 's men were beaten and put to flight.\n", "`` And now ,\"\n", "said he , `` I will not make peace until the King gives me his daughter to wife , and I govern the whole kingdom in his name\"\n", "He caused this to be announced to the King , and the latter said to his daughter , `` Necessity is a hard nut to crack , what remains to me but to do what he desires ? If I want peace and to keep the crown on my head , I must give thee away\"\n", "So the wedding was celebrated , but the King 's daughter was vexed that her husband should be a common man , who wore a shabby hat , and put on an old knapsack.\n", "She wished much to get rid of him , and night and day studied how she could accomplished this.\n", "Then she thought to herself , `` Is it possible that his wonderful powers lie in the knapsack ?\"\n", "and she dissembled and caressed him , and when his heart was softened , she said , `` If thou wouldst but lay aside that ugly knapsack , it makes disfigures thee so , that I ca n't help being ashamed of thee\"\n", "`` Dear child ,\"\n", "said he , `` this knapsack is my greatest treasure ; as long as I have it , there is no power on earth that I am afraid of\"\n", "And he revealed to her the wonderful virtue with which it was endowed.\n", "Then she threw herself in his arms as if she were going to kiss him , but dexterously took the knapsack off his shoulders , and ran away with it.\n", "As soon as she was alone she tapped it , and commanded the warriors to seize their former master , and take him out of the royal palace.\n", "They obeyed , and the false wife sent still more men after him , who were to drive him quite out of the country.\n", "Then he would have been ruined if he had not had the little hat.\n", "But his hands were scarcely at liberty before he turned it twice.\n", "Immediately the cannon began to thunder , and struck down everything , and the King 's daughter herself was forced to come and beg for mercy.\n", "As she entreated in such moving terms , and promised amendment , he allowed himself to be persuaded and granted her peace.\n", "She behaved in a friendly manner to him , and acted as if she loved him very much , and after some time managed so to befool him , that he confided to her that even if someone got the knapsack into his power , he could do nothing against him so long as the old hat was still his.\n", "When she knew the secret , she waited until he was asleep , and then she took the hat away from him , and had it thrown out into the street.\n", "But the horn still remained to him , and in great anger he blew it with all his strength.\n", "Instantly all walls , fortifications , towns , and villages , toppled down , and crushed the King and his daughter to death.\n", "And had he not put down the horn and had blown just a little longer , everything would have been in ruins , and not one stone would have been left standing on another.\n", "Then no one opposed him any longer , and he made himself King of the whole country\"\n", "Long , long ago , one bright autumn day in Japan , it happened , that a pink-faced monkey and a yellow crab were playing together along the bank of a river.\n", "As they were running about , the crab found a rice - dumpling and the monkey a persimmon-seed.\n", "The crab picked up the rice-dumpling and showed it to the monkey , saying : `` Look what a nice thing I have found !\"\n", "Then the monkey held up his persimmon-seed and said : `` I also have found something good ! Look !\"\n", "Now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit , he had no use for the seed he had just found.\n", "The persimmon-seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone.\n", "He , therefore , in his greedy nature , felt very envious of the crab 's nice dumpling , and he proposed an exchange.\n", "The crab naturally did not see why he should give up his prize for a hard stone-like seed , and would not consent to the monkey 's proposition.\n", "Then the cunning monkey began to persuade the crab , saying : `` How unwise you are not to think of the future ! Your rice-dumpling can be eaten now , and is certainly much bigger than my seed ; but if you sow this seed in the ground it will soon grow and become a great tree in a few years , and bear an abundance of fine ripe persimmons year after year.\n", "If only I could show it to you then with the yellow fruit hanging on its branches ! Of course , if you do n't believe me I shall sow it myself ; though I am sure , later on , you will be very sorry that you did not take my advice\"\n", "The simple-minded crab could not resist the monkey 's clever persuasion.\n", "He at last gave in and consented to the monkey 's proposal , and the exchange was made.\n", "The greedy monkey soon gobbled up the dumpling , and with great reluctance gave up the persimmon - seed to the crab.\n", "He would have liked to keep that too , but he was afraid of making the crab angry and of being pinched by his sharp scissor-like claws.\n", "They then separated , the monkey going home to his forest trees and the crab to his stones along the river-side.\n", "As soon as the crab reached home he put the persimmon-seed in the ground as the monkey had told him.\n", "In the following spring the crab was delighted to see the shoot of a young tree push its way up through the ground.\n", "Each year it grew bigger , till at last it blossomed one spring , and in the following autumn bore some fine large persimmons.\n", "Among the broad smooth green leaves the fruit hung like golden balls , and as they ripened they mellowed to a deep orange.\n", "It was the little crab 's pleasure to go out day by day and sit in the sun and put out his long eyes in the same way as a snail puts out its horn , and watch the persimmons ripening to perfection.\n", "`` How delicious they will be to eat !\"\n", "he said to himself.\n", "At last , one day , he knew the persimmons must be quite ripe and he wanted very much to taste one.\n", "He made several attempts to climb the tree , in the vain hope of reaching one of the beautiful persimmons hanging above him ;

If we allow her to come here , we shall suffer for it some day\"\n", "But the other sisters would answer , `` Be quiet , Balna ; why must you always be quarrelling with this poor woman ? Let her take some fire if she likes\"\n", "Then the Prudhan 's widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it ; and whilst no one was looking , she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared for the person_0 's dinner.\n", "Now the person_0 was very fond of his daughters.\n", "Ever since their mother 's death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands , in order to avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies.\n", "So , when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner , he thought it must arise from their carelessness , as it did not seem likely that any one should have put mud there on purpose ; but being very kind he did not like to reprove them for it , although this spoiling of the curry was repeated many successive days.\n", "At last , one day , he determined to hide , and watch his daughters cooking , and see how it all happened ; so he went into the next room , and watched them through a hole in the wall.\n", "There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the curry , and as each dish was completed , they put it by the fire ready to be cooked.\n", "Next he noticed the Prudhan 's widow come to the door , and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with.\n", "Balna turned to her , angrily , and said , `` Why do n't you keep fuel in your own house , and not come here every day and take ours ? Sisters , do n't give this woman any more wood ; let her buy it for herself\"\n", "Then the eldest sister answered , `` Balna , let the poor woman take the wood and the fire ; she does us no harm\"\n", "But Balna replied , `` If you let her come here so often , maybe she will do us some harm , and make us sorry for it , some day\"\n", "The person_0 then saw the Prudhan 's widow go to the place where all his dinner was nicely prepared , and , as she took the wood , she threw a little mud into each of the dishes.\n", "At this he was very angry , and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him.\n", "But when the widow came , she told him that she had played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him ; and she spoke so cleverly , and pleased him so well with her cunning words , that instead of punishing her , the person_0 married her , and made her his Ranee , and she and her daughter came to live in the palace.\n", "Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor person_3sses , and wanted to get them , if possible , out of the way , in order that her daughter might have all their riches , and live in the palace as person_3ss in their place ; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her , she did all she could to make them miserable.\n", "She gave them nothing but bread to eat , and very little of that , and very little water to drink ; so these seven poor little person_3sses , who had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them , and good food and good clothes all their lives long , were very miserable and unhappy ; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother 's tomb and cry -- and say : `` Oh mother , mother , can not you see your poor children , how unhappy we are , and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother ?\"\n", "One day , whilst they were thus sobbing and crying , lo and behold ! a beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave , covered with fresh ripe pomeloes , and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit , and every day after this , instead of trying to eat the bad dinner their step-mother provided for them , they used to go out to their mother 's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the beautiful tree.\n", "Then the Ranee said to her daughter , `` I can not tell how it is , every day those seven girls say they do n't want any dinner , and wo n't eat any ; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill ; they look better than you do.\n", "I can not tell how it is\"\n", "And she bade her watch the seven person_3sses , and see if any one gave them anything to eat.\n", "So next day , when the person_3sses went to their mother 's grave , and were eating the beautiful pomeloes , the Prudhan 's daughter followed them , and saw them gathering the fruit.\n", "Then Balna said to her sisters , `` Do you not see that girl watching us ? Let us drive her away , or hide the pomeloes , else she will go and tell her mother all about it , and that will be very bad for us\"\n", "But the other sisters said , `` Oh no , do not be unkind , Balna.\n", "The girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother.\n", "Let us rather invite her to come and have some of the fruit\"\n", "And calling her to them , they gave her one of the pomeloes.\n", "No sooner had she eaten it , however , than the Prudhan 's daughter went home and said to her mother , `` I do not wonder the seven person_3sses will not eat the dinner you prepare for them , for by their mother 's grave there grows a beautiful pomelo tree , and they go there every day and eat the pomeloes.\n", "I ate one , and it was the nicest I have ever tasted\"\n", "The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this , and all next day she stayed in her room , and told the person_0 that she had a very bad headache.\n", "The person_0 was deeply grieved , and said to his wife , `` What can I do for you ?\"\n", "She answered , `` There is only one thing that will make my headache well.\n", "By your dead wife 's tomb there grows a fine pomelo tree ; you must bring that here , and boil it , root and branch , and put a little of the water in which it has been boiled , on my forehead , and that will cure my headache\"\n", "So the person_0 sent his servants , and had the beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots , and did as the Ranee desired ; and when some of the water , in which it had been boiled , was put on her forehead , she said her headache was gone and she felt quite well.\n", "Next day , when the seven person_3sses went as usual to the grave of their mother , the pomelo tree had disappeared.\n", "Then they all began to cry very bitterly.\n", "Now there was by the Ranee 's tomb a small tank , and as they were crying they saw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance , which quickly hardened into a thick white cake.\n", "At seeing this all the person_3sses were very glad , and they ate some of the cake , and liked it ; and next day the same thing happened , and so it went on for many days.\n", "Every morning the person_3sses went to their mother 's grave , and found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake.\n", "Then the cruel step-mother said to her daughter : `` I can not tell how it is , I have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee 's grave destroyed , and yet the person_3sses grow no thinner , nor look more sad , though they never eat the dinner I give them.\n", "I can not tell how it is !\"\n", "And her daughter said , `` I will watch\"\n", "Next day , while the person_3sses were eating the cream cake , who should come by but their step-mother 's daughter.\n", "Balna saw her first , and said , `` See , sisters , there comes that girl again.\n", "Let us sit round the edge of the tank and not allow her to see it , for if we give her some of our cake , she will go and tell her mother ; and that will be very unfortunate for us\"\n", "The other sisters , however , thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious , and instead of following her advice , they gave the Prudhan 's daughter some of the cake , and she went home and told her mother all about it.\n", "The Ranee , on hearing how well the person_3sses fared , was exceedingly angry , and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee 's tomb , and fill the little tank with the ruins.\n", "And not content with this , she next day pretended to be very , very ill -- in fact , at the point of death -- and when the person_0 was much grieved , and asked her whether it was in his power to procure her any remedy , she said to him : `` Only one thing can save my life , but I know you will not do it\"\n", "He replied , `` Yes , whatever it is , I will do it\"\n", "She then said , `` To save my life , you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife , and put some of their blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands , and their death will be my life\"\n", "At these words the person_0 was very sorrowful ; but because he feared to break his word , he went out with a heavy heart to find his daughters.\n", "He found them crying by the ruins of their mother 's grave.\n", "Then , feeling he could not kill them , the person_0 spoke kindly to them , and told them to come out into the jungle with him ; and there he made a fire and cooked some rice , and gave it to them.\n", "But in the afternoon , it being very hot , the seven person_3sses all fell asleep , and when he saw they were fast asleep , the person_0 , their father , stole away and left them -LRB- for he feared his wife -RRB- , saying to himself : `` It is better my poor daughters should die here , than be killed by their step-mother\"\n", "He then shot a deer , and returning home , put some of its blood on the forehead and hands of the Ranee , and she thought then that he had really killed the person_3sses , and said she felt quite well.\n", "Meantime the seven person_3sses awoke , and when they found themselves all alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened , and began to call out as loud as they could , in hopes of making their father hear ; but he was by that time far away , and would not have been able to hear them even had their voices been as loud as thunder.\n", "It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighbouring person_0 chanced to be hunting in that same jungle , and as they were returning home , after the day 's sport was over , the youngest person_3 said to his brothers `` Stop , I think I hear some one crying and calling out.\n", "Do you not hear voices ? Let us go in the direction of the sound , and find out what it is\"\n", "So the seven person_3s rode through the wood until they came to the place where the seven person_3sses sat crying and wringing their hands.\n", "At the sight of them the young person_3s were very much astonished , and still more so on learning their story ; and they settled that each should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him , and marry her.\n", "So the first and eldest person_3 took the eldest person_3ss home with him , and married her.\n", "And the second took the second ; And the third took the third ; And the fourth took the fourth ; And the fifth took the fifth ; And the sixth took the sixth ; And the seventh , and the handsomest of all , took the beautiful Balna.\n", "And when they got to their own land , there was great rejoicing throughout the kingdom , at the marriage of the seven young person_3s to seven such beautiful person_3sses.\n", "About a year after this Balna had a little son , and his uncles and aunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers and seven mothers.\n", "None of the other person_3s and person_3sses had any children , so the son of the seventh person_3 and Balna was acknowledged their heir by all the rest.\n", "They had thus lived very happily for some time , when one fine day the seventh person_3 -LRB- Balna 's husband -RRB- said he would go out hunting , and away he went ; and they waited long for him , but he never came back.\n", "Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of him ; and they went away , but they also did not return.\n", "And the seven person_3sses grieved very much , for they feared that their kind husbands must have been killed.\n", "One day , not long after this had happened , as Balna was rocking her baby 's cradle , and whilst her sisters were working in the room below , there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress , who said that he was a Fakir , and came to beg.\n", "The servants said to him , `` You can not go into the palace -- the person_0 's sons have all gone away ; we think they must be dead , and their widows can not be interrupted by your begging\"\n", "But he said , `` I am a holy man , you must let me in\"\n", "Then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace , but they did not know that this was no Fakir , but a wicked person_2 named Punchkin.\n", "Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace , and saw many beautiful things there , till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singing beside her little boy 's cradle.\n", "The person_2 thought her more beautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen , insomuch that he asked her to go home with him and to marry him.\n", "But she said , `` My husband , I fear , is dead , but my little boy is still quite young ; I will stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man , and when he is grown up he shall go out into the world , and try and learn tidings of his father.\n", "Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him , or marry you\"\n", "At these words the person_2 was very angry , and turned her into a little black dog , and led her away ; saying , `` Since you will not come with me of your own free will , I will make you\"\n", "So the poor person_3ss was dragged away , without any power of effecting an escape , or of letting her sisters know what had become of her.\n", "As Punchkin passed through the palace gate the servants said to him , `` Where did you get that pretty little dog ?\"\n", "And he answered , `` One of the person_3sses gave it to me as a present\"\n", "At hearing which they let him go without further questioning.\n", "Soon after this , the six elder person_3sses heard the little baby , their nephew , begin to cry , and when they went upstairs they were much surprised to find him all alone , and Balna nowhere to be seen.\n", "Then they questioned the servants , and when they heard of the Fakir and the little black dog , they guessed what had happened , and sent in every direction seeking them , but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to be found.\n", "What could six poor women do ? They gave up all hopes of ever seeing their kind husbands , and their sister , and her husband , again , and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care of their little nephew.\n", "Thus time went on , till Balna 's son was fourteen years old.\n", "Then , one day , his aunts told him the history of the family ; and no sooner did he hear it , than he was seized with a great desire to go in search of his father and mother and uncles , and if he could find them alive to bring them home again.\n", "His aunts , on learning his determination , were much alarmed and tried to dissuade him , saying , `` We have lost our husbands , and our sister and her husband , and you are now our sole hope ; if you go away , what shall we do ?\"\n", "But he replied , `` I pray you not to be discouraged ; I will return soon , and if it is possible bring my father and mother and uncles with me\"\n", "So he set out on his travels ; but for some months he could learn nothing to help him in his search.\n", "At last , after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles , and become almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents , he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones , and rocks , and trees , and there he saw a large palace with a high tower ; hard by which was a Malee 's little house.\n", "As he was looking about , the Malee 's wife saw him , and ran out of the house and said , `` My dear boy , who are you that dare venture to this dangerous place ?\"\n", "He answered , `` I am a person_0 's son , and I come in search of my father , and my uncles , and my mother whom a wicked enchanter bewitched\"\n", "Then the Malee 's wife said , `` This country and this palace belong to a great enchanter ; he is all powerful , and if any one displeases him , he can turn them into stones and trees.\n", "All the rocks and trees you see here were living people once , and the person_2 turned them to what they now are.\n", "Some time ago a person_0 's son came here , and shortly afterwards came his six brothers , and they were all turned into stones and trees ; and these are not the only unfortunate ones , for up in that tower lives a beautiful person_3ss , whom the person_2 has kept prisoner there for twelve years , because she hates him and will not marry him\"\n", "Then the little person_3 thought , `` These must be my parents and my uncles.\n", "I have found what I seek at last\"\n", "So he told his story to the Malee 's wife , and begged her to help him to remain in that place awhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentioned ; and she promised to befriend him , and advised his disguising himself lest the person_2 should see him , and turn him likewise into stone.\n", "To this the person_3 agreed.\n", "So the Malee 's wife dressed him up in a saree , and pretended that he was her daughter.\n", "One day , not long after this , as the person_2 was walking in his garden he saw the little girl -LRB- as he thought -RRB- playing about , and asked her who she was.\n", "She told him she was the Malee 's daughter , and the person_2 said , `` You are a pretty little girl , and to-morrow you shall take a present of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in the tower\"\n", "The young person_3 was much delighted at hearing this , and went immediately to inform the Malee 's wife ; after consultation with whom he determined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguise , and trust to the chance of a favourable opportunity for establishing some communication with his mother , if it were indeed she.\n", "Now it happened that at Balna 's marriage her husband had given her a small gold ring on which her name was engraved , and she had put it on her little son 's finger when he was a baby , and afterwards when he was older his aunts had had it enlarged for him , so that he was still able to wear it.\n", "The Malee 's wife advised him to fasten the well-known treasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother , and trust to her recognizing it.\n", "This was not to be done without difficulty , as such a strict watch was kept over the poor person_3ss -LRB- for fear of her ever establishing communication with her friends -RRB- , that though the supposed Malee 's daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day , the person_2 or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time.\n", "At last one day , however , opportunity favored him , and when no one was looking , the boy tied the ring to a nosegay , and threw it at Balna 's feet.\n", "It fell with a clang on the floor , and Balna , looking to see what made the strange sound , found the little ring tied to the flowers.\n", "On recognizing it , she at once believed the story her son told her of his long search , and begged him to advise her as to what she had better do ; at the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his life by trying to rescue her.\n", "She told him that for twelve long years the person_2 had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marry him , and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release.\n", "Now Balna 's son was a bright , clever boy , so he said , `` Do not fear , dear mother ; the first thing to do is to discover how far the person_2 's power extends , in order that we may be able to liberate my father and uncles , whom he has imprisoned in the form of rocks and trees.\n", "You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years ; now rather speak kindly.\n", "Tell him you have given up all hopes of again seeing the husband you have so long mourned , and say you are willing to marry him.\n", "Then endeavor to find out what his power consists in , and whether he is immortal , or can be put to death\"\n", "Balna determined to take her son 's advice ; and the next day sent for Punchkin , and spoke to him as had been suggested.\n", "The person_2 , greatly delighted , begged her to allow the wedding to take place as soon as possible.\n", "But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a little more time , in which she might make his acquaintance , and that , after being enemies so long , their friendship could but strengthen by degrees.\n", "`` And do tell me ,\"\n", "she said , `` are you quite immortal ? Can death never touch you ? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering ?\"\n", "`` Why do you ask ?\"\n", "said he.\n", "`` Because ,\"\n", "she replied , `` if I am to be your wife , I would fain know all about you , in order , if any calamity threatens you , to overcome , or if possible to avert it\"\n", "`` It is true ,\"\n", "he added , `` that I am not as others.\n", "Far , far away , hundreds of thousands of miles from this , there lies a desolate country covered with thick jungle.\n", "In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm trees , and in the center of the circle stand six chattees full of water , piled one above another : below the sixth chattee is a small cage which contains a little green parrot ; on the life of the parrot depends my life ; and if the parrot is killed I must die.\n", "It is , however ,\"\n", "he added , `` impossible that the parrot should sustain any injury , both on account of the inaccessibility of the country , and because , by my appointment , many thousand genii surround the palm trees , and kill all who approach the place\"\n", "Balna told her son what Punchkin had said ; but at the same time implored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.\n", "The person_3 , however , replied , `` Mother , unless I can get hold of that parrot , you , and my father , and uncles , can not be liberated : be not afraid , I will shortly return.\n", "Do you , meantime , keep the person_2 in good humor -- still putting off your marriage with him on various pretexts ; and before he finds out the cause of delay , I will be here\"\n", "So saying , he went away.\n", "Many , many weary miles did he travel , till at last he came to a thick jungle ; and , being very tired , sat down under a tree and fell asleep.\n", "He was awakened by a soft rustling sound , and looking about him , saw a large serpent which was making its way to an eagle 's nest built in the tree under which he lay , and in the nest were two young eagles.\n", "The person_3 seeing the danger of the young birds , drew his sword , and killed the serpent ; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the air , and the two old eagles , who had been out hunting for food for their young ones , returned.\n", "They quickly saw the dead serpent and the young person_3 standing over it ; and the old mother eagle said to him , `` Dear boy , for many years all our young ones have been devoured by that cruel serpent ; you have now saved the lives of our children ; whenever you are in need , therefore , send to us and we will help you ; and as for these little eagles , take them , and let them be your servants\"\n", "At this the person_3 was very glad , and the two eaglets crossed their wings , on which he mounted ; and they carried him far , far away over the thick jungles , until he came to the place where grew the circle of palm trees , in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of water.\n", "It was the middle of the day , and the heat was very great.\n", "All round the trees were the genii fast asleep ; nevertheless , there were such countless thousands of them , that it would have been quite impossible for any one to walk through their ranks to the place ; down swooped the strong-winged eaglets -- down jumped the person_3 ; in an instant he had overthrown the six chattees full of water , and seized the little green parrot , which he rolled up in his cloak ; while , as he mounted again into the air , all the genii below awoke , and finding their treasure gone , set up a wild and melancholy howl.\n", "Away , away flew the little eagles , till they came to their home in the great tree ; then the person_3 said to the old eagles , `` Take back your little ones ; they have done me good service ; if ever again I stand in need of help , I will not fail to come to you\"\n", "He then continued his journey on foot till he arrived once more at the person_2 's palace , where he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrot.\n", "Punchkin saw him , and came to him quickly , and said , `` My boy , where did you get that parrot ? Give it to me , I pray you\"\n", "But the person_3 answered , `` Oh no , I can not give away my parrot , it is a great pet of mine ; I have had it many years\"\n", "Then the person_2 said , `` If it is an old favorite , I can understand your not caring to give it away ; but come what will you sell it for ?\"\n", "`` Sir ,\"\n", "replied the person_3 , `` I will not sell my parrot\"\n", "Then Punchkin got frightened , and said , `` Anything , anything ; name what price you will , and it shall be yours\"\n", "The person_3 answered , `` Let the seven person_0 's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly liberated\"\n", "`` It is done as you desire ,\"\n", "said the person_2 , `` only give me my parrot\"\n", "And with that , by a stroke of his wand , Balna 's husband and his brothers resumed their natural shapes.\n", "`` Now , give me my parrot ,\"\n", "repeated Punchkin.\n", "`` Not so fast , my master ,\"\n", "rejoined the person_3 ; `` I must first beg that you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned\"\n", "The person_2 immediately waved his wand again ; and , whilst he cried , in an imploring voice , `` Give me my parrot !\"\n", "the whole garden became suddenly alive : where rocks , and stones , and trees had been before , stood person_0s , and Punts , and Sirdars , and mighty men on prancing horses , and jewelled pages , and troops of armed attendants.\n", "`` Give me my parrot !\"\n", "cried Punchkin.\n", "Then the boy took hold of the parrot , and tore off one of its wings ; and as he did so the person_2 's right arm fell off.\n", "Punchkin then stretched out his left arm , crying , `` Give me my parrot !\"\n", "The person_3 pulled off the parrot 's second wing , and the person_2 's left arm tumbled off.\n", "`` Give me my parrot !\"\n", "cried he , and fell on his knees.\n", "The person_3 pulled off the parrot 's right leg , the person_2 's right leg fell off : the person_3 pulled off the parrot 's left leg , down fell the person_2 's left.\n", "Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head ; but still he rolled his eyes , and cried , `` Give me my parrot !\"\n", "`` Take your parrot , then ,\"\n", "cried the boy , and with that he wrung the bird 's neck , and threw it at the person_2 ; and , as he did so , Punchkin 's head twisted round , and , with a fearful groan , he died !

shalt go with us\"\n", "And she thought to herself , `` That she most certainly can not do\"\n", "When the step-mother had emptied the two dishes of lentils amongst the ashes , the maiden went through

all speed , and went to the festival.\n", "Her step-sisters and the step-mother however did not know her , and thought she must be a foreign princess , for she looked so beautiful in the golden dress.\n", "They never once thought of person_0 , and believed that she was sitting at home in the dirt , picking lentils out of the ashes.\n", "The prince went to meet her , took her by the hand and

evening , and then she wanted to go home.\n", "But the person_1 's son said , `` I will go with thee and bear thee company ,\"\n", "for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged.\n", "She escaped from him , however , and sprang into the pigeon-house.\n", "The person_1 's son waited until her father came , and then he told him that the stranger maiden had leapt into the pigeon-house.\n", "The old man thought , `` Can it be person_0 ?\"\n", "and they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew the pigeon-house to pieces , but no one was inside it.\n", "And when they got home person_0 lay in her dirty clothes among the ashes , and a dim little oil-lamp was burning on the mantle-piece , for person_0 had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house and had run to the little hazel-tree , and there she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave , and the bird had taken them away again , and then she had placed herself in the kitchen amongst the ashes in her gray gown.\n", "Next day when the festival began afresh , and her parents and the step-sisters had gone once more , person_0 went to the hazel-tree and said -- `` Shiver and quiver , my little tree , Silver and gold throw down over me\"\n", "Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the preceding day.\n", "And when person_0 appeared at the festival in this dress , every one was astonished at her beauty.\n", "The person_1 's son had waited until she came , and instantly took her by the hand and danced with no one but her.\n", "When others came and invited her , he said , `` She is my partner\"\n", "When evening came she wished to leave , and the person_1 's son followed her and wanted to see into which house she went.\n", "But she sprang away from him , and into the garden behind the house.\n", "Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pears.\n", "She clambered so nimbly between the branches like a squirrel that the person_1 's son did not know where she was gone.\n", "He waited until her father came , and said to him , `` The stranger-maiden has escaped from me , and I believe she has climbed up the pear-tree\"\n", "The father thought , `` Can it be person_0 ?\"\n", "and had an axe brought and cut the tree down , but no one was on it.\n", "And when they got into the kitchen , person_0 lay there amongst the ashes , as usual , for she had jumped down on the other side of the tree , had taken the beautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel-tree , and put on her gray gown.\n", "On the third day , when the parents and sisters had gone away , person_0 went once more to her mother 's grave and said to the little tree -- `` Shiver and quiver , my little tree , Silver and gold throw down over me\"\n", "And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had , and the slippers were golden.\n", "And when she went to the festival in the dress , no one knew how to speak for astonishment.\n", "The person_1 's son danced with her only , and if any one invited her to dance , he said , `` She is my partner\"\n", "When evening came , person_0 wished to leave , and the person_1 's son was anxious to go with her , but she escaped from him so quickly that he could not follow her.\n", "The person_1 's son had , however , used a strategem , and had caused the whole staircase to be smeared with pitch , and there , when she ran down , had the maiden 's left slipper remained sticking.\n", "The person_1 's son picked it up , and it was small and dainty , and all golden.\n", "Next morning , he went with it to the father , and said to him , `` No one shall be my wife but she whose foot this golden slipper fits\"\n", "Then were the two sisters glad , for they had pretty feet.\n", "The eldest went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on , and her mother stood by.\n", "But she could not get her big toe into it , and the shoe was too small for her.\n", "Then her mother gave her a knife and said , `` Cut the toe off ; when thou art Queen thou wilt have no more need to go on foot\"\n", "The maiden cut the toe off , forced the foot into the shoe , swallowed the pain , and went out to the person_1 's son.\n", "Then he took her on his his horse as his bride and rode away with her.\n", "They were , however , obliged to pass the grave , and there , on the hazel-tree , sat the two pigeons and cried , `` Turn and peep , turn and peep , There 's blood within the shoe , The shoe it is too small for her , The true bride waits for you\"\n", "Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was streaming from it.\n", "He turned his horse round and took the false bride home again , and said she was not the true one , and that the other sister was to put the shoe on.\n", "Then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe , but her heel was too large.\n", "So her mother gave her a knife and said , `` Cut a bit off thy heel ; when thou art Queen thou wilt have no more need to go on foot\"\n", "The maiden cut a bit off her heel , forced her foot into the shoe , swallowed the pain , and went out to the person_1 's son.\n", "He took her on his horse as his bride , and rode away with her , but when they passed by the hazel-tree , two little pigeons sat on it and cried , `` Turn and peep , turn and peep , There 's blood within the shoe The shoe it is too small for her , The true bride waits for you\"\n", "He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe , and how it had stained her white stocking.\n", "Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again.\n", "`` This also is not the right one ,\"\n", "said he , `` have you no other daughter ?\"\n", "`` No ,\"\n", "said the man , `` There is still a little stunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her , but she can not possibly be the bride\"\n", "The person_1 's son said he was to send her up to him ; but the mother answered , `` Oh , no , she is much too dirty , she can not show herself !\"\n", "He absolutely insisted on it , and person_0 had to be called.\n", "She first washed her hands and face clean , and then went and bowed down before the person_1 's son , who gave her the golden shoe.\n", "Then she seated herself on a stool , drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe , and put it into the slipper , which fitted like a glove.\n", "And when she rose up and the person_1 's son looked at her face he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him and cried , `` That is the true bride !\"\n", "The step-mother and the two sisters were terrified and became pale with rage ; he , however , took person_0 on his horse and rode away with her.\n", "As they passed by the hazel-tree , the two white doves cried -- `` Turn and peep , turn and peep , No blood is in the shoe , The shoe is not too small for her , The true bride rides with you ,\"\n", "and when they had cried that , the two came flying down and placed themselves on person_0 's shoulders , one on the right , the other on the left , and remained sitting there.\n", "When the wedding with the person_1 's son had to be celebrated , the two false sisters came and wanted to get into favor with person_0 and share her good fortune.\n", "When the betrothed couple went to church , the elder was at the right side and the younger at the left , and the pigeons pecked out one eye of each of them.\n", "Afterwards as they came

"They lived now for a while happy and contented with each other , and then it befell that the young Queen was attacked by a severe illness , and no physician could save her.\n", "And as she lay there dead , the young King remembered what he had been obliged to promise , and was horrified at having to lie down alive in the grave , but there was no escape.\n", "The King had placed sentries at all

before him , he saw a snake creep out of a corner of the vault and approach the dead body.\n", "And as he thought it came to gnaw at it , he drew his sword and said , `` As long as I live , thou shalt not touch her ,\"\n", "and hewed the snake in three pieces.\n", "After a time a second snake crept out of the hole , and when it saw the other lying dead and cut in pieces , it went back , but soon

"Immediately the severed parts joined themselves together , the snake moved , and became alive again , and both of them hastened away together.\n", "The leaves were left lying on the ground , and a desire came into the mind of the unhappy man who had been watching all this , to know if the wondrous power of the leaves which had brought the snake to life again , could not likewise be of service to a human being.\n", "So he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his dead wife , and the two others on her eyes.\n", "And hardly had he done this than the blood stirred in her veins , rose into her pale face , and colored it again.\n", "Then she drew breath , opened her eyes , and said , `` Ah , God , where am I ?\"\n", "`` Thou art with me , dear wife ,\"\n", "he answered , and told her how everything had happened , and how he had brought her back again to life.\n", "Then he gave her some wine and bread , and when she had regained her strength , he raised her up and

the great love and fidelity which he had shown her , and which had been the means of rescuing her from death , and conceived a wicked inclination for the skipper.\n", "And once when the young King lay there asleep , she called in the skipper and seized the sleeper by the head , and the skipper took him by the feet , and thus they threw him down into the sea.\n", "When the shameful deed was done , she said , `` Now let us return home , and say that he died on the way.\n", "I will extol and praise thee so to my father that he will marry me to thee , and make thee the heir to his crown\"\n", "But the faithful servant who had seen all that they did , unseen by them , unfastened a little boat from the ship , got into it , sailed after his master , and let the traitors go on their way.\n", "He fished up the dead body , and by the help of the three snake-leaves which he carried about with him , and laid on the eyes and mouth , he fortunately brought the young King back to life.\n", "They both rowed with all their strength day and night , and their little boat flew so swiftly that they reached the old King before the others did.\n", "He was astonished when he saw them come alone , and asked what had happened to them.\n", "When he learned the wickedness of his daughter he said , `` I can not believe that she has behaved so ill , but the truth will soon come to light ,\"\n", "and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep themselves hidden from every one.\n", "Soon afterwards the great ship came sailing in , and the godless woman appeared before her father with a troubled countenance.\n", "He said , `` Why dost thou come back alone ? Where is thy husband ?\"\n", "`` Ah , dear father ,\"\n", "she replied , `` I come home again in great grief ; during the voyage , my husband became suddenly ill and died , and if the good skipper had not given me his help , it would have gone ill with me.\n", "He was present at his death , and can tell you all\"\n", "The King said , `` I will make the dead alive again ,\"\n", "and opened the chamber , and bade the two come out.\n", "When the woman saw her husband , she was thunderstruck , and fell on her knees and begged for mercy.\n", "The King said , `` There is no mercy.\n", "He was ready to die with thee and restored thee to life again , but thou hast murdered him in his sleep , and shalt receive the reward that thou deservest\"\n", "Then she was placed with her accomplice in a ship which had been pierced with holes , and sent out to sea , where they soon sank amid the waves\"\n", "DIVERTING in extreme there is a play , Which oft resumes its fascinating sway ; Delights the sex , or ugly , fair , or sour ; By night or day : -- ` tis sweet at any hour.\n", "The frolick , ev ` ry where is known to fame ; Conjecture if you can , and tells its name.\n", "THIS play 's chief charm to husbands is unknown ; ` Tis with the lover it excels alone ; No lookers-on , as umpires , are required ; No quarrels rise , though each appears inspired ; All seem delighted with the pleasing game : -- Conjecture if you can , and tell its name.\n", "BE this as ` twill , and called whate'er it may ; No longer trifling with it I shall stay , But now disclose a method to transmit -LRB- As oft we find -RRB- to ninnies sense and wit.\n", "Till person_1 got instruction in this school , She was regarded as a silly fool , Her exercise appeared to spin and sew : -- Not hers indeed , the hands alone would go ; For sense or wit had in it no concern ; Whate'er the foolish girl had got to learn , No part therein could ever take the mind ; Her doll , for thought , was just as well designed.\n", "The mother would , a hundred times a day , Abuse the stupid maid , and to her say Go wretched lump and try some wit to gain.\n", "THE girl , quite overcome with shame and pain ; Her neighbors asked to point her out the spot , Where useful wit by purchase might be got.\n", "The simple question laughter raised around ; At length they told her , that it might be found With father Bonadventure , who 'd a stock , Which he at times disposed of to his flock.\n", "AWAY in haste she to the cloister went , To see the friar she was quite intent , Though trembling lest she might disturb his ease ; And one of his high character displease.\n", "The girl exclaimed , as on she moved , -- Will he Such presents willingly bestow on me , Whose age , as yet , has scarcely reached fifteen ?

but now I changed my mind , for the falling in of those pieces of meat put me in hopes of a way of saving my life.\n", "I began to gather together the largest diamonds that I could see , and put them into the leathern bag in which I used to carry my provisions.\n", "I afterwards took the largest piece of meat I could find , tied it close round me with the cloth of my turban , and then laid myself upon the ground , with my face downward , the bag of diamonds being tied fast to my girdle , so that it could not possibly drop off.\n", "I had scarcely laid me down before the eagles came.\n", "Each of them seized a piece of meat , and one of the strongest having taken me up , with a piece of meat on my back , carried me to his nest on the top of the mountain.\n", "The merchants fell straightway to shouting , to frighten the eagles ; and when they had obliged them to quit their prey , one of them came to the nest where I was.\n", "He was very much afraid when he saw me , but recovering himself , instead of inquiring how I came thither , he began to quarrel with me , and asked why I stole his goods.\n", "` You will treat me , ' replied I , ` with more civility when you know me better.\n", "Do not trouble yourself ; I have diamonds enough for you and myself too , more than all the other merchants together.\n", "If they have any , it is by chance ; but I chose myself in the bottom of the valley all those which you see in this bag ' ; and having spoken those words , I showed them to him.\n", "I had scarcely done speaking , when the other merchants came trooping about us , much astonished to see me ; but they were much more surprised when I told them my story.\n", "Yet they did not so much admire my stratagem to save myself as my courage to attempt it.\n", "They took me to the place where they were staying all together , and there having opened my bag , they were surprised at the largeness of my diamonds , and confessed that in all the courts where they had been they had never seen any that came near them.\n", "I prayed the merchant to whom the nest belonged -LRB- for every merchant had his own -RRB- , to take as many for his share as he pleased.\n", "He contented himself with one , and that too the least of them ; and when I pressed him to take more , without fear of doing me any injury , ` No , ' said he , ` I am very well satisfied with this , which is valuable enough to save me the trouble of making any more voyages to raise as great a fortune as I desire.\n", "' I spent the night with those merchants , to whom I told my story a second time , for the satisfaction of those who had not heard it.\n", "I could not moderate my joy when I found myself delivered from the danger I have mentioned.\n", "I thought I was in a dream , and could scarcely believe myself to be out of danger.\n", "The merchants had thrown their pieces of meat into the valley for several days , and each of them being satisfied with the diamonds that had fallen to his lot , we left the place next morning all together , and traveled near high mountains , where there were serpents of a prodigious length , which we had the good fortune to escape.\n", "We took ship at the nearest port and came to the Isle of Roha , where the trees grow that yield camphor.\n", "This tree is so large , and its branches so thick , that a hundred men may easily sit under its shade.\n", "The juice of which the camphor is made runs out from a hole bored in the upper part of the tree , is received in a vessel , where it grows thick , and becomes what we call camphor ;

this horn is solid , and cleft in the middle from one end to the other , and there are upon it white lines , representing the figure of a man.\n", "The rhinoceros fights with the elephant , runs his horn into him , and carries him off upon his head ; but the blood of the elephant running into his eyes and making him blind , he falls to the ground , and then , strange to relate , the roc comes and carries them both away in her claws to be food for her young ones.\n", "Here I exchanged some of my diamonds for good merchandise.\n", "From thence we went to other isles , and at last , having touched at several trading towns of the main land , we landed at Balsora , from whence I went to Bagdad.\n", "There I immediately gave great alms to the poor , and lived honourably upon the vast riches I had gained with so much fatigue\"\n", "My father left me the best inheritance ;

if you will get me an iron staff which is strong , and which I can not break against my knees , I will go out into the world\"\n", "The farmer was glad , put his two horses in his cart , and fetched from the smith a staff so large and thick , that the two horses could only just bring it away.\n", "The youth laid it across his knees , and snap ! he broke it in two in the middle like a bean-stalk , and threw it away.\n", "The father then harnessed four horses , and brought a bar which was so long and thick , that the four horses could only just drag it.\n", "The son snapped this also in twain against his knees , threw it away , and said , `` Father , this can be of no use to me , you must harness more horses , and bring a stronger staff\"\n", "So the father harnessed eight horses , and brought one which was so long and thick , that the eight horses could only just carry it.\n", "When the son took it in his hand , he broke off a bit from the top of it also , and said , `` Father , I see that you will not be able to procure me any such staff as I want , I will remain no longer with you\"\n", "So he went away , and gave out that he was a smith 's apprentice.\n", "He arrived at a village , wherein lived a smith who was a greedy fellow , who never did a kindness to any one , but wanted everything for himself.\n", "The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman.\n", "`` Yes ,\"\n", "said the smith , and looked at him , and thought , `` That is a strong fellow who will strike out well , and earn his bread\"\n", "So he asked , `` How much wages dost thou want ?\"\n", "`` I do n't want any at all ,\"\n", "he replied , `` only every fortnight , when the other journeymen are paid , I will give thee two blows , and thou must bear them\"\n", "The miser was heartily satisfied , and thought he would thus save much money.\n", "Next morning , the strange journeyman was to begin to work , but when the master brought the glowing bar , and the youth struck his first blow , the iron flew asunder , and the anvil sank so deep into the earth , that there was no bringing it out again.\n", "Then the miser grew angry , and said , `` Oh , but I ca n't make any use of you , you strike far too powerfully ; what will you have for the one blow ?\"\n", "Then said he , `` I will only give you quite a small blow , that 's all\"\n", "And he raised his foot , and gave him such a kick that he flew away over four loads of hay.\n", "Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in the smithy for himself , took it as a stick in his hand and went onwards.\n", "When he had walked for some time , he came to a small farm , and asked the bailiff if he did not require a head-servant.\n", "`` Yes ,\"\n", "said the bailiff , `` I can make use of one ; you look a strong fellow who can do something , how much a year do you want as wages ?\"\n", "He again replied that he wanted no wages at all , but that every year he would give him three blows , which he must bear.\n", "Then the bailiff was satisfied , for he , too , was a covetous fellow.\n", "Next morning all the servants were to go into the wood , and the others were already up , but the head-servant was still in bed.\n", "Then one of them called to him , `` Get up , it is time ; we are going into the wood , and thou must go with us\"\n", "`` Ah ,\"\n", "said he quite roughly and surlily , `` you may just go , then ; I shall be back again before any of you\"\n", "Then the others went to the bailiff , and told him that the head-man was still lying in bed , and would not go into the wood with them.\n", "The bailiff said they were to awaken him again , and tell him to harness the horses.\n", "The head-man , however , said as before , `` Just go there , I shall be back again before any of you\"\n", "And then he stayed in bed two hours longer.\n", "At length he arose from the feathers , but first he got himself two bushels of peas from the loft , made himself some broth with them , ate it at his leisure , and when that was done , went and harnessed the horses , and drove into the wood.\n", "Not far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass , so he first drove the horses on , and then stopped them , and went behind the cart , took trees and brushwood , and made a great barricade , so that no horse could get through.\n", "When he was entering the wood , the others were just driving out of it with their loaded carts to go home ; then said he to them , `` Drive on , I will still get home before you do\"\n", "He did not drive far into the wood , but at once tore two of the very largest trees of all out of the earth , threw them on his cart , and turned round.\n", "When he came to the barricade , the others were still standing there , not able to get through.\n", "`` Do n't you see ,\"\n", "said he , `` that if you had stayed with me , you would have got home just as quickly , and would have had another hour 's sleep ?\"\n", "He now wanted to drive on , but his horses could not work their way through , so he unharnessed them , laid them on the top of the cart , took the shafts in his own hands , and pulled it all through , and he did this just as easily as if it had been laden with feathers.\n", "When he was over , he said to the others , `` There , you see , I have got over quicker than you ,\"\n", "and drove on , and the others had to stay where they were.\n", "In the yard , however , he took a tree in his hand , showed it to the bailiff , and said , `` Is n't that a fine bundle of wood ?\"\n", "Then said the bailiff to his wife , `` The servant is a good one , if he does sleep long , he is still home before the others\"\n", "So he served the bailiff for a year , and when that was over , and the other servants were getting their wages , he said it was time for him to take his too.\n", "The bailiff , however , was afraid of the blows which he was to receive , and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having them ; for rather than that , he himself would be head-servant , and the youth should be bailiff.\n", "`` No ,\"\n", "said he , `` I will not be a bailiff , I am head-servant , and will remain so , but I will administer that which we agreed on\"\n", "The bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he demanded , but it was of no use , the head-servant said no to everything.\n", "Then the bailiff did not know what to do , and begged for a fortnight 's delay , for he wanted to find some way of escape.\n", "The head-servant consented to this delay.\n", "The bailiff summoned all his clerks together , and they were to think the matter over , and give him advice.\n", "The clerks pondered for a long time , but at last they said that no one was sure of his life with the head-servant , for he could kill a man as easily as a midge , and that the bailiff ought to make him get into the well and clean it , and when he was down below , they would roll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there , and throw it on his head ; and then he would never return to daylight.\n", "The advice pleased the bailiff , and the head-servant was quite willing to go down the well.\n", "When he was standing down below at the bottom , they rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken his skull , but he cried , `` Chase away those hens from the well , they are scratching in the sand up there , and throwing the grains into my eyes , so that I ca n't see\"\n", "So the bailiff cried , `` Sh-sh ,\"\n", "and pretended to frighten the hens away.\n", "When the head-servant had finished his work , he climbed up and said , `` Just look what a beautiful neck-tie I have on ,\"\n", "and behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing round his neck.\n", "The head-servant now wanted to take his reward , but the bailiff again begged for a fortnight 's delay.\n", "The clerks met together and advised him to send the head-servant to the haunted mill to grind corn by night , for from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive.\n", "The proposal pleased the bailiff , he called the head-servant that very evening , and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill , and grind it that night , for it was wanted.\n", "So the head-servant went to the loft , and put two bushels in his right pocket , and two in his left , and took four in a wallet , half on his back , and half on his breast , and thus laden went to the haunted mill.\n", "The miller told him that he could grind there very well by day , but not by night , for the mill was haunted , and that up to the present time whosoever had gone into it at night had been found in the morning lying dead inside.\n", "He said , `` I will manage it , just you go away to bed\"\n", "Then he went into the mill , and poured out the corn.\n", "About eleven o'clock he went into the miller 's room , and sat down on the bench.\n", "When he had sat there a while , a door suddenly opened , and a large table came in , and on the table , wine and roasted meats placed themselves , and much good food besides , but everything came of itself , for no one was there to carry it.\n", "After this the chairs pushed themselves up , but no people came , until all at once he beheld fingers , which handled knives and forks , and laid food on the plates , but with this exception he saw nothing.\n", "As he was hungry , and saw the food , he , too , place himself at the table , ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it.\n", "When he had had enough , and the others also had quite emptied their dishes , he distinctly heard all the candles being suddenly snuffed out , and as it was now pitch dark , he felt something like a box on the ear.\n", "Then he said , `` If anything of that kind comes again , I shall strike out in return\"\n", "And when he had received a second box on the ear , he , too struck out.\n", "And so it continued the whole night.\n", "He took nothing without returning it , but repaid everything with interest , and did not lay about him in vain.\n", "At daybreak , however , everything ceased.\n", "When the miller had got up , he wanted to look after him , and wondered if he were still alive.\n", "Then the youth said , `` I have eaten my fill , have received some boxes on the ears , but I have given some in return\"\n", "The miller rejoiced , and said that the mill was now released from the spell , and wanted to give him much money as a reward.\n", "But he said , `` Money , I will not have , I have enough of it\"\n", "So he took his meal on his back , went home , and told the bailiff that he had done what he had been told to do , and would now have the reward agreed on.\n", "When the bailiff heard that , he was seriously alarmed and quite beside himself ; he walked backwards and forwards in the room , and drops of perspiration ran down from his forehead.\n", "Then he opened the window to get some fresh air , but before he was aware , the head-servant had given him such a kick that he flew through the window out into the air , and so far away that no one ever saw him again.\n", "Then said the head-servant to the bailiff 's wife , `` If he does not come back , you must take the other blow\"\n", "She cried , `` No , no I can not bear it ,\"\n", "and opened the other window , because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead.\n", "Then he gave her such a kick that she , too , flew out , and as she was lighter she went much higher than her husband.\n", "Her husband cried , `` Do come to me ,\"\n", "but she replied , `` Come thou to me , I can not come to thee\"\n", "And they hovered about there in the air , and could not get to each other , and whether they are still hovering about , or not , I do not know , but the young giant took up his iron bar , and went on his way\"\n", "person_0 had served his master for seven years , so he said to him , `` Master , my time is up ;

, `` What is my dear brother saying ?\"\n", "`` Ah ,\"\n", "said the old woman , `` he says that you ought to take off your golden hood and give it to your sister\"\n", "So she took off the hood and

swimming up the gutter to the kitchen , and said to the kitchen-boy , `` Boy , light a fire , that I may warm my feathers\"\n", "The kitchen-boy did it , and lighted a fire on the hearth.\n", "Then came the duck and sat down by it , and shook herself and smoothed her feathers to rights with her bill.\n", "While she was thus sitting and enjoying herself , she asked , `` What is my brother Reginer

`` She is loved by the person_0 and happy\"\n", "`` May God have mercy on him ,\"\n", "said the duck , and swam forth by the sink.\n", "The next night she came again and put the same questions , and the third night also.\n", "Then the kitchen-boy could bear it no longer , and went to the person_0 and discovered all to him.\n", "The person_0 , however , wanted to see it for himself , and next evening went thither , and when the duck thrust her head in through the sink , he took his sword and cut through her neck , and suddenly she changed into a most beautiful maiden , exactly like the picture , which her brother had made of her.\n", "The person_0 was full of joy , and as she stood there quite wet , he caused splendid apparel to be brought and had her clothed in it.\n", "Then she told how she had been betrayed by cunning and falsehood , and at last thrown down into the water , and her first request was that her brother should be brought forth from the pit of snakes , and when the person_0 had fulfilled this request , he went into the chamber where the old witch was , and asked , What does she deserve who does this and that ? and related what had happened.\n", "Then was she so blinded that she was aware of nothing and said , `` She deserves to be stripped naked , and put into a barrel with nails , and that a horse should be harnessed to the barrel , and the horse sent all over the world\"\n", "All of which was done to her , and to her black daughter.\n", "But the person_0 married the white and beautiful bride , and rewarded her faithful brother , and made him a rich and distinguished man\"\n", "There was once a poor man who had four sons , and when they were grown up , he said to them , `` My dear children , you must now go out into the world , for I have nothing to give you , so set out , and go to some distance and learn a trade , and see how you can make your way\"\n", "So the four brothers took their sticks , bade their father farewell , and went through the town-gate together.\n", "When they had traveled about for some time , they came to a cross-way which branched off in four different directions.\n", "Then said the eldest , `` Here we must separate , but on this day four years , we will meet each other again at this spot , and in the meantime we will seek our fortunes\"\n", "Then each of them went his way , and the eldest met a man who asked him where he was going , and what he was intending to do ? `` I want to learn a trade ,\"\n", "he replied.\n", "Then the other said , `` Come with me , and be a thief\"\n", "`` No ,\"\n", "he answered , `` that is no longer regarded as a reputable trade , and the end of it is that one has to swing on the gallows\"\n", "`` Oh ,\"\n", "said the man , `` you need not be afraid of the gallows ; I will only teach you to get such things as no other man could ever lay hold of , and no one will ever detect you\"\n", "So he allowed himself to be talked into it , and while with the man became an accomplished thief , and so dexterous that nothing was safe from him , if he once desired to have it.\n", "The second brother met a man who put the same question to him what he wanted to learn in the world.\n", "`` I do n't know yet ,\"\n", "he replied.\n", "`` Then come with me , and be an astronomer ; there is nothing better than that , for nothing is hid from you\"\n", "He liked the idea , and became such a skillful astronomer that when he had learned everything , and was about to travel onwards , his master gave him a telescope and said to him , `` With that you canst thou see whatsoever takes place either on earth or in heaven , and nothing can remain concealed from thee\"\n", "A huntsman took the third brother into training , and gave him such excellent instruction in everything which related to huntsmanship , that he became an experienced hunter.\n", "When he went away , his master gave him a gun and said , `` It will never fail you ; whatsoever you aim at , you are certain to hit\"\n", "The youngest brother also met a man who spoke to him , and inquired what his intentions were.\n", "`` Would you not like to be a tailor ?\"\n", "said he.\n", "`` Not that I know of ,\"\n", "said the youth ; `` sitting doubled up from morning till night , driving the needle and the goose backwards and forwards , is not to my taste\"\n", "`` Oh , but you are speaking in ignorance ,\"\n", "answered the man ; `` with me you would learn a very different kind of tailoring , which is respectable and proper , and for the most part very honorable\"\n", "So he let himself be persuaded , and went with the man , and learned his art from the very beginning.\n", "When they parted , the man gave the youth a needle , and said , `` With this you can sew together whatever is given you , whether it is as soft as an egg or as hard as steel ; and it will all become one piece of stuff , so that no seam will be visible\"\n", "When the appointed four years were over , the four brothers arrived at the same time at the cross-roads , embraced and kissed each other , and returned home to their father.\n", "`` So now ,\"\n", "said he , quite delighted , `` the wind has blown you back again to me\"\n", "They told him of all that had happened to them , and that each had learned his own trade.\n", "Now they were sitting just in front of the house under a large tree , and the father said , `` I will put you all to the test , and see what you can do\"\n", "Then he looked up and said to his second son , `` Between two branches up at the top of this tree , there is a chaffinch 's nest , tell me how many eggs there are in it ?\"\n", "The astronomer took his glass , looked up , and said , `` There are five\"\n", "Then the father said to the eldest , `` Fetch the eggs down without disturbing the bird which is sitting hatching them\"\n", "The skillful thief climbed up , and took the five eggs from beneath the bird , which never observed what he was doing , and remained quietly sitting where she was , and brought them down to his father.\n", "The father took them , and put one of them on each corner of the table , and the fifth in the middle , and said to the huntsman , `` With one shot thou shalt shoot me the five eggs in two , through the middle\"\n", "The huntsman aimed , and shot the eggs , all five as the father had desired , and that at one shot.\n", "He certainly must have had some of the powder for shooting round corners.\n", "`` Now it 's your turn ,\"\n", "said the father to the fourth son ; `` you shall sew the eggs together again , and the

for he was sure that the king would now receive them.\n", "The night before they left the viziers and others , whom the king intended to have executed as soon as his visitors had left , came and besought the vizier 's son to plead for them , and promised that they each would give him a daughter in marriage.\n", "He agreed to do so , and succeeded in obtaining their pardon.\n", "Then the prince , with his beautiful bride person_0 , and the vizier 's son , attended by a troop of soldiers , and a large number of camels and horses bearing very much treasure , left for their own land.\n", "In the midst of the way they passed the tower of the robbers , and with the help of the soldiers they razed it to the ground , slew all its inmates , and seized the treasure which they had been amassing there for several years.\n", "At length they reached their own country , and when the king saw his son 's beautiful wife and his magnificent retinue he was at once reconciled , and ordered him to enter the city and take up his abode there.\n", "Henceforth all was sunshine on the path of the prince.\n", "He became a great favorite , and in due time succeeded to the throne , and ruled the country for many , many years in peace and happiness\"\n", "The region round the little town of person_2 is very bleak and bare.\n", "The town certainly lies by the sea shore , which is always beautiful , but just there it might be more beautiful than it is : all around are flat fields , and it is a long way to the forest.\n", "But when one is very much at home in a place , one always finds something beautiful , and something that one longs for in the most charming spot in the world that is strange to us.\n", "We confess that , by the utmost boundary of the little town , where some humble gardens skirt the streamlet that falls into the sea , it must be very pretty in summer ; and this was the opinion of the two children from neighbouring houses , who were playing there , and forcing their way through the gooseberry bushes , to get to one another.\n", "In one of the gardens stood an elder tree , and in the other an old willow , and under the latter the children were especially very fond of playing ; they were allowed to play there , though , indeed , the tree stood close beside the stream , and they might easily have fallen into the water.\n", "But the eye of God watches over the little ones ; if it did not , they would be badly off.\n", "And , moreover , they were very careful with respect to the water ; in fact , the boy was so much afraid of it , that they could not lure him into the sea in summer , when the other children were splashing about in the waves.\n", "Accordingly , he was famously jeered and mocked at , and had to bear the jeering and mockery as best he could.\n", "But once person_1 , the neighbour 's little girl , dreamed she was sailing in a boat , and person_0 waded out to join her till the water rose , first to his neck , and afterwards closed over his head , so that he disappeared altogether.\n", "From the time when little person_0 heard of this dream , he would no longer bear the teasing of the other boys.\n", "He might go into the water now , he said , for person_1 had dreamed it.\n", "He certainly never carried the idea into practice , but the dream was his great guide for all that.\n", "Their parents , who were poor people , often took tea together , and person_0 and person_1 played in the gardens and on the high-road , where a row of willows had been planted beside the skirting ditch ; these trees , with their polled tops , certainly did not look beautiful , but they were not put there for ornament , but for use.\n", "The old willow tree in the garden was much handsomer , and therefore the children were fond of sitting under it.\n", "In the town itself there was a great market-place , and at the time of the fair this place was covered with whole streets of tents and booths , containing silk ribbons , boots , and everything that a person could wish for.\n", "There was great crowding , and generally the weather was rainy ; but it did not destroy the fragrance of the honey-cakes and the gingerbread , of which there was a booth quite full ; and the best of it was , that the man who kept this booth came every year to lodge during the fair-time in the dwelling of little person_0 's father.\n", "Consequently there came a present of a bit of gingerbread every now and then , and of course person_1 received her share of the gift.\n", "But , perhaps the most charming thing of all was that the gingerbread dealer knew all sorts of tales , and could even relate histories about his own gingerbread cakes ; and one evening , in particular , he told a story about them which made such a deep impression on the children that they never forgot it ; and for that reason it is perhaps advisable that we should hear it too , more especially as the story is not long.\n", "`` On the shop-board ,\"\n", "he said , `` lay two gingerbread cakes , one in the shape of a man with a hat , the other of a maiden without a bonnet ; both their faces were on the side that was uppermost , for they were to be looked at on that side , and not on the other ; and , indeed , most people have a favourable side from which they should be viewed.\n", "On the left side the man wore a bitter almond -- that was his heart ; but the maiden , on the other hand , was honey-cake all over.\n", "They were placed as samples on the shop-board , and remaining there a long time , at last they fell in love with one another , but neither told the other , as they should have done if they had expected anything to come of it\"\n", "` He is a man , and therefore he must speak first , ' she thought ; but she felt quite contented , for she knew her love was returned.\n", "`` His thoughts were far more extravagant , as is always the case with a man.\n", "He dreamed that he was a real street boy , that he had four pennies of his own , and that he purchased the maiden , and ate her up.\n", "So they lay on the shop-board for weeks and weeks , and grew dry and hard , but the thoughts of the maiden became ever more gentle and maidenly\"\n", "` It is enough for me that I have lived on the same table with him , ' she said , and crack ! she broke in two\"\n", "` If she had only known of my love , she would have kept together a little longer , ' he thought.\n", "`` And that is the story , and here they are , both of them ,\"\n", "said the baker in conclusion.\n", "`` They are remarkable for their curious history , and for their silent love , which never came to anything.\n", "And there they are for you !\"\n", "and , so saying , he gave person_1 the man who was yet entire , and person_0 got the broken maiden ; but the children had been so much impressed by the story that they could not summon courage to eat the lovers up.\n", "On the following day they went out with them to the churchyard , and sat down by the church wall , which is covered , winter and summer , with the most luxuriant ivy as with a rich carpet.\n", "Here they stood the two cake figures up in the sunshine among the green leaves , and told the story to a group of other children ; they told them of the silent love which led to nothing.\n", "It was called _ love _ because the story was so lovely , on that they all agreed.\n", "But when they turned to look again at the gingerbread pair , a big boy , out of mischief , had eaten up the broken maiden.\n", "The children cried about this , and afterwards -- probably that the poor lover might not be left in the world lonely and desolate -- they ate him up too ; but they never forgot the story.\n", "The children were always together by the elder tree and under the willow , and the little girl sang the most beautiful songs with a voice that was clear as a bell.\n", "person_0 , on the other hand , had not a note of music in him , but he knew the words of the songs , and that , at least , was something.\n", "The people of person_2 , even to the rich wife of the fancy-shop keeper , stood still and listened when person_1 sang.\n", "`` She has a very sweet voice , that little girl ,\"\n", "they said.\n", "Those were glorious days , but they could not last for ever.\n", "The neighbors were neighbors no longer.\n", "The little maiden 's mother was dead , and the father intended to marry again , in the capital , where he had been promised a living as a messenger , which was to be a very lucrative office.\n", "And the neighbors separated regretfully , the children weeping heartily , but the parents promised that they should at least write to one another once a year.\n", "And person_0 was bound apprentice to a shoemaker , for the big boy could not be allowed to run wild any longer ; and moreover he was confirmed.\n", "Ah , how gladly on that day of celebration would he have been in Copenhagen with little person_1 ! but he remained in person_2 , and had never yet been to Copenhagen , though the little town is only five Danish miles distant from the capital ; but far across the bay , when the sky was clear , person_0 had seen the towers in the distance , and on the day of his confirmation he could distinctly see the golden cross on the principal church glittering in the sun.\n", "Ah , how often his thoughts were with person_1 ! Did she think of him ? Yes.\n", "Towards Christmas there came a letter from her father to the parents of person_0 , to say that they were getting on very well in Copenhagen , and especially might person_1 look forward to a brilliant future on the strength of her fine voice.\n", "She had been engaged in the theater in which people sing , and was already earning some money , out of which she sent her dear neighbors of person_2 a dollar for the merry Christmas Eve.\n", "They were to drink her health , she had herself added in a postscript , and in the same postscript there stood further , `` A kind greeting to person_0\"\n", "The whole family wept : and yet all this was very pleasant ; those were joyful tears that they shed.\n", "person_0 's thoughts had been occupied every day with person_1 ; and now he knew that she also thought of him : and the nearer the time came when his apprenticeship would be over , the more clearly did it appear to him that he was very fond of person_1 , and that she must be his wife ; and when he thought of this , a smile came upon his lips , and he drew the thread twice as fast as before , and pressed his foot hard against the knee-strap.\n", "He ran the awl far into his finger , but he did not care for that.\n", "He determined not to play the dumb lover , as the two gingerbread cakes had done : the story should teach him a lesson.\n", "And now he was a journeyman , and his knapsack was packed ready for his journey : at length , for the first time in his life , he was to go to Copenhagen , where a master was already waiting for him.\n", "How glad person_1 would be ! She was now seventeen years old , and he nineteen.\n", "Already in person_2 he had wanted to buy a gold ring for her ; but he recollected that such things were to be had far better in Copenhagen.\n", "And now he took leave of his parents , and on a rainy day , late in the autumn , went forth on foot out of the town of his birth.\n", "The leaves were falling down from the trees , and he arrived at his new master 's in the metropolis wet to the skin.\n", "Next Sunday he was to pay a visit to person_1 's father.\n", "The new journeyman 's clothes were brought forth , and the new hat from person_2 was put on , which became person_0 very well , for till this time he had only worn a cap.\n", "And he found the house he sought , and mounted flight after flight of stairs until he became almost giddy.\n", "It was terrible to him to see how people lived piled up one over the other in the dreadful city.\n", "Everything in the room had a prosperous look , and person_1 's father received him very kindly.\n", "To the new wife he was a stranger , but she shook hands with him , and gave him some coffee.\n", "`` person_1 will be glad to see you ,\"\n", "said the father : `` you have grown quite a nice young man.\n", "You shall see her presently.\n", "She is a girl who rejoices my heart , and , please God , she will rejoice it yet more.\n", "She has her own room now , and pays us rent for it\"\n", "And the father knocked quite politely at the door , as if he were a visitor , and then they went in.\n", "But how pretty everything was in that room ! such an apartment was certainly not to be found in all person_2 : the queen herself could not be more charmingly lodged.\n", "There were carpets , there were window curtains quite down to the floor , and around were flowers and pictures , and a mirror into which there was almost danger that a visitor might step , for it was as large as a door ; and there was even a velvet chair.\n", "person_0 saw all this at a glance : and yet he saw nothing but person_1.\n", "She was a grown maiden , quite different from what person_0 had fancied her , and much more beautiful.\n", "In all person_2 there was not a girl like her.\n", "How graceful she was , and with what an odd unfamiliar glance she looked at person_0 ! But that was only for a moment , and then she rushed towards him as if she would have kissed him.\n", "She did not really do so , but she came very near it.\n", "Yes , she was certainly rejoiced at the arrival of the friend of her youth ! The tears were actually in her eyes ; and she had much to say , and many questions to put concerning all , from person_0 's parents down to the elder tree and the willow , which she called Elder-mother and Willow-father , as if they had been human beings ; and indeed they might pass as such , just as well as the gingerbread cakes ; and of these she spoke too , and of their silent love , and how they had lain upon the shop-board and split in two -- and then she laughed very heartily ; but the blood mounted into person_0 's cheeks , and his heart beat thick and fast.\n", "No , she had not grown proud at all.\n", "And it was through her -- he noticed it well -- that her parents invited him to stay the whole evening with them ; and she poured out the tea and gave him a cup with her own hands ; and afterwards she took a book and read aloud to them , and it seemed to person_0 that what she read was all about himself and his love , for it matched so well with his thoughts ; and then she sang a simple song , but through her singing it became like a history , and seemed to be the outpouring of her very heart.\n", "Yes , certainly she was fond of person_0.\n", "The tears coursed down his cheeks -- he could not restrain them , nor could he speak a single word : he seemed to himself as if he were struck dumb ; and yet she pressed his hand , and said , `` You have a good heart , person_0 -- remain always as you are now\"\n", "That was an evening of matchless delight to person_0 ; to sleep after it was impossible , and accordingly person_0 did not sleep.\n", "At parting , person_1 's father had said , `` Now , you wo n't forget us altogether ! Do n't let the whole winter go by without once coming to see us again ;\"\n", "and therefore he could very well go again the next Sunday , and resolved to do so.\n", "But every evening when working hours were over -- and they worked by candlelight there -- person_0 went out through the town : he went into the street in which person_1 lived , and looked up at her window ; it was almost always lit up , and one evening he could see the shadow of her face quite plainly on the curtain -- and that was a grand evening for him.\n", "His master 's wife did not like his gallivanting abroad every evening , as she expressed it ; and she shook her head ; but the master only smiled.\n", "`` He is only a young fellow ,\"\n", "he said.\n", "But person_0 thought to himself : `` On Sunday I shall see her , and I shall tell her how completely she reigns in my heart and soul , and that she must be my little wife.\n", "I know I am only a poor journeyman shoemaker , but I shall work and strive -- yes , I shall tell her so.\n", "Nothing comes of silent love : I have learned that from the cakes\"\n", "And Sunday came round , and person_0 sallied forth ; but , unluckily , they were all invited out for that evening , and were obliged to tell him so.\n", "person_1 pressed his hand and said , `` Have you ever been to the theater ? You must go once.\n", "I shall sing on Wednesday , and if you have time on that evening , I will send you a ticket ; my father knows where your master lives\"\n", "How kind that was of her ! And on Wednesday at noon he received a sealed paper , with no words written in it ; but the ticket was there , and in the evening person_0 went to the theater for the first time in his life.\n", "And what did he see ? He saw person_1 , and how charming and how beautiful she looked ! She was certainly married to a stranger , but that was all in the play -- something that was only make-believe , as person_0 knew very well.\n", "If it had been real , he thought , she would never have had the heart to send him a ticket that he might go and see it.\n", "And all the people shouted and applauded , and person_0 cried out `` hurrah !\"\n", "Even the king smiled at person_1 , and seemed to delight in her.\n", "Ah , how small person_0 felt ! but then he loved her so dearly , and thought that she loved him too ; but it was for the man to speak the first word , as the gingerbread maiden in the child 's story had taught him : and there was a great deal for him in that story.\n", "So soon as Sunday came , he went again.\n", "He felt as if he were going into a church.\n", "person_1 was alone , and received him -- it could not have happened more fortunately.\n", "`` It is well that you are come ,\"\n", "she said.\n", "`` I had an idea of sending my father to you , only I felt a presentiment that you would be here this evening ; for I must tell you that I start for France on Friday : I must go there , if I am to become efficient\"\n", "It seemed to person_0 as if the whole room were whirling round and round with him.\n", "He felt as if his heart would presently burst : no tear rose to his eyes , but still it was easy to see how sorrowful he was.\n", "`` You honest , faithful soul !\"\n", "she exclaimed ; and these words of hers loosened person_0 's tongue.\n", "He told her how constantly he loved her , and that she must become his wife ; and as he said this , he saw person_1 change color and turn pale.\n", "She let his hand fall , and answered , seriously and mournfully , `` person_0 , do not make yourself and me unhappy.\n", "I shall always be a good sister to you , one in whom you may trust , but I shall never be anything more\"\n", "And she drew her white hand over his hot forehead.\n", "`` Heaven gives us strength for much ,\"\n", "she said , `` if we only endeavor to do our best\"\n", "At that moment the stepmother came into the room ; and person_1 said quickly , `` person_0 is quite inconsolable because I am going away.\n", "Come , be a man ,\"\n", "she continued , and laid her hand upon his shoulder ; and it seemed as if they had been talking of the journey , and nothing else.\n", "`` You are a child ,\"\n", "she added ; `` but now you must be good and reasonable , as you used to be under the willow tree , when we were both children\"\n", "But person_0 felt as if the whole world had slid out of its course , and his thoughts were like a loose thread fluttering to and fro in the wind.\n", "He stayed , though he could not remember if she had asked him to stay ; and she was kind and good , and poured out his tea for him , and sang to him.\n", "It had not the old tone , and yet it was wonderfully beautiful , and made his heart feel ready to burst.\n", "And then they parted.\n", "person_0 did not offer her his hand , but she seized it , and said , `` Surely you will shake hands with your sister at parting , old playfellow !\"\n", "And she smiled through the tears that were rolling over her cheeks , and she repeated the word `` brother\"\n", "-- and certainly there was good consolation in that -- and thus they parted.\n", "She sailed to France , and person_0 wandered about the muddy streets of Copenhagen.\n", "The other journeymen in the workshop asked him why he went about so gloomily , and told him he should go and amuse himself with them , for he was a young fellow.\n", "And they went with him to the dancing-rooms.\n", "He saw many handsome girls there , but certainly not one like person_1 ; and here , where he thought to forget her , she stood more vividly than ever before the eyes of his soul.\n", "`` Heaven gives us strength for a great deal , if we only try to do our best ,\"\n", "she had said ; and holy thoughts came into his mind , and he folded his hands.\n", "The violins played , and the girls danced round in a circle ; and he was quite startled , for it seemed to him as if he were in a place to which he ought not to have brought person_1 -- for she was there with him , in his heart ; and accordingly he went out.\n", "He ran through the streets , and passed by the house where she had dwelt : it was dark there , dark everywhere , and empty , and lonely.\n", "The world went on its course , but person_0 pursued his lonely way , unheedingly.\n", "The winter came , and the streams were frozen.\n", "Everything seemed to be preparing for a burial.\n", "But when spring returned , and the first steamer was to start , a longing seized him to go away , far , far into the world , but not to France.\n", "So he packed his knapsack , and wandered far into the German land , from city to city , without rest or peace ; and it was not till he came to the glorious old city of Nuremberg that he could master his restless spirit ; and in Nuremberg , therefore , he decided to remain.\n", "Nuremberg is a wonderful old city , and looks as if it were cut out of an old picture-book.\n", "The streets seem to stretch themselves along just as they please.\n", "The houses do not like standing in regular ranks.\n", "Gables with little towers , arabesques , and pillars , start out over the pathway , and from the strange peaked roofs water-spouts , formed like dragons or great slim dogs , extend far over the street.\n", "Here in the market-place stood person_0 , with his knapsack on his back.\n", "He stood by one of the old fountains that are adorned with splendid bronze figures , scriptural and historical , rising up between the gushing jets of water.\n", "A pretty servant-maid was just filling her pails , and she gave person_0 a refreshing draught ; and as her hand was full of roses , she gave him one of the flowers , and he accepted it as a good omen.\n", "From the neighbouring church the strains of the organ were sounding : they seemed to him as familiar as the tones of the organ at home at person_2 ; and he went into the great cathedral.\n", "The sunlight streamed in through the stained glass windows , between the two lofty slender pillars.\n", "His spirit became prayerful , and peace returned to his soul.\n", "And he sought and found a good master in Nuremberg , with whom he stayed , and in whose house he learned the German language.\n", "The old moat round the town has been converted into a number of little kitchen gardens ; but the high walls are standing yet , with their heavy towers.\n", "The ropemaker twists his ropes on a gallery or walk built of wood , inside the town wall , where elder bushes grow out of the clefts and cracks , spreading their green twigs over the little low houses that stand below ; and in one of these dwelt the master with whom person_0 worked ; and over the little garret window at which person_0 sat the elder waved its branches.\n", "Here he lived through a summer and a winter ; but when the spring came again he could bear it no longer.\n", "The elder was in blossom , and its fragrance reminded him so of home , that he fancied himself back in the garden at person_2 ; and therefore person_0 went away from his master , and dwelt with another , farther in the town , over whose house no elder bush grew.\n", "His workshop was quite close to one of the old stone bridges , by a low water-mill , that rushed and foamed always.\n", "Without , rolled the roaring stream , hemmed in by houses , whose old decayed gables looked ready to topple down into the water.\n", "No elder grew here -- there was not even a flower-pot with its little green plant ; but just opposite the workshop stood a great old willow tree , that seemed to cling fast to the house , for fear of being carried away by the water , and which stretched forth its branches over the river , just as the willow at person_2 spread its arms across the streamlet by the gardens there.\n", "Yes , he had certainly gone from the `` Elder-mother\"\n", "to the `` Willow-father\"\n", "The tree here had something , especially on moonlight evenings , that went straight to his heart -- and that something was not in the moonlight , but in the old tree itself.\n", "Nevertheless , he could not remain.\n", "Why not ? Ask the willow tree , ask the blooming elder ! And therefore he bade farewell to his master in Nuremberg , and journeyed onward.\n", "To no one did he speak of person_1 -- in his secret heart he hid his sorrow ; and he thought of the deep meaning in the old childish story of the two cakes.\n", "Now he understood why the man had a bitter almond in his breast -- he himself felt the bitterness of it ; and person_1 , who was always so gentle and kind , was typified by the honey-cake.\n", "The strap of his knapsack seemed so tight across his chest that he could scarcely breathe ; he loosened it , but was not relieved.\n", "He saw but half the world around him ; the other half he carried about him , and within himself.\n", "And thus it stood with him.\n", "Not till he came in sight of the high mountains did the world appear freer to him ; and now his thoughts were turned without , and tears came into his eyes.\n", "The Alps appeared to him as the folded wings of the earth ; how if they were to unfold themselves , and display their variegated pictures of black woods , foaming waters , clouds , and masses of snow ? At the last day , he thought , the world will lift up its great wings , and mount upwards towards the sky , and burst like a soap-bubble in the glance of the Highest ! `` Ah ,\"\n", "sighed he , `` that the Last Day were come !\"\n", "Silently he wandered through the land , that seemed to him as an orchard covered with soft turf.\n", "From the wooden balconies of the houses the girls who sat busy with their lace-making nodded at him ; the summits of the mountains glowed in the red sun of the evening ; and when he saw the green lakes gleaming among the dark trees , he thought of the coast by the Bay of person_2 , and there was a longing in his bosom , but it was pain no more.\n", "There where the Rhine rolls onward like a great billow , and bursts , and is changed into snow-white , gleaming , cloud-like masses , as if clouds were being created there , with the rainbow fluttering like a loose band above them ; there he thought of the water-mill at person_2 , with its rushing , foaming water.\n", "Gladly would he have remained in the quiet Rhenish town , but here too were too many elder trees and willows , and therefore he journeyed on , over the high , mighty mountains , through shattered walls of rock , and on roads that clung like swallows ' nests to the mountain-side.\n", "The waters foamed on in the depths , the clouds were below him , and he strode on over thistles , Alpine roses , and snow , in the warm summer sun ; and saying farewell to the lands of the North , he passed on under the shade of blooming chestnut trees , and through vineyards and fields of maize.\n", "The mountains were a wall between him and all his recollections ; and he wished it to be so.\n", "Before him lay a great glorious city which they called _ Milano _ , and here he found a German master who gave him work.\n", "They were an old pious couple , in whose workshop he now labored.\n", "And the two old people became quite fond of the quiet journeyman , who said little , but worked all the more , and led a pious Christian life.\n", "To himself also it seemed as if Heaven had lifted the heavy burden from his heart.\n", "His favorite pastime was to mount now and then upon the mighty marble church , which seemed to him to have been formed of the snow of his native land , fashioned into roofs , and pinnacles , and decorated open halls : from every corner and every point the white statues smiled upon him.\n", "Above him was the blue sky , below him the city and the wide-spreading Lombard plains , and towards the north the high mountains clad with perpetual snow ; and he thought of the church at person_2 , with its red , ivy-covered walls , but he did not long to go thither : here , beyond the mountains , he would be buried.\n", "He had dwelt here a year , and three years had passed away since he left his home , when one day his master took him into the city , not to the circus where riders exhibited , but to the opera , where was a hall worth seeing.\n", "There were seven storeys , from each of which beautiful silken curtains hung down , and from the ground to the dizzy height of the roof sat elegant ladies , with bouquets of flowers in their hands , as if they were at a ball , and the gentlemen were in full dress , and many of them decorated with gold and silver.\n", "It was as bright there as in the brilliant sunshine , and the music rolled gloriously through the building.\n", "Everything was much more splendid than in the theater at Copenhagen , but then person_1 had been there , and -- could it be ? Yes , it was like magic -- she was here also ! for the curtain rose , and person_1 appeared , dressed in silk and gold , with a crown upon her head : she sang as he thought none but angels could sing , and came far forward , quite to the front of the stage , and smiled as only person_1 could smile , and looked straight down at person_0.\n", "Poor person_0 seized his master 's hand , and called out aloud , `` person_1 !\"\n", "but no one heard but the master , who nodded his head , for the loud music sounded above everything.\n", "`` Yes , yes , her name is person_1 ,\"\n", "said the master ; and he drew forth a printed playbill , and showed person_0 her name -- for the full name was printed there.\n", "No , it was not a dream !

a prosperous man , while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard at Copenhagen , where she had died in poverty.\n", "-LRB- Illustration : LITTLE CHRISTINE.\n", "aaaaa -RRB- aaa person_1 had money , and was said to have provided for the future.\n", "He had won gold out of the black earth , and he had a person_0 for his own , after all\"\n", "The insignia of the great Japanese Empire is composed of three treasures which have been considered sacred , and guarded with jealous care from time immemorial.\n", "These are the Yatano-no-Kagami or the Mirror of Yata , the Yasakami-no-Magatama or the Jewel of Yasakami , and the person_7-no-Tsurugi or the Sword of person_7.\n", "Of these three treasures of the Empire , the sword of person_7 , afterwards known as Kusanagi-no-Tsrugugi , or the grass-cleaving sword , is considered the most precious and most highly to be honored , for it is the symbol of strength to this nation of warriors and the talisman of invincibility for the Emperor , while he holds it sacred in the shrine of his ancestors.\n", "Nearly two thousand years ago this sword was kept at the shrines of Ite , the temples dedicated to the worship of Amaterasu , the great and beautiful Sun Goddess from whom the Japanese Emperors are said to be descended.\n", "There is a story of knightly adventure and daring which explains why the name of the sword was changed from that of person_7 to Kasanagi , which means grass clearing.\n", "Once , many , many years ago , there was born a son to the Emperor Keiko , the twelfth in descent from the great Jimmu , the founder of the Japanese dynasty.\n", "This person_2 was the second son of the Emperor Keiko , and he was named person_6.\n", "From his childhood he proved himself to be of remarkable strength , wisdom and courage , and his father noticed with pride that he gave promise of great things , and he loved him even more than he did his elder son.\n", "Now when person_2 had grown to manhood -LRB- in the olden days of Japanese history , a boy was considered to have reached man 's estate at the early age of sixteen -RRB- the realm was much troubled by a band of outlaws whose chiefs were two brothers , Kumaso and person_1.\n", "These rebels seemed to delight in rebelling against the person_3 , in breaking the laws and defying all authority.\n", "At last person_3 Keiko ordered his younger son person_2 to subdue the brigands and , if possible , to rid the land of their evil lives.\n", "person_2 was only sixteen years of age , he had but reached his manhood according to the law , yet though he was such a youth in years he possessed the dauntless spirit of a warrior of fuller age and knew not what fear was.\n", "Even then there was no man who could rival him for courage and bold deeds , and he received his father 's command with great joy.\n", "He at once made ready to start , and great was the stir in the precincts of the Palace as he and his trusty followers gathered together and prepared for the expedition , and polished up their armor and donned it.\n", "Before he left his father 's Court he went to pray at the shrine of Ise and to take leave of his aunt the person_5 , for his heart was somewhat heavy at the thought of the dangers he had to face , and he felt that he needed the protection of his ancestress , Amaterasu , the Sun Goddess.\n", "The person_5 his aunt came out to give him glad welcome , and congratulated him on being trusted with so great a mission by his father the person_3.\n", "She then gave him one of her gorgeous robes as a keepsake to go with him and to bring him good luck , saying that it would surely be of service to him on this adventure.\n", "She then wished him all success in his undertaking and bade him good speed.\n", "The young person_2 bowed low before his aunt , and received her gracious gift with much pleasure and many respectful bows.\n", "`` I will now set out ,\"\n", "said the person_2 , and returning to the Palace he put himself at the head of his troops.\n", "Thus cheered by his aunt 's blessing , he felt ready for all that might befall , and marching through the land he went down to the Southern Island of Kiushiu , the home of the brigands.\n", "Before many days had passed he reached the Southern Island , and then slowly but surely made his way to the head-quarters of the chiefs Kumaso and person_1.\n", "He now met with great difficulties , for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough.\n", "The mountains were high and steep , the valleys dark and deep , and huge trees and bowlders of rock blocked up the road and stopped the progress of his army.\n", "It was all but impossible to go on.\n", "Though the person_2 was but a youth he had the wisdom of years , and , seeing that it was vain to try and lead his men further , he said to himself : `` To attempt to fight a battle in this impassable country unknown to my men only makes my task harder.\n", "We can not clear the roads and fight as well.\n", "It is wiser for me to resort to stratagem and come upon my enemies unawares.\n", "In that way I may be able to kill them without much exertion\"\n", "So he now bade his army halt by the way.\n", "His wife , the person_5 , had accompanied him , and he bade her bring him the robe his aunt the priestess of Ise had given him , and to help him attire himself as a woman.\n", "With her help he put on the robe , and let his hair down till it flowed over his shoulders.\n", "person_4 then brought him her comb , which he put in his black tresses , and then adorned himself with strings of strange jewels just as you see in the picture.\n", "When he had finished his unusual toilet , person_4 brought him her mirror.\n", "He smiled as he gazed at himself -- the disguise was so perfect.\n", "He hardly knew himself , so changed was he.\n", "All traces of the warrior had disappeared , and in the shining surface only a beautiful lady looked back at him.\n", "Thus completely disguised , he set out for the enemy 's camp alone.\n", "In the folds of his silk gown , next his strong heart , was hidden a sharp dagger.\n", "The two chiefs Kumaso and person_1 wore sitting in their tent , resting in the cool of the evening , when the person_2 approached.\n", "They were talking of the news which had recently been carried to them , that the person_3 's son had entered their country with a large army determined to exterminate their band.\n", "They had both heard of the young warrior 's renown , and for the first time in their wicked lives they felt afraid.\n", "In a pause in their talk they happened to look up , and saw through the door of the tent a beautiful woman robed in sumptuous garments coming towards them.\n", "Like an apparition of loveliness she appeared in the soft twilight.\n", "Little did they dream that it was their enemy whose coming they so dreaded who now stood before them in this disguise.\n", "`` What a beautiful woman ! Where has she come from ?\"\n", "said the astonished Kumaso , forgetting war and council and everything as he looked at the gentle intruder.\n", "He beckoned to the disguised person_2 and bade him sit down and serve them with wine.\n", "person_6 felt his heart swell with a fierce glee for he now knew that his plan would succeed.\n", "However , he dissembled cleverly , and putting on a sweet air of shyness he approached the rebel chief with slow steps and eyes glancing like a frightened deer.\n", "Charmed to distraction by the girl 's loveliness Kumaso drank cup after cup of wine for the pleasure of seeing her pour it out for him , till at last he was quite overcome with the quantity he had drunk.\n", "This was the moment for which the brave person_2 had been waiting.\n", "Flinging down the wine jar , he seized the tipsy and astonished Kumaso and quickly stabbed him to death with the dagger which he had secretly carried hidden in his breast.\n", "person_1 , the brigand 's brother , was terror-struck as soon as he saw what was happening and tried to escape , but person_2 was too quick for him.\n", "Ere he could reach the tent door the person_2 was at his heel , his garments were clutched by a hand of iron , and a dagger flashed before his eyes and he lay stabbed to the earth , dying but not yet dead.\n", "`` Wait one moment !\"\n", "gasped the brigand painfully , and he seized the person_2 's hand.\n", "person_6 relaxed his hold somewhat and said.\n", "`` Why should I pause , thou villain ?\"\n", "The brigand raised himself fearfully and said : `` Tell me from whence you come , and whom I have the honor of addressing ? Hitherto I believed that my dead brother and I were the strongest men in the land , and that there was no one who could overcome us.\n", "Alone you have ventured into our stronghold , alone you have attacked and killed us ! Surely you are more than mortal ?\"\n", "Then the young person_2 answered with a proud smile : -- `` I am the son of the person_3 and my name is person_6 , and I have been sent by my father as the avenger of evil to bring death to all rebels ! No longer shall robbery and murder hold my people in terror !\"\n", "and he held the dagger dripping red above the rebel 's head.\n", "`` Ah ,\"\n", "gasped the dying man with a great effort , `` I have often heard of you.\n", "You are indeed a strong man to have so easily overcome us.\n", "Allow me to give you a new name.\n", "From henceforth you shall be known as person_6.\n", "Our title I bequeath to you as the bravest man in person_6\"\n", "And with these noble words , person_1 fell back and died.\n", "The person_2 having thus successfully put an end to his father 's enemies in the world , was prepared to return to the capital.\n", "On the way back he passed through the province of Idum.\n", "Here he met with another outlaw named Idzumo person_1 who he knew had done much harm in the land.\n", "He again resorted to stratagem , and feigned friendship with the rebel under an assumed name.\n", "Having done this he made a sword of wood and jammed it tightly in the shaft of his own strong sword.\n", "This he purposedly buckled to his side and wore on every occasion when he expected to meet the third robber person_1 , He now invited person_1 to the bank of the River Hinokawa , and persuaded him to try a swim with him in the cool refreshing waters of the river.\n", "As it was a hot summer 's day , the rebel was nothing loath to take a plunge in the river , while his enemy was still swimming down the stream the person_2 turned back and landed with all possible haste.\n", "Unperceived , he managed to change swords , putting his wooden one in place of the keen steel sword of person_1.\n", "Knowing nothing of this , the brigand came up to the bank shortly.\n", "As soon as he had landed and donned his clothes , the person_2 came forward and asked him to cross swords with him to prove his skill , saying : `` Let us two prove which is the better swordsman of the two !\"\n", "The robber agreed with delight , feeling certain of victory , for he was famous as a fencer in his province and he did not know who his adversary was.\n", "He seized quickly what he thought was his sword and stood on guard to defend himself.\n", "Alas ! for the rebel the sword was the wooden one of the young person_2 and in vain person_1 tried to unsheathe it -- it was jammed fast , not all his exerted strength could move it.\n", "Even if his efforts had been successful the sword would have been of no use to him for it was of wood.\n", "person_6 saw that his enemy was in his power , and swinging high the sword he had taken from person_1 he brought it down with great might and dexterity and cut off the robber 's head.\n", "In this way , sometimes by using his wisdom and sometimes by using his bodily strength , and at other times by resorting to craftiness , which was as much esteemed in those days as it is despised in these , he prevailed against all the person_3 's foes one by one , and brought peace and rest to the land and the people.\n", "When he returned to the capital the person_3 praised him for his brave deeds , and held a feast in the Palace in honor of his safe coming home and presented him with many rare gifts.\n", "From this time forth the person_3 loved him more than ever and would not let person_6 go from his side , for he said that his son was now as precious to him as one of his arms.\n", "But the person_2 was not allowed to live an idle life long.\n", "When he was about thirty years old , news was brought that the Ainu race , the aborigines of the islands of Japan , who had been conquered and pushed northwards by the Japanese , had rebelled in the Eastern provinces , and leaving the vicinity which had been allotted to them were causing great trouble in the land.\n", "The person_3 decided that it was necessary to send an army to do battle with them and bring them to reason.\n", "But who was to lead the men ? person_2 person_0 at once offered to go and bring the newly arisen rebels into subjection.\n", "Now as the person_3 loved the person_2 dearly , and could not bear to have him go out of his sight even for the length of one day , he was of course very loath to send him on his dangerous expedition.\n", "But in the whole army there was no warrior so strong or so brave as the person_2 his son , so that His Majesty , unable to do otherwise , reluctantly complied with person_6 's wish.\n", "When the time came for the person_2 to start , the person_3 gave him a spear called the Eight-Arms-Length-Spear of the Holly Tree -LRB- the handle was probably made from the wood of the holly tree -RRB- , and ordered him to set out to subjugate the Eastern Barbarians as the Ainu were then called.\n", "The Eight-Arms-Length-Spear of the Holly Tree of those old days , was prized by warriors just as much as the Standard or Banner is valued by a regiment in these modern days , when given by the person_3 to his soldiers on the occasion of setting out for war.\n", "The person_2 respectfully and with great reverence received the person_3 's spear , and leaving the capital , marched with his army to the East.\n", "On his way he visited first of all the temples of Ise for worship , and his aunt the person_5 of person_6 and High Priestess came out to greet him.\n", "She it was who had given him her robe which had proved such a boon to him before in helping him to overcome and slay the brigands of the West.\n", "He told her all that had happened to him , and of the great part her keepsake had played in the success of his previous undertaking , and thanked her very heartily.\n", "When she heard that he was starting out once again to do battle with his father 's enemies , she went into the temple , and reappeared bearing a sword and a beautiful bag which she had made herself , and which was full of flints , which in those times people used instead of matches for making fire.\n", "These she presented to him as a parting gift.\n", "The sword was the sword of person_7 , one of the three sacred treasures which comprise the insignia of the Imperial House of Japan.\n", "No more auspicious talisman of luck and success could she have given her nephew , and she bade him use it in the hour of his greatest need.\n", "person_6 now bade farewell to his aunt , and once more placing himself at the head of his men he marched to the farthest East through the province of Owari , and then he reached the province of Suruga.\n", "Here the governor welcomed the person_2 right heartily and entertained him royally with many feasts.\n", "When these were over , the governor told his guest that his country was famous for its fine deer , and proposed a deer hunt for the person_2 's amusement.\n", "The person_2 was utterly deceived by the cordiality of his host , which was all feigned , and gladly consented to join in the hunt.\n", "The governor then led the person_2 to a wild and extensive plain where the grass grew high and in great abundance.\n", "Quite ignorant that the governor had laid a trap for him with the desire to compass his death , the person_2 began to ride hard and hunt down the deer , when all of a sudden to his amazement he saw flames and smoke bursting out from the bush in front of him.\n", "Realizing his danger he tried to retreat , but no sooner did he turn his horse in the opposite direction than he saw that even there the prairie was on fire.\n", "At the same time the grass on his left and right burst into flames , and these began to spread swiftly towards him on all sides.\n", "He looked round for a chance of escape.\n", "There was none.\n", "He was surrounded by fire.\n", "`` This deer hunt was then only a cunning trick of the enemy !\"\n", "said the person_2 , looking round on the flames and the smoke that crackled and rolled in towards him on every side.\n", "`` What a fool I was to be lured into this trap like a wild beast !\"\n", "and he ground his teeth with rage as he thought of the governor 's smiling treachery.\n", "Dangerous as was his situation now , the person_2 was not in the least confounded.\n", "In his dire extremity he remembered the gifts his aunt had given him when they parted , and it seemed to him as if she must , with prophetic foresight , have divined this hour of need.\n", "He coolly opened the flint-bag that his aunt had given him and set fire to the grass near him.\n", "Then drawing the sword of person_7 from its sheath he set to work to cut down the grass on either side of him with all speed.\n", "He determined to die , if that were necessary , fighting for his life and not standing still waiting for death to come to him.\n", "Strange to say the wind began to change and to blow from the opposite direction , and the fiercest portion of the burning bush which had hitherto threatened to come upon him was now blown right away from him , and the person_2 , without even a scratch on his body or a single hair burned , lived to tell the tale of his wonderful escape , while the wind rising to a gale overtook the governor , and he was burned to death in the flames he had set alight to kill person_6.\n", "Now the person_2 ascribed his escape entirely to the virtue of the sword of person_7 , and to the protection of Amaterasu , the Sun Goddess of Ise , who controls the wind and all the elements and insures the safety of all who pray to her in the hour of danger.\n", "Lifting the precious sword he raised it above his head many times in token of his great respect , and as he did this he re-named it Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi or the Grass-Cleaving Sword , and the place where he set fire to the grass round him and escaped from death in the burning prairie , he called Yaidzu.\n", "To this day there is a spot along the great Tokaido railway named Yaidzu , which is said to be the very place where this thrilling event took place.\n", "Thus did the brave person_2 person_0 escape out of the snare laid for him by his enemy.\n", "He was full of resource and courage , and finally outwitted and subdued all his foes.\n", "Leaving Yaidzu he marched eastward , and came to the shore at Idzu from whence he wished to cross to Kadzusa.\n", "In these dangers and adventures he had been followed by his faithful loving wife the person_5.\n", "For his sake she counted the weariness of the long journeys and the dangers of war as nothing , and her love for her warrior husband was so great that she felt well repaid for all her wanderings if she could but hand him his sword when he sallied forth to battle , or minister to his wants when he returned weary to the camp.\n", "But the heart of the person_2 was full of war and conquest and he cared little for the faithful person_4.\n", "From long exposure in traveling , and from care and grief at her lord 's coldness to her , her beauty had faded , and her ivory skin was burnt brown by the sun , and the person_2 told her one day that her place was in the Palace behind the screens at home and not with him upon the warpath.\n", "But in spite of rebuffs and indifference on her husband 's part , person_4 could not find it in her heart to leave him.\n", "But perhaps it would have been better for her if she had done so , for on the way to Idzu , when they came to Owari , her heart was well-nigh broken.\n", "Here dwelt in a Palace shaded by pine-trees and approached by imposing gates , the person_5 Miyadzu , beautiful as the cherry blossom in the blushing dawn of a spring morning.\n", "Her garments were dainty and bright , and her skin was white as snow , for she had never known what it was to be weary along the path of duty or to walk in the heat of a summer 's sun.\n", "And the person_2 was ashamed of his sunburnt wife in her travel-stained garments , and bade her remain behind while he went to visit the person_5 Miyadzu.\n", "Day after day he spent hours in the gardens and the Palace of his new friend , thinking only of his pleasure , and caring little for his poor wife who remained behind to weep in the tent at the misery which had come into her life.\n", "Yet she was so faithful a wife , and her character so patient , that she never allowed a reproach to escape her lips , or a frown to mar the sweet sadness of her face , and she was ever ready with a smile to welcome her husband back or usher him forth wherever he went.\n", "At last the day came when the person_2 person_0 must depart for Idzu and cross over the sea to Kadzusa , and he bade his wife follow in his retinue as an attendant while he went to take a ceremonious farewell of the person_5 Miyadzu.\n", "She came out to greet him dressed in gorgeous robes , and she seemed more beautiful than ever , and when person_6 saw her he forgot his wife , his duty , and everything except the joy of the idle present , and swore that he would return to Owari and marry her when the war was over.\n", "And as he looked up when he had said these words he met the large almond eyes of person_4 fixed full upon him in unspeakable sadness and wonder , and he knew that he had done wrong , hut he hardened his heart and rode on , caring little for the pain he had caused her.\n", "When they reached the seashore at Idzu his men sought for boats in which to cross the straits to Kadzusa , but it was difficult to find boats enough to allow all the soldiers to embark.\n", "Then the person_2 stood on the beach , and in the pride of his strength he scoffed and said : `` This is not the sea ! This is only a brook ! Why do you men want so many boats ? I could jump this if I would\"\n", "When at last they had all embarked and were fairly on their way across the straits , the sky suddenly clouded and a great storm arose.\n", "The waves rose mountains high , the wind howled , the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled , and the boat which held person_4 and the person_2 and his men was tossed from crest to crest of the rolling waves , till it seemed that every moment must be their last and that they must all be swallowed up in the angry sea.\n", "For Kin Jin.\n", "the Dragon person_3 of the Sea , had heard person_6 jeer , and had raised this terrible storm in anger , to show the scoffing person_2 how awful the sea could be though it did but look like a brook.\n", "The terrified crew lowered the sails and looked after the rudder , and worked for their dear lives ' sake , but all in vain -- the storm only seemed to increase in violence , and all gave themselves up for lost.\n", "Then the faithful person_4 rose , and forgetting all the grief that her husband had caused her , forgetting even that he had wearied of her , in the one great desire of her love to save him , she determined to sacrifice her life to rescue him from death if it were possible.\n", "While the waves dashed over the ship and the wind whirled round them in fury she stood up and said : `` Surely all this has come because the person_2 has angered Rin Jin , the God of the Sea , by his jesting.\n", "If so , I , person_4 , will appease the wrath of the Sea God who desires nothing less than my husband 's life !\"\n", "Then addressing the sea she said : `` I will take the place of His Augustness , person_6.\n", "I will now cast myself into your outraged depths , giving my life for his.\n", "Therefore hear me and bring him safely to the shore of Kadzusa\"\n", "With these words she leaped quickly into the boisterous sea , and the waves soon whirled her away and she was lost to sight.\n", "Strange to say , the storm ceased at once , and the sea became as calm and smooth as the matting on which the astonished onlookers were sitting.\n", "The gods of the sea were now appeased , and the weather cleared and the sun shone as on a summer 's day.\n", "person_6 soon reached the opposite shore and landed safely , even as his wife person_4 had prayed.\n", "His prowess in war was marvelous , and he succeeded after some time in conquering the Eastern Barbarians , the Ainu.\n", "He ascribed his safe landing wholly to the faithfulness of his wife , who had so willingly and lovingly sacrificed herself in the hour of his utmost peril.\n", "His heart was softened at the remembrance of her , and he never allowed her to pass from his thoughts even for a moment.\n", "Too late had he learned to esteem the goodness of her heart and the greatness of her love for him.\n", "As he was returning on his homeward way he came to the high pass of the Usui Toge , and here he stood and gazed at the wonderful prospect beneath him.\n", "The country , from this great elevation , all lay open to his sight , a vast panorama of mountain and plain and forest , with rivers winding like silver ribbons through the land ; then far off he saw the distant sea , which shimmered like a luminous mist in the great distance , where person_4 had given her life for him , and as he turned towards it he stretched out his arms , and thinking of her love which he had scorned and his faithlessness to her , his heart burst out into a sorrowful and bitter cry : `` Azuma , Azuma , Ya !\"\n", "-LRB- Oh ! my wife , my wife ! -RRB- And to this day there is a district in Tokio called Azuma , which commemorates the words of person_2 person_0 , and the place where his faithful wife leapt into the sea to save him is still pointed out.\n", "So , though in life the person_5 was unhappy , history keeps her memory green , and the story of her unselfishness and heroic death will never pass away.\n", "person_6 had now fulfilled all his father 's orders , he had subdued all rebels , and rid the land of all robbers and enemies to the peace , and his renown was great , for in the whole land there was no one who could stand up against him , he was so strong in battle and wise in council.\n", "He was about to return straight for home by the way he had come , when the thought struck him that he would find it more interesting to take another route , so he passed through the province of Owari and came to the province of Omi.\n", "When the person_2 reached Omi he found the people in a state of great excitement and fear.\n", "In many houses as he passed along he saw the signs of mourning and heard loud lamentations.\n", "On inquiring the cause of this he was told that a terrible monster had appeared in the mountains , who daily came down from thence and made raids on the villages , devouring whoever he could seize.\n", "Many homes had been made desolate and the men were afraid to go out to their daily work in the fields , or the women to go to the rivers to wash their rice.\n", "When person_6 heard this his wrath was kindled , and he said fiercely : `` From the western end of Kiushiu to the eastern corner of Yezo I have subdued all the person_3 's enemies -- there is no one who dares to break the laws or to rebel against the person_3.\n", "It.\n", "is indeed a matter for wonder that here in this place , so near the capital , a wicked monster has dared to take up his abode and be the terror of the person_3 's subjects.\n", "Not long shall it find pleasure in devouring innocent folk.\n", "I will start out and kill it at once\"\n", "With these words he set out for the Ibuki Mountain , where the monster was said to live.\n", "He climbed up a good distance , when all of a sudden , at a winding in the path , a monster serpent appeared before him and stopped the way.\n", "`` This must be the monster ,\"\n", "said the person_2 ; `` I do not need my sword for a serpent.\n", "I can kill him with my hands\"\n", "He thereupon sprang upon the serpent and tried to strangle it to death with his bare arms.\n", "It was not long before his prodigious strength gained the mastery and the serpent lay dead at his feet.\n", "Now a sudden darkness came over the mountain and rain began to fall , so that for the gloom and the rain the person_2 could hardly see which way to take.\n", "In a short time , however , while he was groping his way down the pass , the weather cleared , and our brave hero was able to make his way quickly down the mountain.\n", "When be got back he began to feel ill and to have burning pains in his feet , so he knew that the serpent had poisoned him.\n", "So great was his suffering that he could hardly move , much less walk , so he had himself carried to a place in the mountains famous for its hot mineral springs , which rose bubbling out of the earth , and almost boiling from the volcanic fires beneath.\n", "person_6 bathed daily in these waters , and gradually he felt his strength come again , and the pains left him , till at last one day he found with great joy that he was quite recovered.\n", "He now hastened to the temples of Ise , where you will remember that he prayed before undertaking this long expedition.\n", "His aunt , priestess of the shrine , who had blessed him on his setting out , now came to welcome him back.\n", "He told her of the many dangers he had encountered and of how marvelously his life had been preserved through all -- and she praised his courage and his warrior 's prowess , and then putting on her most magnificent robes she returned thanks to their ancestress the Sun Goddess Amaterasu , to whose protection they both ascribed the person_2 's wonderful preservation.\n", "Here ends the story of person_2 person_0 of Japan\"\n", "Long , long ago , there lived an old bamboo wood-cutter.\n", "He was very poor and sad also , for no child had Heaven sent to cheer his old age , and in his heart there was no hope of rest from work till he died and was laid in the quiet grave.\n", "Every morning he went forth into the woods and hills wherever the bamboo reared its lithe green plumes against the sky.\n", "When he had made his choice , he would cut down these feathers of the forest , and splitting them lengthwise , or cutting them into joints , would carry the bamboo wood home and make it into various articles for the household , and he and his old wife gained a small livelihood by selling them.\n", "One morning as usual he had gone out to his work , and having found a nice clump of bamboos , had set to work to cut some of them down.\n", "Suddenly the green grove of bamboos was flooded with a bright soft light , as if the full moon had risen over the spot.\n", "Looking round in astonishment , he saw that the brilliance was streaming from one bamboo.\n", "The old man.\n", "full of wonder.\n", "dropped his ax and went towards the light.\n", "On nearer approach he saw that this soft splendor came from a hollow in the green bamboo stem , and still more wonderful to behold , in the midst of the brilliance stood a tiny human being , only three inches in height , and exquisitely beautiful in appearance.\n", "`` You must be sent to be my child , for I find you here among the bamboos where lies my daily work ,\"\n", "said the old man , and taking the little creature in his hand he took it home to his wife to bring up.\n", "The tiny girl was so exceedingly beautiful and so small , that the old woman put her into a basket to safeguard her from the least possibility of being hurt in any way.\n", "The old couple were now very happy , for it had been a lifelong regret that they had no children of their own , and with joy they now expended all the love of their old age on the little child who had come to them in so marvelous a manner.\n", "From this time on , the old man often found gold in the notches of the bamboos when he hewed them down and cut them up ; not only gold , but precious stones also , so that by degrees he became rich.\n", "He built himself a fine house , and was no longer known as the poor bamboo woodcutter , but as a wealthy man.\n", "Three months passed quickly away , and in that time the bamboo child had , wonderful to say , become a full-grown girl , so her foster - parents did up her hair and dressed her in beautiful kimonos.\n", "She was of such wondrous beauty that they placed her behind the screens like a princess , and allowed no one to see her , waiting upon her themselves.\n", "It seemed as if she were made of light , for the house was filled with a soft shining , so that even in the dark of night it was like daytime.\n", "Her presence seemed to have a benign influence on those there.\n", "Whenever the old man felt sad , he had only to look upon his foster-daughter and his sorrow vanished , and he became as happy as when he was a youth.\n", "At last the day came for the naming of their new-found child , so the old couple called in a celebrated name-giver , and he gave her the name of person_0 , because her body gave forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the Moon God.\n", "For three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music.\n", "All the friends and relations of the old couple were present , and great was their enjoyment of the festivities held to celebrate the naming of person_0.\n", "Everyone who saw her declared that there never had been seen any one so lovely ; all the beauties throughout the length and breadth of the land would grow pale beside her , so they said.\n", "The fame of the person_0 's loveliness spread far and wide , and many were the suitors who desired to win her hand , or even so much as to see her.\n", "Suitors from far and near posted themselves outside the house , and made little holes in the fence , in the hope of catching a glimpse of the person_0 as she went from one room to the other along the veranda.\n", "They stayed there day and night , sacrificing even their sleep for a chance of seeing her , but all in vain.\n", "Then they approached the house , and tried to speak to the old man and his wife or some of the servants , but not even this was granted them.\n", "Still , in spite of all this disappointment they stayed on day after day , and night after night , and counted it as nothing , so great was their desire to see the person_0.\n", "At last , however , most of the men , seeing how hopeless their quest was , lost heart and hope both , and returned to their homes.\n", "All except five person_1s , whose ardor and determination , instead of waning , seemed to wax greater with obstacles.\n", "These five men even went without their meals , and took snatches of whatever they could get brought to them , so that they might always stand outside the dwelling.\n", "They stood there in all weathers , in sunshine and in rain.\n", "Sometimes they wrote letters to the person_0 , but no answer was vouchsafed to them.\n", "Then when letters failed to draw any reply , they wrote poems to her telling her of the hopeless love which kept them from sleep , from food , from rest , and even from their homes.\n", "Still Princes person_2 gave no sign of having received their verses.\n", "In this hopeless state the winter passed.\n", "The snow and frost and the cold winds gradually gave place to the gentle warmth of spring.\n", "Then the summer came , and the sun burned white and scorching in the heavens above and on the earth beneath , and still these faithful person_1s kept watch and waited.\n", "At the end of these long months they called out to the old bamboo-cutter and entreated him to have some mercy upon them and to show them the person_0 , but he answered only that as he was not her real father he could not insist on her obeying him against her wishes.\n", "The five person_1s on receiving this stern answer returned to their several homes , and pondered over the best means of touching the proud person_0 's heart , even so much as to grant them a hearing.\n", "They took their rosaries in hand and knelt before their household shrines , and burned precious incense , praying to Buddha to give them their heart 's desire.\n", "Thus several days passed , but even so they could not rest in their homes.\n", "So again they set out for the bamboo-cutter 's house.\n", "This time the old man came out to see them , and they asked him to let them know if it was the person_0 's resolution never to see any man whatsoever , and they implored him to speak for them and to tell her the greatness of their love , and how long they had waited through the cold of winter and the heat of summer , sleepless and roofless through all weathers , without food and without rest , in the ardent hope of winning her , and they were willing to consider this long vigil as pleasure if she would but give them one chance of pleading their cause with her.\n", "The old man lent a willing ear to their tale of love , for in his inmost heart he felt sorry for these faithful suitors and would have liked to see his lovely foster-daughter married to one of them.\n", "So he went in to person_0 and said reverently : `` Although you have always seemed to me to be a heavenly being , yet I have had the trouble of bringing you up as my own child and you have been glad of the protection of my roof.\n", "Will you refuse to do as I wish ?\"\n", "Then person_0 replied that there was nothing she would not do for him , that she honored and loved him as her own father , and that as for herself she could not remember the time before she came to earth.\n", "The old man listened with great joy as she spoke these dutiful words.\n", "Then he told her how anxious he was to see her safely and happily married before he died.\n", "`` I am an old man , over seventy years of age , and my end may come any time now.\n", "It is necessary and right that you should see these five suitors and choose one of them\"\n", "`` Oh , why ,\"\n", "said the person_0 in distress , `` must I do this ? I have no wish to marry now\"\n", "`` I found you ,\"\n", "answered the old man , `` many years ago , when you were a little creature three inches high , in the midst of a great white light.\n", "The light streamed from the bamboo in which you were hid and led me to you.\n", "So I have always thought that you were more than mortal woman.\n", "While I am alive it is right for you to remain as you are if you wish to do so , but some day I shall cease to be and who will take care of you then ? Therefore I pray you to meet these five brave men one at a time and make up your mind to marry one of them !\"\n", "Then the person_0 answered that she felt sure that she was not as beautiful as perhaps report made her out to be , and that even if she consented to marry any one of them , not really knowing her before , his heart might change afterwards.\n", "So as she did not feel sure of them , even though her father told her they were worthy person_1s , she did not feel it wise to see them.\n", "`` All you say is very reasonable ,\"\n", "said the old man , `` but what kind of men will you consent to see ? I do not call these five men who have waited on you for months , light-hearted.\n", "They have stood outside this house through the winter and the summer , often denying themselves food and sleep so that they may win you.\n", "What more can you demand ?\"\n", "Then person_0 said she must make further trial of their love before she would grant their request to interview her.\n", "The five warriors were to prove their love by each bringing her from distant countries something that she desired to possess.\n", "That same evening the suitors arrived and began to play their flutes in turn , and to sing their self-composed songs telling of their great and tireless love.\n", "The bamboo-cutter went out to them and offered them his sympathy for all they had endured and all the patience they had shown in their desire to win his foster-daughter.\n", "Then he gave them her message , that she would consent to marry whosoever was successful in bringing her what she wanted.\n", "This was to test them.\n", "The five all accepted the trial , and thought it an excellent plan , for it would prevent jealousy between them.\n", "person_0 then sent word to the First person_1 that she requested him to bring her the stone bowl which had belonged to Buddha in India.\n", "The Second person_1 was asked to go to the Mountain of Horai , said to be situated in the Eastern Sea , and to bring her a branch of the wonderful tree that grew on its summit.\n", "The roots of this tree were of silver , the trunk of gold , and the branches bore as fruit white jewels.\n", "The Third person_1 was told to go to China and search for the fire-rat and to bring her its skin.\n", "The Fourth person_1 was told to search for the dragon that carried on its head the stone radiating five colors and to bring the stone to her.\n", "The Fifth person_1 was to find the swallow which carried a shell in its stomach and to bring the shell to her.\n", "The old man thought these very hard tasks and hesitated to carry the messages , but the person_0 would make no other conditions.\n", "So her commands were issued word for word to the five men who , when they heard what was required of them , were all disheartened and disgusted at what seemed to them the impossibility of the tasks given them and returned to their own homes in despair.\n", "But after a time , when they thought of the person_0 , the love in their hearts revived for her , and they resolved to make an attempt to get what she desired of them.\n", "The First person_1 sent word to the person_0 that he was starting out that day on the quest of Buddha 's bowl , and he hoped soon to bring it to her.\n", "But he had not the courage to go all the way to India , for in those days traveling was very difficult and full of danger , so he went to one of the temples in Kyoto and took a stone bowl from the altar there , paying the priest a large sum of money for it.\n", "He then wrapped it in a cloth of gold and , waiting quietly for three years , returned and carried it to the old man.\n", "person_0 wondered that the person_1 should have returned so soon.\n", "She took the bowl from its gold wrapping , expecting it to make the room full of light , but it did not shine at all , so she knew that it was a sham thing and not the true bowl of Buddha.\n", "She returned it at once and refused to see him.\n", "The person_1 threw the bowl away and returned to his home in despair.\n", "He gave up now all hopes of ever winning the person_0.\n", "The Second person_1 told his parents that he needed change of air for his health , for he was ashamed to tell them that love for the person_0 was the real cause of his leaving them.\n", "He then left his home , at the same time sending word to the person_0 that he was setting out for Mount Horai in the hope of getting her a branch of the gold and silver tree which she so much wished to have.\n", "He only allowed his servants to accompany him half-way , and then sent them back.\n", "He reached the seashore and embarked on a small ship , and after sailing away for three days he landed and employed several carpenters to build him a house contrived in such a way that no one could get access to it.\n", "He then shut himself up with six skilled jewelers , and endeavored to make such a gold and silver branch as he thought would satisfy the person_0 as having come from the wonderful tree growing on Mount Horai.\n", "Every one whom he had asked declared that Mount Horai belonged to the land of fable and not to fact.\n", "When the branch was finished , he took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if he were wearied and worn out with travel.\n", "He put the jeweled branch into a lacquer box and carried it to the bamboo-cutter , begging him to present it to the person_0.\n", "The old man was quite deceived by the travel-stained appearance of the person_1 , and thought that he had only just returned from his long journey with the branch.\n", "So he tried to persuade the person_0 to consent to see the man.\n", "But she remained silent and looked very sad.\n", "The old man began to take out the branch and praised it as a wonderful treasure to be found nowhere in the whole land.\n", "Then he spoke of the person_1 , how handsome and how brave he was to have undertaken a journey to so remote a place as the Mount of Horai.\n", "person_0 took the branch in her hand and looked at it carefully.\n", "She then told her foster-parent that she knew it was impossible for the man to have obtained a branch from the gold and silver tree growing on Mount Horai so quickly or so easily , and she was sorry to say she believed it artificial.\n", "The old man then went out to the expectant person_1 , who had now approached the house , and asked where he had found the branch.\n", "Then the man did not scruple to make up a long story.\n", "`` Two years ago I took a ship and started in search of Mount Horai.\n", "After going before the wind for some time I reached the far Eastern Sea.\n", "Then a great storm arose and I was tossed about for many days , losing all count of the points of the compass , and finally we were blown ashore on an unknown island.\n", "Here I found the place inhabited by demons who at one time threatened to kill and eat me.\n", "However , I managed to make friends with these horrible creatures , and they helped me and my sailors to repair the boat , and I set sail again.\n", "Our food gave out , and we suffered much from sickness on board.\n", "At last , on the five-hundredth day from the day of starting , I saw far off on the horizon what looked like the peak of a mountain.\n", "On nearer approach , this proved to be an island , in the center of which rose a high mountain.\n", "I landed , and after wandering about for two or three days , I saw a shining being coming towards me on the beach , holding in his hands a golden bowl.\n", "I went up to him and asked him if I had , by good chance , found the island of Mount Horai , and he answered :\"\n", "` Yes , this is Mount Horai ! '\"\n", "`` With much difficulty I climbed to the summit , here stood the golden tree growing with silver roots in the ground.\n", "The wonders of that strange land are many , and if I began to tell you about them I could never stop.\n", "In spite of my wish to stay there long , on breaking off the branch I hurried back.\n", "With utmost speed it has taken me four hundred days to get back , and , as you see , my clothes are still damp from exposure on the long sea voyage.\n", "I have not even waited to change my raiment , so anxious was I to bring the branch to the person_0 quickly\"\n", "Just at this moment the six jewelers , who had been employed on the making of the branch , but not yet paid by the person_1 , arrived at the house and sent in a petition to the person_0 to be paid for their labor.\n", "They said that they had worked for over a thousand days making the branch of gold , with its silver twigs and its jeweled fruit , that was now presented to her by the person_1 , but as yet they had received nothing in payment.\n", "So this person_1 's deception was thus found out , and the person_0 , glad of an escape from one more importunate suitor , was only too pleased to send back the branch.\n", "She called in the workmen and had them paid liberally , and they went away happy.\n", "But on the way home they were overtaken by the disappointed man.\n", "who beat them till they were nearly dead , for letting out the secret , and they barely escaped with their lives.\n", "The person_1 then returned home , raging in his heart ; and in despair of ever winning the person_0 gave up society and retired to a solitary life among the mountains.\n", "Now the Third person_1 had a friend in China , so he wrote to him to get the skin of the fire-rat.\n", "The virtue of any part of this animal was that no fire could harm it.\n", "He promised his friend any amount of money he liked to ask if only he could get him the desired article.\n", "As soon as the news came that the ship on which his friend had sailed home had come into port , he rode seven days on horseback to meet him.\n", "He handed his friend a large sum of money , and received the fire-rat 's skin.\n", "When he reached home he put it carefully in a box and sent it in to the person_0 while he waited outside for her answer.\n", "The bamboo-cutter took the box from the person_1 and , as usual , carried it in to her and tried to coax her to see the person_1 at once , but person_0 refused , saying that she must first put the skin to test by putting it into the fire.\n", "If it were the real thing it would not burn.\n", "So she took off the crape wrapper and opened the box , and then threw the skin into the fire.\n", "The skin crackled and burnt up at once , and the person_0 knew that this man also had not fulfilled his word.\n", "So the Third person_1 failed also.\n", "Now the Fourth person_1 was no more enterprising than the rest.\n", "Instead of starting out on the quest of the dragon bearing on its head the five-color-radiating jewel , he called all his servants together and gave them the order to seek for it far and wide in Japan and in China , and he strictly forbade any of them to return till they had found it.\n", "His numerous retainers and servants started out in different directions , with no intention , however , of obeying what they considered an impossible order.\n", "They simply took a holiday , went to pleasant country places together , and grumbled at their master 's unreasonableness.\n", "The person_1 meanwhile , thinking that his retainers could not fail to find the jewel , repaired to his house , and fitted it up beautifully for the reception of the person_0 , he felt so sure of winning her.\n", "One year passed away in weary waiting , and still his men did not return with the dragon-jewel.\n", "The person_1 became desperate.\n", "He could wait no longer , so taking with him only two men he hired a ship and commanded the captain to go in search of the dragon ; the captain and the sailors refused to undertake what they said was an absurd search , but the person_1 compelled them at last to put out to sea.\n", "When they had been but a few days out they encountered a great storm which lasted so long that , by the time its fury abated , the person_1 had determined to give up the hunt of the dragon.\n", "They were at last blown on shore , for navigation was primitive in those days.\n", "Worn out with his travels and anxiety , the fourth suitor gave himself up to rest.\n", "He had caught a very heavy cold , and had to go to bed with a swollen face.\n", "The governor of the place , hearing of his plight , sent messengers with a letter inviting him to his house.\n", "While he was there thinking over all his troubles , his love for the person_0 turned to anger , and he blamed her for all the hardships he had undergone.\n", "He thought that it was quite probable she had wished to kill him so that she might be rid of him , and in order to carry out her wish had sent him upon his impossible quest.\n", "At this point all the servants he had sent out to find the jewel came to see him , and were surprised to find praise instead of displeasure awaiting them.\n", "Their master told them that he was heartily sick of adventure , and said that he never intended to go near the person_0 's house again in the future.\n", "Like all the rest , the Fifth person_1 failed in his quest -- he could not find the swallow 's shell.\n", "By this time the fame of person_0 's beauty had reached the ears of the person_3 , and he sent one of the Court ladies to see if she were really as lovely as report said ;

"She looked back , and saw with pity the deep sorrow of the old man.\n", "She spoke to him many comforting words , and told him that it was not her will to leave him and that he must always think of her when looking at the moon.\n", "The bamboo-cutter implored to be allowed to accompany her , but this was not allowed.\n", "The person_0 took off her embroidered outer garment and gave it to him as a keepsake.\n", "One of the moon beings in the chariot held a wonderful coat of wings , another had a phial full of the Elixir of Life which was given the person_0 to drink.\n", "She swallowed a little and was about to give the rest to the old man , but she was prevented from doing so.\n", "The robe of wings was about to be put upon her shoulders , but she said : `` Wait a little.\n", "I must not forget my good friend the person_3.\n", "I must write him once more to say good-by while still in this human form\"\n", "In spite of the impatience of the messengers and charioteers she kept them waiting while she wrote.\n", "She placed the phial of the Elixir of Life with the letter , and , giving them to the old man , she asked him to deliver them to the person_3.\n", "Then the chariot began to roll heavenwards towards the moon , and as they all gazed with tearful eyes at the receding person_0 , the dawn broke , and in the rosy light of day the moon-chariot and all in it were lost amongst the fleecy clouds that were now wafted across the sky on the wings of the morning wind.\n", "person_0 's letter was carried to the Palace.\n", "His Majesty was afraid to touch the Elixir of Life , so he sent it with the letter to the top of the most sacred mountain in the land.\n", "Mount Fuji , and there the Royal emissaries burnt it on the summit at sunrise.\n", "So to this day people say there is smoke to be seen rising from the top of Mount Fuji to the clouds\"\n", "Long , long ago Japan was governed by Hohodemi , the fourth Mikoto -LRB- or Augustness -RRB- in descent from the illustrious Amaterasu , the Sun Goddess.\n", "He was not only as handsome as his ancestress was beautiful , but he was also very strong and brave , and was famous for being the greatest hunter in the land.\n", "Because of his matchless skill as a hunter , he was called `` Yama-sachi-hiko\"\n", "or `` The person_1 of the Mountains\"\n", "His elder brother was a very skillful fisher , and as he far surpassed all rivals in fishing , he was named `` Unii-sachi-hiko\"\n", "or the `` Skillful Fisher of the person_5\"\n", "The brothers thus led happy lives , thoroughly enjoying their respective occupations , and the days passed quickly and pleasantly while each pursued his own way , the one hunting and the other fishing.\n", "One day the person_1 came to his brother , the Skillful Fisher , and said : `` Well , my brother , I see you go to the sea every day with your fishing rod in your hand , and when you return you come laden with fish.\n", "And as for me , it is my pleasure to take my bow and arrow and to hunt the wild animals up the mountains and down in the valleys.\n", "For a long time we have each followed our favorite occupation , so that now we must both be tired , you of your fishing and I of my hunting.\n", "Would it not be wise for us to make a change ? Will you try hunting in the mountains and I will go and fish in the sea ?\"\n", "The Skillful Fisher listened in silence to his brother , and for a moment was thoughtful , but at last he answered : `` O yes , why not ? Your idea is not a bad one at all.\n", "Give me your bow and arrow and I will set out at once for the mountains and hunt for game\"\n", "So the matter was settled by this talk , and the two brothers each started out to try the other 's occupation , little dreaming of all that would happen.\n", "It was very unwise of them , for the person_1 knew nothing of fishing , and the Skillful Fisher , who was bad tempered , knew as much about hunting.\n", "The person_1 took his brother 's much-prized fishing hook and rod and went down to the seashore and sat down on the rocks.\n", "He baited his hook and then threw it into the sea clumsily.\n", "He sat and gazed at the little float bobbing up and down in the water , and longed for a good fish to come and be caught.\n", "Every time the buoy moved a little he pulled up his rod , but there was never a fish at the end of it , only the hook and the bait.\n", "If he had known how to fish properly , he would have been able to catch plenty of fish , but although he was the greatest hunter in the land he could not help being the most bungling fisher.\n", "The whole day passed in this way , while he sat on the rocks holding the fishing rod and waiting in vain for his luck to turn.\n", "At last the day began to darken , and the evening came ; still he had caught not a single fish.\n", "Drawing up his line for the last time before going home , he found that he had lost his hook without even knowing when he had dropped it.\n", "He now began to feel extremely anxious , for he knew that his brother would be angry at his having lost his hook , for , it being his only one , he valued it above all other things.\n", "The person_1 now set to work to look among the rocks and on the sand for the lost hook , and while he was searching to and fro , his brother , the Skillful Fisher , arrived on the scene.\n", "He had failed to find any game while hunting that day , and was not only in a bad temper , but looked fearfully cross.\n", "When he saw the person_1 searching about on the shore he knew that something must have gone wrong , so he said at once : `` What are you doing , my brother ?\"\n", "The person_1 went forward timidly , for he feared his brother 's anger , and said : `` Oh , my brother , I have indeed done badly\"\n", "`` What is the matter ? -- what have you done ?\"\n", "asked the elder brother impatiently.\n", "`` I have lost your precious fishing hook --\"\n", "While he was still speaking his brother stopped him , and cried out fiercely : `` Lost my hook ! It is just what I expected.\n", "For this reason , when you first proposed your plan of changing over our occupations I was really against it , but you seemed to wish it so much that I gave in and allowed you to do as you wished.\n", "The mistake of our trying unfamiliar tasks is soon seen ! And you have done badly.\n", "I will not return you your bow and arrow till you have found my hook.\n", "Look to it that you find it and return it to me quickly\"\n", "The person_1 felt that he was to blame for all that had come to pass , and bore his brother 's scornful scolding with humility and patience.\n", "He hunted everywhere for the hook most diligently , but it was nowhere to be found.\n", "He was at last obliged to give up all hope of finding it.\n", "He then went home , and in desperation broke his beloved sword into pieces and made five hundred hooks out of it.\n", "He took these to his angry brother and offered them to him , asking his forgiveness , and begging him to accept them in the place of the one he had lost for him.\n", "It was useless ; his brother would not listen to him , much less grant his request.\n", "The person_1 then made another five hundred hooks , and again took them to his brother , beseeching him to pardon him.\n", "`` Though you make a million hooks ,\"\n", "said the Skillful Fisher , shaking his head , `` they are of no use to me.\n", "I can not forgive you unless you bring me back my own hook\"\n", "Nothing would appease the anger of the Skillful Fisher , for he had a bad disposition , and had always hated his brother because of his virtues , and now with the excuse of the lost fishing hook he planned to kill him and to usurp his place as ruler of Japan.\n", "The person_1 knew all this full well , but he could say nothing , for being the younger he owed his elder brother obedience ; so he returned to the seashore and once more began to look for the missing hook.\n", "He was much cast down , for he had lost all hope of ever finding his brother 's hook now.\n", "While he stood on the beach , lost in perplexity and wondering what he had best do next , an old man suddenly appeared carrying a stick in his hand.\n", "The person_1 afterwards remembered that he did not see from whence the old man came , neither did he know how he was there -- he happened to look up and saw the old man coming towards him.\n", "`` You are Hohodemi , the Augustness , sometimes called the person_1 , are you not ?\"\n", "asked the old man.\n", "`` What are you doing alone in such a place ?\"\n", "`` Yes , I am he ,\"\n", "answered the unhappy young man.\n", "`` Unfortunately , while fishing I lost my brother 's precious fishing hook.\n", "I have hunted this shore all over , but alas !

face was pale , and his eyes were nearly closed and looked but half their usual size.\n", "`` Answer , O TAI !\"\n", "cried the person_5 , `` why did you not come in answer to my summons today ?\"\n", "`` I have been ill since yesterday ,\"\n", "answered the TAI ; `` that is why I could not come\"\n", "`` Do n't say another word !\"\n", "cried out person_0 angrily.\n", "`` Your illness is the punishment of the gods for stealing the Mikoto 's hook\"\n", "`` It is only too true !\"\n", "said the TAI ; `` the hook is still in my throat , and all my efforts to get it out have been useless.\n",

heedlessly snapped at the bait which I saw in the water , and the hook came off and stuck in my throat.\n", "So I hope you will pardon me\"\n", "The cuttlefish now came forward , and said to the person_4 : `` What I said was right.\n", "You see the hook still sticks in the TAI 'S throat.\n", "I hope to be able to pull it out in the presence of the Mikoto , and then we can return it to him safely !\"\n", "`` O please make haste and pull it out !\"\n", "cried the TAI , pitifully , for he felt the pains in his throat coming on again ; `` I do so want to return the hook to the Mikoto\"\n", "`` All right , TAI SAN ,\"\n", "said his friend the cuttlefish , and then opening the TAI 'S mouth as wide as he could and putting one of his feelers down the TAI 'S throat , he quickly and easily drew the hook out of the sufferer 's large mouth.\n", "He then washed it and brought it to the person_4.\n", "person_0 took the hook from his subject , and then respectfully returned it to the person_1 -LRB- the Mikoto or Augustness , the fishes called him -RRB- , who was overjoyed at getting back his hook.\n", "He thanked person_0 many times , his face beaming with gratitude , and said that he owed the happy ending of his quest to the person_5 's wise authority and kindness.\n", "person_0 now desired to punish the TAI , but the person_1 begged him not to do so ; since his lost hook was thus happily recovered he did not wish to make more trouble for the poor TAI.\n", "It was indeed the TAI who had taken the hook , but he had already suffered enough for his fault , if fault it could be called.\n", "What had been done was done in heedlessness and not by intention.\n", "The person_1 said he blamed himself ; if he had understood how to fish properly he would never have lost his hook , and therefore all this trouble had been caused in the first place by his trying to do something which he did not know how to do.\n", "So he begged the person_5 to forgive his subject.\n", "Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge ? person_0 forgave his subject at once at the request of his August guest.\n", "The TAI was so glad that he shook his fins for joy , and he and all the other fish went out from the presence of their person_4 , praising the virtues of the person_1.\n", "Now that the hook was found the person_1 had nothing to keep him in person_0 Gu , and he was anxious to get back to his own kingdom and to make peace with his angry brother , the Skillful Fisher ; but the person_5 , who had learned to love him and would fain have kept him as a son , begged him not to go so soon , but to make the person_5 Palace his home as long as ever he liked.\n", "While the person_1 was still hesitating , the two lovely Princesses , Tayotama and Tamayori , came , and with the sweetest of bows and voices joined with their father in pressing him to stay , so that without seeming ungracious he could not say them `` Nay ,\"\n", "and was obliged to stay on for some time.\n", "Between the person_5 Realm and the Earth there was no difference in the night of time , and the person_1 found that three years went fleeting quickly by in this delightful land.\n", "The years pass swiftly when any one is truly happy.\n", "But though the wonders of that enchanted land seemed to be new every day , and though the person_5 's kindness seemed rather to increase than to grow less with time , the person_1 grew more and more homesick as the days passed , and he could not repress a great anxiety to know what had happened to his home and his country and his brother while he had been away.\n", "So at last he went to the person_5 and said : `` My stay with you here has been most happy and I am very grateful to you for all your kindness to me , but I govern Japan , and , delightful as this place is , I can not absent myself forever from my country.\n", "I must also return the fishing hook to my brother and ask his forgiveness for having deprived him of it for so long.\n", "I am indeed very sorry to part from you , but this time it can not be helped.\n", "With your gracious permission , I will take my leave to-day.\n", "I hope to make you another visit some day.\n", "Please give up the idea of my staying longer now\"\n", "person_4 person_3 was overcome with sorrow at the thought that he must lose his friend who had made a great diversion in the Palace of the person_5 , and his tears fell fast as he answered : `` We are indeed very sorry to part with you , Mikoto , for we have enjoyed your stay with us very much.\n", "You have been a noble and honored guest and we have heartily made you welcome.\n", "I quite understand that as you govern Japan you ought to be there and not here , and that it is vain for us to try and keep you longer with us , much as we would like to have you stay.\n", "I hope you will not forget us.\n", "Strange circumstances have brought us together and I trust the friendship thus begun between the Land and the person_5 will last and grow stronger than it has ever been before\"\n", "When the person_5 had finished speaking he turned to his two daughters and bade them bring him the two Tide-Jewels of the person_5.\n", "The two Princesses bowed low , rose and glided out of the hall.\n", "In a few minutes they returned , each one carrying in her hands a flashing gem which filled the room with light.\n", "As the person_1 looked at them he wondered what they could be.\n", "The person_5 took them from his daughters and said to his guest : `` These two valuable talismans we have inherited from our ancestors from time immemorial.\n", "We now give them to you as a parting gift in token of our great affection for you.\n", "These two gems are called the nanjiu and the kanjiu\"\n", "The person_1 bowed low to the ground and said : `` I can never thank you enough for all your kindness to me.\n", "And now will you add one more favor to the rest and tell me what these jewels are and what I am to do with them ?\"\n", "`` The nanjiu ,\"\n", "answered the person_5 , `` is also called the Jewel of the Flood Tide , and whoever holds it in his possession can command the sea to roll in and to flood the land at any time that he wills.\n", "The kanjiu is also called the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide , and this gem controls the sea and the waves thereof , and will cause even a tidal wave to recede\"\n", "Then person_0 showed his friend how to use the talismans one by one and handed them to him.\n", "The person_1 was very glad to have these two wonderful gems , the Jewel of the Flood Tide and the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide , to take back with him , for he felt that they would preserve him in case of danger from enemies at any time.\n", "After thanking his kind host again and again , he prepared to depart.\n", "The person_5 and the two Princesses , Tayotama and Tamayori , and all the inmates of the Palace , came out to say `` Good-by ,\"\n", "and before the sound

and I would beg of him to permit me to refuse his present , were I not afraid of disobliging him ; do you therefore endeavor to obtain his leave that I may be excused accepting it.\n", "' ` Sir , ' replied person_0 , ` I am not at all surprised that your majesty thinks this present so extraordinary.\n", "I know you are not accustomed upon earth to see precious stones of this quality and quantity : but if you knew , as I do , the mines whence these jewels were taken , and that it is in my power to form a treasure greater than those of all the kings of the earth , you would wonder we should have the boldness to make you a present of so small a value.\n", "I beseech you , therefore , not to regard it in that light , but on account of the sincere friendship which obliges us to offer it to you not to give us the mortification of refusing it.\n", "' This obliged the person_0 of person_2 to accept the present , for which he returned many thanks both to person_0 and the queen his mother.\n", "A few days after , person_0 gave the person_0 of person_2 to understand that the queen his mother , the princesses his relations and himself , could have no greater pleasure than to spend their whole lives at his court ; but that having been so long absent from their own kingdom , where their presence was absolutely necessary , they begged of him not to take it ill if they took leave of him and person_3.\n", "The person_0 of person_2 assured them he was very sorry that it was not in his power to return their visit in their own dominions ; but he added , ` As I am verily persuaded you will not forget person_3 , but come and see her now and then , I hope I shall have the honor to see you again more than once.\n", "' Many tears were shed on both sides upon their separation.\n", "person_0 departed first ; but the queen his mother , and the princesses his relations , were fain to force themselves in a manner from the embraces of person_3 , who could not prevail upon herself to let them go.\n", "This royal company were no sooner out of sight than the person_0 of person_2 said to person_3 , ` Madam , I should have looked with suspicion upon the person that had pretended to pass those off upon me for true wonders , of which I myself have been an eye-witness from the time I have been honored with your illustrious family at my court.\n", "But I can not refuse to believe my own eyes ; and shall remember it as long as I live , and never cease to bless Heaven for sending you to me , instead of to any other prince.\n", "'\"\n", "There was once a sultan of India who had three sons.\n", "These , with the princess his niece , were the ornaments of his court.\n", "The eldest of the princes was called person_4 , the second person_3 , the youngest person_2 , and the princess his niece , person_0.\n", "The person_1 was the daughter of the younger brother of the sultan , to whom the sultan in his lifetime allowed a considerable revenue.\n", "But that prince had not been married long before he died , and left the princess very young.\n", "The sultan , out of brotherly love and friendship , took upon himself the care of his niece 's education , and brought her up in his palace with the three princes , where her singular beauty and personal accomplishments , joined to a sprightly disposition and irreproachable conduct , distinguished her among all the princesses of her time.\n", "The sultan , her uncle , proposed to get her married , when she arrived at a proper age , to some neighbouring prince , and was thinking seriously about it , when he perceived that the three princes his sons had all fallen in love with her.\n", "He was very much concerned , owing to the difficulty he foresaw whether the two younger would consent to yield to their elder brother.\n", "He spoke to each of them apart ; and after having remonstrated on the impossibility of one princess being the wife of three persons , and the troubles they would create if they persisted , he did all he could to persuade them to abide by a declaration of the princess in favor of one of them ; or to suffer her to be married to a foreign prince.\n", "But as he found them obstinate , he sent for them all together , and said to them , ` Children , since I have not been able to persuade you no longer to aspire to marry the princess your cousin ; and as I have no inclination to force her to marry any of you , I have thought of a plan which will please you all , and preserve union among you , if you will but follow my advice.\n", "I think it would be best , if every one traveled separately into a different country , so that you might not meet each other : and as you know I delight in every thing that is rare and singular , I promise my niece in marriage to him that shall bring me the most extraordinary curiosity ; and for traveling expenses , I will give each of you a sum befitting your rank and the purchase of the curiosity you search.\n", "' As the three princes were always submissive and obedient to the sultan 's will , and each flattered himself that fortune would favor him , they all consented.\n", "The sultan gave them the money he promised ; and that very day they issued orders in preparation for their travels , and took leave of the sultan , that they might be ready to set out early the next morning.\n", "They all went out at the same gate of the city , each dressed like a merchant , attended by a trusty officer dressed like a slave , all well mounted and equipped.\n", "They went the first day 's journey together ; and slept at the first inn , where the road divided into three different tracks.\n", "At night when they were at supper together , they agreed to travel for a year , and to make that inn their rendezvous ; that the first that came should wait for the rest ; that as they had all three taken leave together of the sultan , they should all return together.\n", "The next morning by break of day , after they had embraced and wished each other good success , they mounted their horses , and each took a different road.\n", "person_5 , the eldest brother , who had heard wonders of the extent , strength , riches , and splendor of the kingdom of Bisnagar , bent his course towards the Indian coast ; and , after three months traveling with different caravans , sometimes over deserts and barren mountains , and sometimes through populous and fertile countries , he arrived at Bisnagar , the capital of the kingdom of that name and the residence of its king.\n", "He lodged at a khan appointed for foreign merchants ; and having learned that there were four principal quarters where merchants of all sorts kept their shops , in the midst of which stood the castle , or rather the king 's palace , as the center of the city , surrounded by three courts , and each gate two leagues distant from the other , he went to one of these quarters the next day.\n", "person_5 could not see this quarter without admiration.\n", "It was large , and divided into several streets , all vaulted and shaded from the sun , and yet very light.\n", "The shops were all of the same size and proportion ; and all that dealt in the same sort of merchandise , as well as the craftsmen , lived in one street.\n", "The multitude of shops stocked with the finest linens from several parts of India , some painted in the brightest colors , with men , landscapes , trees , and flowers ; silks and brocades from Persia , China , and other places ; porcelain from Japan and China , foot carpets of all sizes , -- all this surprised him so much that he knew not how to believe his own eyes ; but when he came to the shops of the goldsmiths and jewellers -LRB- for those two trades were exercised by the same merchants -RRB- , he was dazzled by the lustre of the pearls , diamonds , rubies , emeralds , and other precious stones exposed for sale.\n", "But if he was amazed at seeing so many riches in one place , he was much more surprised when he came to judge of the wealth of the whole kingdom by considering that except the Brahmins and ministers of the idols , who profess a life retired from worldly vanity , there was not an Indian , man or woman , through the extent of that kingdom , who did not wear necklaces , bracelets , and ornaments about their legs and feet , made of pearls and other precious stones.\n", "Another thing person_5 particularly admired was the great number of rose-sellers , who crowded the streets ; for the Indians are such lovers of that flower , that not one will stir without a nosegay in his hand , or a garland on his head ; and the merchants keep them in pots in their shops , so that the air of the whole quarter , however large , is perfectly perfumed.\n", "After person_5 had run through the quarter , street by street , his thoughts fully occupied by the riches he had seen , he was very much tired , and a merchant civilly invited him to sit down in his shop.\n", "He accepted the offer ; but had not been seated long before he saw a crier pass by with a piece of carpet on his arm , about six feet square , and cry it at thirty purses.\n", "The prince called to the crier , and asked to see the carpet , which seemed to him to be valued at an exorbitant price , not only for its size , but the meanness of the stuff.\n", "When he had examined it well , he told the crier that he could not comprehend how so small and poor a piece could be priced so high.\n", "The crier , who took him for a merchant , replied , ` Sir , if this price seems so extravagant to you , your amazement will be greater when I tell you I have orders to raise it to forty purses , and not to part with it for less.\n", "' ` Certainly , ' answered person_5 , ` it must have something very extraordinary about it , which I know nothing of.\n", "' ` You have guessed right , sir , ' replied the crier , ` and will own as much when you come to know that whoever sits on this piece of carpet may be transported in an instant wherever he desires to go without being stopped by any obstacle.\n", "' At this the person_5 of the Indies , considering that the principal motive of his journey was to carry some singular curiosity home to the sultan his father , thought that be could not meet with anything which could give him more satisfaction.\n", "` If the carpet , ' said he to the crier , ` has the virtue you assign it , I shall not think forty purses too much but shall make you a present besides.\n", "' ` Sir , ' replied the crier , ` I have told you the truth ; and it will be an easy matter to convince you of it , as soon as you have made the bargain for forty purses , by experiment.\n", "But as I suppose you have not so much with you , and that I must go with you to the khan where you lodge , with the leave of the master of the shop we will go into his back shop , and I will spread the carpet ; and when we have both sat down , and you have formed the wish to be transported into your room at the khan , if we are not transported thither it shall be no bargain.\n", "As to your present , as I am paid for my trouble by the seller , I shall receive it as a favor , and be very much obliged to you for it.\n", "' The prince accepted the conditions , and concluded the bargain ; and having obtained the master 's leave , they went into his back shop ; they both sat down on the carpet , and as soon as the prince wished to be transported into his room at the khan , he found himself and the crier there , and as he wanted no more convincing proof of the virtue of the carpet , he counted to the crier forty purses of gold , and gave him twenty pieces for himself.\n", "In this manner person_5 became the possessor of the carpet , and was overjoyed that on his arrival at Bisnagar he had found so rare a treasure , which he never doubted would gain him the person_1.\n", "In short he looked upon it as an impossible thing for the princes , his younger brothers , to meet with anything to compare with it.\n", "It was in his power , by sitting on this carpet , to be at the place of rendezvous that very day ; but as he was obliged to wait for his brothers , as they had agreed , and as he was curious to see the King of Bisnagar and his court , and to learn about the laws , customs , and religion of the kingdom , he chose to make a longer abode there.\n", "It was a custom of the King of Bisnagar to give audience to all strange merchants once a week ; and person_5 , who remained incognito , saw him often ; and as he was handsome , clever , and extremely polite , he easily distinguished himself among the merchants , and was preferred before them all by the sultan , who asked him about the Sultan of the Indies , and the government , strength , and riches of his dominions.\n", "The rest of his time the prince spent in seeing what was most remarkable in and about the city ; and among other things he visited a temple , all built of brass.\n", "It was ten cubits square , and fifteen high ; and the greatest ornament to it was an idol of the height of a man , of massy gold : its eyes were two rubies , set so artificially , that it seemed to look at those who looked at it , on whichever side they turned.\n", "Besides this , there was another not less curious , in a village in the midst of a plain of about ten acres , which was a delicious garden full of roses and the choicest flowers , surrounded with a small wall breast high , to keep the cattle out.\n", "In the midst of this plain was raised a terrace , a man 's height , so nicely paved that the whole pavement seemed to be but one single stone.\n", "A temple was erected in the middle of this terrace , with a dome about fifty cubits high , which might be seen for several leagues round.\n", "It was thirty cubits long , and twenty broad , built of red marble , highly polished.\n", "The inside of the dome was adorned with three rows of fine paintings , in good taste : and there was not a place in the whole temple but was embellished with paintings , bas-reliefs , and figures of idols from top to bottom.\n", "Every night and morning there were ceremonies performed in this temple , which were always succeeded by sports , concerts , dancing , singing , and feasts.\n", "The ministers of the temple and the inhabitants of the place had nothing to live on but the offerings of pilgrims , who came in crowds from the most distant parts of the kingdom to perform their vows.\n", "person_5 was also spectator of a solemn feast , which was celebrated every year at the court of Bisnagar , at which all the governors of provinces , commanders of fortified places , all the governors and judges of towns , and the Brahmins most celebrated for their learning , were obliged to be present ; and some lived so far off that they were four months in coming.\n", "This assembly , composed of innumerable multitudes of Indians , met in a plain of vast extent , as far as the eye could reach.\n", "In the center of this plain was a square of great length and breadth , closed on one side by a large scaffolding of nine stories , supported by forty pillars , raised for the king and his court , and those strangers whom he admitted to audience once a week.\n", "Inside , it was adorned and furnished magnificently ; and on the outside were painted fine landscapes , wherein all sorts of beasts , birds , and insects , even flies and gnats , were drawn as naturally as possible.\n", "Other scaffolds of at least four or five stories , and painted almost all alike , formed the other three sides.\n", "On each side of the square , at some little distance from each other , were ranged a thousand elephants , sumptuously harnessed , each having upon his back a square wooden castle , finely gilt , in which were musicians and actors.\n", "The trunks , ears , and bodies of these elephants were painted with cinnabar and other colors , representing grotesque figures.\n", "But what person_5 most of all admired was to see the largest of these elephants stand with his four feet on a post fixed into the earth , two feet high , playing and beating time with his trunk to the music.\n", "Besides this , he admired another elephant as big , standing on a board , which was laid across a strong beam about ten feet high , with a great weight at the other end which balanced him , while he kept time with the music by the motions of his body and trunk.\n", "person_5 might have made a longer stay in the kingdom and court of Bisnagar , where he would have seen other wonders , till the last day of the year , whereon he and his brothers had appointed to meet.\n", "But he was so well satisfied with what he had seen , and his thoughts ran so much upon the person_1 , that he fancied he should be the more easy and happy the nearer he was to her.\n", "After he had paid the master of the khan for his apartment , and told him the hour when he might come for the key , without telling him how he should go , he shut the door , put the key on the outside , and spreading the carpet , he and the officer he had brought with him sat down on it , and , as soon as he had wished , were transported to the inn at which he and his brothers were to meet , where he passed for a merchant till they came.\n", "person_5 , the second brother , traveled into Persia with a caravan , and after four months ' traveling arrived at Schiraz , which was then the capital of the kingdom of Persia , and having on the way made friends with some merchants , passed for a jeweller , and lodged in the same khan with them.\n", "The next morning , while the merchants were opening their bales of merchandise , person_5 took a walk into that quarter of the town where they sold precious stones , gold and silver work , brocades , silks , fine linens , and other choice and valuable merchandise , which was at Schiraz called the bezestein.\n", "It was a spacious and well-built place , arched over , and supported by large pillars ; along the walls , within and without , were shops.\n", "person_5 soon rambled through the bezestein , and with admiration judged of the riches of the place by the prodigious quantities of most precious merchandise there exposed to view.\n", "But among all the criers who passed backwards and forwards with several sorts of things to sell , he was not a little surprised to see one who held in his hand an ivory tube about a foot in length and about an inch thick , and cried it at thirty purses.\n", "At first he thought the crier mad , and to make sure , went to a shop , and said to the merchant , who stood at the door , ` Pray , sir , is not that man mad ? If he is not , I am very much deceived.\n", "' ` Indeed , sir , ' answered the merchant , ` he was in his right senses yesterday , and I can assure you he is one of the ablest criers we have , and the most employed of any when anything valuable is to be sold ; and if he cries the ivory tube at thirty purses , it must be worth as much , or more , for some reason or other which does not appear.\n", "He will come by presently , and we will call him ; in the meantime sit down on my sofa and rest yourself.\n", "' person_5 accepted the merchant 's obliging offer , and presently the crier passed by.\n", "The merchant called him by his name ; and pointing to the prince , said to him , ` Tell that gentleman , who asked me if you were in your right senses , what you mean by crying that ivory tube , which seems not to be worth much , at thirty purses : I should be very much amazed myself , if I did not know you were a sensible man.\n", "' The crier , addressing himself to person_5 , said , ` Sir , you are not the only person that takes me for a madman on account of this tube ; you shall judge yourself whether I am or no , when I have told you its peculiarity.\n", "First , sir , ' pursued the crier , presenting the ivory tube to the prince , ` observe that this tube is furnished with a glass at both ends ; by looking through one of them you see whatever object you wish to behold.\n", "' ` I am , ' said the prince , ` ready to make you all proper reparation for the scandal I have thrown on you , if you will make the truth of what you say appear ' ; and as he had the ivory tube in his hand , he said , ` Show me at which of these ends I must look.\n", "' The crier showed him , and he looked through , wishing at the same time to see the sultan , his father.\n", "He immediately beheld him in perfect health , sitting on his throne , in the midst of his council.\n", "Afterwards , as there was nothing in the world so dear to him , after the sultan , as the person_1 , he wished to see her , and saw her laughing , and in a pleasant humor , with her women about her.\n", "person_5 needed no other proof to persuade him that this tube was the most valuable thing , not only in the city of Schiraz , but in all the world ; and he believed that , if he should neglect it , he would never meet again with such another rarity.\n", "He said to the crier , ` I am very sorry that I should have entertained so bad an opinion of you , but hope to make you amends by buying the tube , so tell me the lowest price the seller has fixed upon it.\n", "Come with me , and I will pay you the money.\n", "' The crier assured him that his last orders were to take no less than forty purses ; and , if he disputed the truth of what he said , he would take him to his employer.\n", "The prince believed him , took him to the khan where he lodged , counted out the money , and received the tube.\n", "person_5 was overjoyed at his bargain ; and persuaded himself that , as his brothers would not be able to meet with anything so rare and marvellous , the person_1 would be his wife.\n", "He thought now of visiting the court of Persia incognito , and seeing whatever was curious in and about Schiraz , till the caravan with which he came returned back to the Indies.\n", "When the caravan was ready to set out , the prince joined them , and arrived without any accident or trouble at the place of rendezvous , where he found person_5 , and both waited for person_5.\n", "person_5 took the road to Samarcand ; and the day after his arrival there went , as his brothers had done , into the bezestein.\n", "He had not walked long before he heard a crier , who had an artificial apple in his hand , cry it at five-and-thirty purses.\n", "He stopped the crier , and said to him , ` Let me see that apple , and tell me what virtue or extraordinary property it has , to be valued at so high a rate.\n", "' ` Sir , ' said the crier , putting it into his hand , ` if you look at the outside of this apple , it is very ordinary ; but if you consider the great use and benefit it is to mankind , you will say it is invaluable.\n", "He who possesses it is master of a great treasure.\n", "It cures all sick persons of the most mortal diseases , fever , pleurisy , plague , or other malignant distempers ; and , if the patient is dying , it will immediately restore him to perfect health ; and this is done after the easiest manner in the world , merely by the patient smelling the apple.\n", "' ` If one may believe you , ' replied person_5 , ` the virtues of this apple are wonderful , and it is indeed valuable : but what ground has a plain man like myself , who may wish to become the purchaser , to be persuaded that there is no deception or exaggeration in the high praise you bestow on it ? ' ` Sir , ' replied the crier , ` the thing is known and averred by the whole city of Samarcand ; but , without going any further , ask all these merchants you see here , and hear what they say ; several of them would not have been alive this day if they had not made use of this excellent remedy.\n", "It is the result of the study and experience of a celebrated philosopher of this city , who applied himself all his life to the knowledge of plants and minerals , and at last performed such surprising cures in this city as will never be forgotten ; but he died suddenly himself , before he could apply his own sovereign remedy , and left his wife and a great many young children behind him in very indifferent circumstances ; to support her family , and provide for her children , she has resolved to sell it.\n", "' While the crier was telling person_5 the virtues of the artificial apple , a great many persons came about them , and confirmed what he said ; and one among the rest said he had a friend dangerously ill , whose life was despaired of , which was a favourable opportunity to show person_5 the experiment.\n", "Upon which person_5 told the crier he would give him forty purses if he cured the sick person by letting him smell at it.\n", "The crier , who had orders to sell it at that price , said to person_5 , ` Come , sir , let us go and make the experiment , and the apple shall be yours ; it is an undoubted fact that it will always have the same effect as it already has had in recovering from death many sick persons whose life was despaired of.\n", "' The experiment succeeded , and the prince , after he had counted out to the crier forty purses , and the other had delivered the apple to him , waited with the greatest impatience for the first caravan that should return to the Indies.\n", "In the meantime he saw all that was curious in and about Samarcand , especially the valley of Sogda , so called from the river which waters it , and is reckoned by the Arabians to be one of the four paradises of this world , for the beauty of its fields and gardens and fine palaces , and for its fertility in fruit of all sorts , and all the other pleasures enjoyed there in the fine season.\n", "At last person_5 joined the first caravan that returned to the Indies , and arrived in perfect health at the inn where the person_5s person_4 and person_3 were waiting for him.\n", "person_5 , who was there some time before person_5 , asked person_5 , who got there first , how long he had been there ; he told him three months : to which he replied , ` Then certainly you have not been very far.\n", "' ` I will tell you nothing now , ' said person_5 , ` but only assure you I was more than three months traveling to the place I went to.\n", "' ` But then , ' replied person_5 , ` you made a short stay there.\n", "' ` Indeed , brother , ' said person_5 , ` you are mistaken : I resided at one place over four or five months , and might have stayed longer.\n", "' ` Unless you flew back , ' replied person_5 again , ` I can not comprehend how you can have been three months here , as you would make me believe.\n", "' ` I tell you the truth , ' added person_5 , ` and it is a riddle which I shall not explain till our brother person_2 comes ; then I will let you know what curiosity I have brought home from my travels.\n", "I know not what you have got , but believe it to be some trifle , because I do not see that your baggage is increased.\n", "' ` And pray what have you brought ?

she then rose up in the bed , and asked to be dressed , just as if she had awaked out of a sound sleep.\n", "Her women informed her , in a manner that showed their joy , that she was obliged to the three princes her cousins , and particularly to person_5 , for the sudden recovery of her health.\n", "She immediately expressed her joy to see them , and thanked them all together , and afterwards person_5 in particular , and they then retired.\n", "While the princess was dressing , the princes went to throw themselves at the sultan their father 's feet , and pay their respects to him.\n", "The sultan received and embraced them with the greatest joy , both for their return and for the wonderful recovery of the princess his niece , whom he loved as if she had been his own daughter , and who had been given over by the physicians.\n", "After the usual compliments , the princes presented each the curiosity which he had brought : person_5 his carpet , which he had taken care not to leave behind him in the princess 's chamber ; person_5 his ivory tube , and person_5 the artificial apple ; and after each had commended his present , when they put it into the sultan 's hands , they begged him to pronounce their fate , and declare to which of them he would give the person_1 for a wife , according to his promise.\n", "The Sultan of the Indies having kindly heard all that the princes had to say , without interrupting them , and being well informed of what had happened in relation to the person_1 's cure , remained some time silent , as if he were thinking what answer he should make.\n", "At last he broke silence , and said to them in terms full of wisdom , ` I would declare for one of you , my children , with a great deal of pleasure , if I could do so with justice ; but consider whether I can.\n", "It is true , person_5 , the princess my niece is obliged to your artificial apple for her cure , but let me ask you , whether you could have been so serviceable to her if you had not known by person_5 's tube the danger she was in , and if person_5 's carpet had not brought you to her so soon ? ` Your tube , person_5 , informed you and your brothers that you were likely to lose the princess your cousin , and so far she is greatly obliged to you.\n", "You must also grant that that knowledge would have been of no service without the artificial apple and the carpet.\n", "` And for you , person_5 , consider that it would have been of little use if you had not been acquainted with the princess 's illness by person_5 's tube , and person_5 had not applied his artificial apple.\n", "Therefore , as neither the carpet , the ivory tube , nor the artificial apple has the least preference one over the other , but , on the contrary , there is a perfect equality , I can not grant the princess to any one of you , and the only fruit you have reaped from your travels is the glory of having equally contributed to restore her to health.\n", "` If this be true , ' added the sultan , ` you see that I must have recourse to other means to determine with certainty in the choice I ought to make among you , and as there is time enough between this and night , I will do it to-day.\n", "Go , and get each of you a bow and arrow , and repair to the great plain outside the city , where the horses are exercised.\n", "I will soon come to you , and I declare I will give the person_1 to him that shoots the farthest.\n", "` I do not , however , forget to thank you all in general , and each in particular , for the presents you brought me.\n", "I have a great many rarities in my museum already , but nothing that comes up to the carpet , the ivory tube , and the artificial apple , which shall have the first place among them , and shall be preserved carefully , not only for show , but to make an advantageous use of them upon all occasions.\n", "' The three princes had nothing to say against the decision of the sultan.\n", "When they were out of his presence , they each provided themselves with a bow and arrow , which they delivered to one of their officers , and went to the plain appointed , followed by a great concourse of people.\n", "The sultan did not make them wait long ; and as soon as he arrived , person_5 , as the eldest , took his bow and arrow , and shot first.\n", "person_5 shot next , and much beyond him ; and person_5 last of all ; but it so happened , that nobody could see where his arrow fell ; and , notwithstanding all the search of himself and everybody else , it was not to be found far or near.\n", "And though it was believed that he shot the farthest , and that he therefore deserved the person_1 , it was necessary that his arrow should be found , to make the matter evident and certain ; so , notwithstanding his remonstrances , the sultan determined in favor of person_5 , and gave orders for preparations to be made for the wedding , which was celebrated a few days afterwards with great magnificence\"\n", "There were once upon a time two brothers , one rich and the other poor.\n", "The rich one was a goldsmith and evil-hearted.\n", "The poor one supported himself by making brooms , and was good and honorable.\n", "The poor one had two children , who were twin brothers and as like each other as two drops of water.\n", "The two boys went backwards and forwards to the rich house , and often got some of the scraps to eat.\n", "It happened once when the poor man was going into the forest to fetch brush-wood , that he saw a bird which was quite golden and more beautiful than any he had ever chanced to meet with.\n", "He picked up a small stone , threw it at him , and was lucky enough to hit him , but one golden feather only fell down , and the bird flew away.\n", "The man took the feather and carried it to his brother , who looked at it and said , `` It is pure gold !\"\n", "and gave him a great deal of money for it.\n", "Next day the man climbed into a birch-tree , and was about to cut off a couple of branches when the same bird flew out , and when the man searched he found a nest , and an egg lay inside it , which was of gold.\n", "He took the egg home with him , and carried it to his brother , who again said , `` It is pure gold ,\"\n", "and gave him what it was worth.\n", "At last the goldsmith said , `` I should indeed like to have the bird itself\"\n", "The poor man went into the forest for the third time , and again saw the golden bird sitting on the tree , so he took a stone and brought it down and carried it to his brother , who gave him a great heap of gold for it.\n", "`` Now I can get on ,\"\n", "thought he , and went contentedly home.\n", "The goldsmith was crafty and cunning , and knew very well what kind of a bird it was.\n", "He called his wife and said , `` Roast me the gold bird , and take care that none of it is lost.\n", "I have a fancy to eat it all myself\"\n", "The bird , however , was no common one , but of so wondrous a kind that whosoever ate its heart and liver found every morning a piece of gold beneath his pillow.\n", "The woman made the bird ready , put it on the spit , and let it roast.\n", "Now it happened that while it was at the fire , and the woman was forced to go out of the kitchen on account of some other work , the two children of the poor broom-maker ran in , stood by the spit and turned it round once or twice.\n", "And as at that very moment two little bits of the bird fell down into the dripping-tin , one of the boys said , `` We will eat these two little bits ; I am so hungry , and no one will ever miss them\"\n", "Then the two ate the pieces , but the woman came into the kitchen and saw that they were eating something and said , `` What have ye been eating ?\"\n", "`` Two little morsels which fell out of the bird ,\"\n", "answered they.\n", "`` That must have been the heart and the liver ,\"\n", "said the woman , quite frightened , and in order that her husband might not miss them and be angry , she quickly killed a young cock , took out his heart and liver , and put them beside the golden bird.\n", "When it was ready , she carried it to the goldsmith , who consumed it all alone , and left none of it.\n", "Next morning , however , when he felt beneath his pillow , and expected to bring out the piece of gold , no more gold pieces were there than there had always been.\n", "The two children did not know what a piece of good-fortune had fallen to their lot.\n", "Next morning when they arose , something fell rattling to the ground , and when they picked it up there were two gold pieces ! They took them to their father , who was astonished and said , `` How can that have happened ?\"\n", "When next morning they again found two , and so on daily , he went to his brother and told him the strange story.\n", "The goldsmith at once knew how it had come to pass , and that the children had eaten the heart and liver of the golden bird , and in order to revenge himself , and because he was envious and hard-hearted , he said to the father , `` Thy children are in league with the Evil One , do not take the gold , and do not suffer them to stay any longer in thy house , for he has them in his power , and may ruin thee likewise\"\n", "The father feared the Evil One , and painful as it was to him , he nevertheless led the twins forth into the forest , and with a sad heart left them there.\n", "And now the two children ran about the forest , and sought the way home again , but could not find it , and only lost themselves more and more.\n", "At length they met with a huntsman , who asked , `` To whom do you children belong ?\"\n", "`` We are the poor broom-maker 's boys ,\"\n", "they replied , and they told him that their father would not keep them any longer in the house because a piece of gold lay every morning under their pillows.\n", "`` Come ,\"\n", "said the huntsman , `` that is nothing so very bad , if at the same time you keep honest , and are not idle\"\n", "As the good man liked the children , and had none of his own , he took them home with him and said , `` I will be your father , and bring you up till you are big\"\n", "They learned huntsmanship from him , and the piece of gold which each of them found when he awoke , was kept for them by him in case they should need it in the future.\n", "When they were grown up , their foster-father one day took them into the forest with him , and said , `` To-day shall you make your trial shot , so that I may release you from your apprenticeship , and make you huntsmen\"\n", "They went with him to lie in wait and stayed there a long time , but no game appeared.\n", "The huntsman , however , looked above him and saw a covey of wild geese flying in the form of a triangle , and said to one of them , `` Shoot me down one from each corner\"\n", "He did it , and thus accomplished his trial shot.\n", "Soon after another covey came flying by in the form of the figure two , and the huntsman bade the other also bring down one from each corner , and his trial shot was likewise successful.\n", "`` Now ,\"\n", "said the foster-father , `` I pronounce you out of your apprenticeship ; you are skilled huntsmen\"\n", "Thereupon the two brothers went forth together into the forest , and took counsel with each other and planned something.\n", "And in the evening when they had sat down to supper , they said to their foster-father , `` We will not touch food , or take one mouthful , until you have granted us a request\"\n", "Said he , `` What , then , is your request ?\"\n", "They replied , `` We have now finished learning , and we must prove ourselves in the world , so allow us to go away and travel\"\n", "Then spake the old man joyfully , `` You talk like brave huntsmen , that which you desire has been my wish ; go forth , all will go well with you\"\n", "Thereupon they ate and drank joyously together.\n", "When the appointed day came , their foster-father presented each of them with a good gun and a dog , and let each of them take as many of his saved-up gold pieces as he chose.\n", "Then he accompanied them a part of the way , and when taking leave , he gave them a bright knife , and said , `` If ever you separate , stick this knife into a tree at the place where you part , and when one of you goes back , he will will be able to see how his absent brother is faring , for the side of the knife which is turned in the direction by which he went , will rust if he dies , but will remain bright as long as he is alive\"\n", "The two brothers went still farther onwards , and came to a forest which was so large that it was impossible for them to get out of it in one day.\n", "So they passed the night in it , and ate what they had put in their hunting-pouches , but they walked all the second day likewise , and still did not get out.\n", "As they had nothing to eat , one of them said , `` We must shoot something for ourselves or we shall suffer from hunger ,\"\n", "and loaded his gun , and looked about him.\n", "And when an old hare came running up towards them , he laid his gun on his shoulder , but the hare cried , `` Dear huntsman , do but let me live , Two little ones to thee I 'll give ,\"\n", "and sprang instantly into the thicket , and brought two young ones.\n", "But the little creatures played so merrily , and were so pretty , that the huntsmen could not find it in their hearts to kill them.\n", "They therefore kept them with them , and the little hares followed on foot.\n", "Soon after this , a fox crept past ; they were just going to shoot it , but the fox cried , `` Dear hunstman , do but let me live , Two little ones I 'll also give\"\n", "He , too , brought two little foxes , and the huntsmen did not like to kill them either , but gave them to the hares for company , and they followed behind.\n", "It was not long before a wolf strode out of the thicket ;

A lion came , and tossed his mane.\n", "But the huntsmen did not let themselves be frightened and aimed at him likewise , but the lion also said , `` Dear huntsman , do but let me live , Two little ones I , too , will give\"\n", "And he brought his little ones to them , and now the huntsmen had two lions , two bears , two wolves , two foxes , and two hares , who followed them and served them.\n", "In thu meantime their hunger was not appeased by this , and they said to the foxes , `` Hark ye , cunning fellows , provide us with something to eat.\n", "You are crafty and deep\"\n", "They replied , `` Not far from here lies a village , from which we have already brought many a fowl ; we will show you the way there\"\n", "So they went into the village , bought themselves something to eat , had some food given to their beasts , and then traveled onwards.\n", "The foxes , however , knew their way very well about the district and where the poultry-yards were , and were able to guide the huntsmen.\n", "Now they traveled about for a while , but could find no situations where they could remain together , so they said , `` There is nothing else for it , we must part\"\n", "They divided the animals , so that each of them had a lion , a bear , a wolf , a fox , and a hare , then they took leave of each other , promised to love each other like brothers till their death , and stuck the knife which their foster-father had given them , into a tree , after which one went east , and the other went west.\n", "The younger , however , arrived with his beasts in a town which was all hung with black crape.\n", "He went into an inn , and asked the host if he could accommodate his animals.\n", "The innkeeper gave him a stable , where there was a hole in the wall , and the hare crept out and fetched himself the head of a cabbage , and the fox fetched himself a hen , and when he had devoured that got the cock as well , but the wolf , the bear , and the lion could not get out because they were too big.\n", "Then the innkeeper let them be taken to a place where a cow was just then lying on the grass , that they might eat till they were satisfied.\n", "And when the huntsman had taken care of his animals , he asked the innkeeper why the town was thus hung with black crape ?

the person_0 's marshal , however , was to stand still , and see all from a distance.\n", "When the person_0 's daughter got to the top of the hill , it was not the dragon which stood there , but the young huntsman , who comforted her , and said he would save her , led her into the church , and locked her in.\n", "It was not long before the seven-headed dragon came thither with loud roaring.\n", "When he perceived the huntsman , he was astonished and said , `` What business hast thou here on the hill ?\"\n", "The huntsman answered , `` I want to fight with thee\"\n", "Said the dragon , `` Many knights have left their lives here , I shall soon have made an end of thee too ,\"\n", "and he breathed fire out of seven jaws.\n", "The fire was to have lighted the dry grass , and the huntsman was to have been suffocated in the heat and smoke , but the animals came running up and trampled out the fire.\n", "Then the dragon rushed upon the huntsman , but he swung his sword until it sang through the air , and struck off three of his heads.\n", "Then the dragon grew right furious , and rose up in the air , and spat out flames of fire over the huntsman , and was about to plunge down on him , but the huntsman once more drew out his sword , and again cut off three of his heads.\n", "The monster became faint and sank down , nevertheless it was just able to rush upon the huntsman , but he with his last strength smote its tail off , and as he could fight no longer , called up his animals who tore it in pieces.\n", "When the struggle was ended , the huntsman unlocked the church , and found the person_0 's daughter lying on the floor , as she had lost her senses with anguish and terror during the contest.\n", "He carried her out , and when she came to herself once more , and opened her eyes , he showed her the dragon all cut to pieces , and told her that she was now delivered.\n", "She rejoiced and said , `` Now thou wilt be my dearest husband , for my father has promised me to him who kills the dragon\"\n", "Thereupon she took off her necklace of coral , and divided it amongst the animals in order to reward them , and the lion received the golden clasp.\n", "Her pocket-handkerchief , however , on which was her name , she gave to the huntsman , who went and cut the tongues out of the dragon 's seven heads , wrapped them in the handkerchief , and preserved them carefully.\n", "That done , as he was so faint and weary with the fire and the battle , he said to the maiden , `` We are both faint and weary , we will sleep awhile\"\n", "Then she said , `` yes ,\"\n", "and they lay down on the ground , and the huntsman said to the lion , `` Thou shalt keep watch , that no one surprises us in our sleep ,\"\n", "and both fell asleep.\n", "The lion lay down beside them to watch , but he also was so weary with the fight , that he called to the bear and said , `` Lie down near me , I must sleep a little : if anything comes , waken me\"\n", "Then the bear lay down beside him , but he also was tired , and called the wolf and said , `` Lie down by me , I must sleep a little , but if anything comes , waken me\"\n", "Then the wolf lay down by him , but he was tired likewise , and called the fox and said , `` Lie down by me , I must sleep a little ;

chamber with her , and said , `` Dear Wolf , what dost thou want ?\"\n", "He answered , `` My master , who killed the dragon , is here , I am to ask for some vegetables , such as the person_0 eats\"\n", "Then she made the cook come , and he had to make ready a dish of vegetables , such as the person_0 ate , and had to carry it for the wolf as far as the door , and then the wolf took the

bear trotted to the palace , and every one got out of his way , but when he went to the guard , they presented their muskets , and would not let him go into the royal palace.\n", "But he got up on his hind legs , and gave them a few boxes on the ears , right and left , with his paws , so that the whole watch broke up , and then he went straight to the person_0 's daughter , placed himself behind her , and growled a little.\n", "Then she looked behind her , knew the bear , and bade him go into her room with her , and said , `` Dear Bear , what dost thou want ?\"\n", "He answered , `` My master , who killed the dragon , is here , and I am to ask for some confectionery , such as the person_0 eats\"\n", "Then she summoned her confectioner , who had to bake confectionery such as the person_0 ate , and carry it to the door for the bear ; then the bear first licked up the comfits which had rolled down , and then he stood upright , took the dish , and carried it to his master.\n", "`` Behold , sir host ,\"\n", "said the huntsman , `` now I have bread , meat , vegetables and confectionery , but I will drink wine also , and such as the person_0 drinks\"\n", "He called his lion to him and said , `` Dear Lion , thou thyself likest to drink till thou art intoxicated , go and fetch me some wine , such as is drunk by the person_0\"\n", "Then the lion strode through the streets , and the people fled from him , and when he came to the watch , they wanted to bar the way against him , but he did but roar once , and they all ran away.\n", "Then the lion went to the royal apartment , and knocked at the door with his tail.\n", "Then the person_0 's daughter came forth , and was almost afraid of the lion , but she knew him by the golden clasp of her necklace , and bade him go with her into her chamber , and said , `` Dear Lion , what wilt thou have ?\"\n", "He answered , `` My master , who killed the dragon , is here , and I am to ask for some wine such as is drunk by the person_0\"\n", "Then she bade the cup-bearer be called , who was to give the lion some wine like that which was drunk by the person_0.\n", "The lion said , `` I will go with him , and see that I get the right wine\"\n", "Then he went down with the cup-bearer , and when they were below , the cup-bearer wanted to draw him some of the common wine that was drunk by the person_0 's servants , but the lion said , `` Stop , I will taste the wine first ,\"\n", "and he drew half a measure , and swallowed it down at one draught.\n", "`` No ,\"\n", "said he , `` that is not right\"\n", "The cup-bearer looked at him askance , but went on , and was about to give him some out of another barrel which was for the person_0 's marshal.\n", "The lion said , `` Stop , let me taste the wine first ,\"\n", "and drew half a measure and drank it.\n", "`` That is better , but still not right ,\"\n", "said he.\n", "Then the cup-bearer grew angry and said , `` How can a stupid animal like you understand wine ?\"\n", "But the lion gave him a blow behind the ears , which made him fall down by no means gently , and when he had got up again , he conducted the lion quite silently into a little cellar apart , where the person_0 's wine lay , from which no one ever drank.\n", "The lion first drew half a measure and tried the wine , and then he said , That may possibly be the right sort , and bade the cup-bearer fill six bottles of it.\n", "And now they went upstairs again , but when the lion came out of the cellar into the open air , he reeled here and there , and was rather drunk , and the cup-bearer was forced to carry the wine as far as the door for him , and then the lion took the handle of the basket in his mouth , and took it to his master.\n", "The huntsman said , `` Behold , sir host , here have I bread , meat , vegetables , confectionery and wine such as the person_0 has , and now I will dine with my animals ,\"\n", "and he sat down and ate and drank , and gave the hare , the fox , the wolf , the bear , and the lion also to eat and to drink , and was joyful , for he saw that the person_0 's daughter still loved him.\n", "And when he had finished his dinner , he said , `` Sir host , now have I eaten and drunk , as the person_0 eats and drinks , and now I will go to the person_0 's court and marry the person_0 's daughter\"\n", "Said the host , `` How can that be , when she already has a betrothed husband , and when the wedding is to be solemnized to-day ?\"\n", "Then the huntsman drew forth the handkerchief which the person_0 's daughter had given him on the dragon 's hill , and in which were folded the monster 's seven tongues , and said , `` That which I hold in my hand shall help me to do it\"\n", "Then the innkeeper looked at the handkerchief , and said , `` Whatever I believe , I do not believe that , and I am willing to stake my house and courtyard on it\"\n", "The huntsman , however , took a bag with a thousand gold pieces , put it on the table , and said , `` I stake that on it\"\n", "Now the person_0 said to his daughter , at the royal table , `` What did all the wild animals want , which have been coming to thee , and going in and out of my palace ?\"\n", "She replied , `` I may not tell you , but send and have the master of these animals brought , and you will do well\"\n", "The person_0 sent a servant to the inn , and invited the stranger , and the servant came just as the huntsman had laid his wager with the innkeeper.\n", "Then said he , `` Behold , sir host , now the person_0 sends his servant and invites me , but I do not go in this way\"\n", "And he said to the servant , `` I request the Lord person_0 to send me royal clothing , and a carriage with six horses , and servants to attend me\"\n", "When the person_0 heard the answer , he said to his daughter , `` What shall I do ?\"\n", "She said , `` Cause him to be fetched as he desires to be , and you will do well\"\n", "Then the person_0 sent royal apparel , a carriage with six horses , and servants to wait on him.\n", "When the huntsman saw them coming , he said , `` Behold , sir host , now I am fetched as I desired to be ,\"\n", "and he put on the royal garments , took the handkerchief with the dragon 's tongues with him , and drove off to the person_0.\n", "When the person_0 saw him coming , he said to his daughter , `` How shall I receive him ?\"\n", "She answered , `` Go to meet him and you will do well\"\n", "Then the person_0 went to meet him and led him in , and his animals followed.\n", "The person_0 gave him a seat near himself and his daughter , and the marshal , as bridegroom , sat on the other side , but no longer knew the huntsman.\n", "And now at this very moment , the seven heads of the dragon were brought in as a spectacle , and the person_0 said , `` The seven heads were cut off the dragon by the marshal , wherefore to-day I give him my daughter to wife\"\n", "The the huntsman stood up , opened the seven mouths , and said , `` Where are the seven tongues of the dragon ?\"\n", "Then was the marshal terrified , and grew pale and knew not what answer he should make , and at length in his anguish he said , `` Dragons have no tongues\"\n", "The huntsman said , `` Liars ought to have none , but the dragon 's tongues are the tokens of the victor ,\"\n", "and he unfolded the handkerchief , and there lay all seven inside it.\n", "And he put each tongue in the mouth to which it belonged , and it fitted exactly.\n", "Then he took the handkerchief on which the name of the princess was embroidered , and showed it to the maiden , and asked to whom she had given it , and she replied , `` To him who killed the dragon\"\n", "And then he called his animals , and took the collar off each of them and the golden clasp from the lion , and showed them to the maiden and asked to whom they belonged.\n", "She answered , `` The necklace and golden clasp were mine , but I divided them among the animals who helped to conquer the dragon\"\n", "Then spake the huntsman , `` When I , tired with the fight , was resting and sleeping , the marshal came and cut off my head.\n", "Then he carried away the person_0 's daughter , and gave out that it was he who had killed the dragon , but that he lied I prove with the tongues , the handkerchief , and the necklace\"\n", "And then he related how his animals had healed him by means of a wonderful root , and how he had traveled about with them for one year , and had at length again come there and had learned the treachery of the marshal by the inn-keeper 's story.\n", "Then the person_0 asked his daughter , `` Is it true that this man killed the dragon ?\"\n", "And she answered , `` Yes , it is true.\n", "Now can I reveal the wicked deed of the marshal , as it has come to light without my connivance , for he wrung from me a promise to be silent.\n", "For this reason , however , did I make the condition that the marriage should not be solemnized for a year and a day\"\n", "Then the person_0 bade twelve councillors be summoned who were to pronounce judgment on the marshal , and they sentenced him to be torn to pieces by four bulls.\n", "The marshal was therefore executed , but the person_0 gave his daughter to the huntsman , and named him his viceroy over the whole kingdom.\n", "The wedding was celebrated with great joy , and the young person_0 caused his father and his foster-father to be brought , and loaded them with treasures.\n", "Neither did he forget the inn-keeper , but sent for him and said , `` Behold , sir host , I have married the person_0 's daughter , and your house and yard are mine\"\n", "The host said , `` Yes , according to justice it is so\"\n", "But the young person_0 said , `` It shall be done according to mercy ,\"\n", "and told him that he should keep his house and yard , and gave him the thousand pieces of gold as well.\n", "And now the young person_0 and Queen were thoroughly happy , and lived in gladness together.\n", "He often went out hunting because it was a delight to him , and the faithful animals had to accompany him.\n", "In the neighborhood , however , there was a forest of which it was reported that it was haunted , and that whosoever did but enter it did not easily get out again.\n", "The young person_0 , however , had a great inclination to hunt in it , and let the old person_0 have no peace until he allowed him to do so.\n", "So he rode forth with a great following , and when he came to the forest , he saw a snow-white hart and said to his people , `` Wait here until I return , I want to chase that beautiful creature ,\"\n", "and he rode into the forest after it , followed only by his animals.\n", "The attendants halted and waited until evening , but he did not return , so they rode home , and told the young Queen that the young person_0 had followed a white hart into the enchanted forest , and had not come back again.\n", "Then she was in the greatest concern about him.\n", "He , however , had still continued to ride on and on after the beautiful wild animal , and had never been able to overtake it ; when he thought he was near enough to aim , he instantly saw it bound away into the far distance , and at length it vanished altogether.\n", "And now he perceived that he had penetrated deep into the forest , and blew his horn but he received no answer , for his attendants could not hear it.\n", "And as night , too , was falling , he saw that he could not get home that day , so he dismounted from his horse , lighted himself a fire near a tree , and resolved to spend the night by it.\n", "While he was sitting by the fire , and his animals also were lying down beside him , it seemed to him that he heard a human voice.\n", "He looked round , but could perceived nothing.\n", "Soon afterwards , he again heard a groan as if from above , and then he looked up , and saw an old woman sitting in the tree , who wailed unceasingly , `` Oh , oh , oh , how cold I am !\"\n", "Said he , `` Come down , and warm thyself if thou art cold\"\n", "But she said , `` No , thy animals will bite me\"\n", "He answered , `` They will do thee no harm , old mother , do come down\"\n", "She , however , was a witch , and said , `` I will throw down a wand from the tree , and if thou strikest them on the back with it , they will do me no harm\"\n", "Then she threw him a small wand , and he struck them with it , and instantly they lay still and were turned into stone.\n", "And when the witch was safe from the animals , she leapt down and touched him also with a wand , and changed him to stone.\n", "Thereupon she laughed , and dragged him and the animals into a vault , where many more such stones already lay.\n", "As , however , the young person_0 did not come back at all , the Queen 's anguish and care grew constantly greater.\n", "And it so happened that at this very time the other brother who had turned to the east when they separated , came into the kingdom.\n", "He had sought a situation , and had found none , and had then traveled about here and there , and had made his animals dance.\n", "Then it came into his mind that he would just go and look at the knife that they had thrust in the trunk of a tree at their parting , that he might learn how his brother was.\n", "When he got there his brother 's side of the knife was half rusted , and half bright.\n", "Then he was alarmed and thought , `` A great misfortune must have befallen my brother , but perhaps I can still save him , for half the knife is still bright\"\n", "He and his animals traveled towards the west , and when he entered the gate of the town , the guard came to meet him , and asked if he was to announce him to his consort the young Queen , who had for a couple of days been in the greatest sorrow about his staying away , and was afraid he had been killed in the enchanted forest ? The sentries , indeed , thought no otherwise than that he was the young person_0 himself , for he looked so like him , and had wild animals running behind him.\n", "Then he saw that they were speaking of his brother , and thought , `` It will be better if I pass myself off for him , and then I can rescue him more easily\"\n", "So he allowed himself to be escorted into the castle by the guard , and was received with the greatest joy.\n", "The young Queen indeed thought that he was her husband , and asked him why he had stayed away so long.\n", "He answered , `` I had lost myself in a forest , and could not find my way out again any sooner\"\n", "At night he was taken to the royal bed , but he laid a two-edged sword between him and the young Queen ; she did not know what that could mean , but did not venture to ask.\n", "He remained in the palace a couple of days , and in the meantime inquired into everything which related to the enchanted forest , and at last he said , `` I must hunt there once more\"\n", "The person_0 and the young Queen wanted to persuade him not to do it , but he stood out against them , and went forth with a larger following.\n", "When he had got into the forest , it fared with him as with his brother ; he saw a white hart and said to his people , `` Stay here , and wait until I return , I want to chase the lovely wild beast ,\"\n", "and then he rode into the forest and his animals ran after him.\n", "But he could not overtake the hart , and got so deep into the forest that he was forced to pass the night there.\n", "And when he had lighted a fire , he heard some one wailing above him , `` Oh , oh , oh , how cold I am !\"\n", "Then he looked up , and the self-same witch was sitting in the tree.\n", "Said he , `` If thou art cold , come down , little old mother , and warm thyself\"\n", "She answered , `` No , thy animals will bite me\"\n", "But he said , `` They will not hurt thee\"\n", "Then she cried , `` I will throw down a wand to thee , and if thou smitest them with it they will do me no harm\"\n", "When the huntsman heard that , he had no confidence in the old woman , and said , `` I will not strike my animals.\n", "Come down , or I will fetch thee\"\n", "Then she cried , `` What dost thou want ? Thou shalt not touch me\"\n", "But he replied , `` If thou dost not come , I will shoot thee\"\n", "Said she , `` Shoot away , I do not fear thy bullets !\"\n", "Then he aimed , and fired at her , but the witch was proof against all leaden bullets , and laughed , and yelled and cried , `` Thou shalt not hit me\"\n", "The huntsman knew what to do , tore three silver buttons off his coat , and loaded his gun with them , for against them her arts were useless , and when he fired she fell down at once with a scream.\n", "Then he set his foot on her and said , Old witch , if thou dost not instantly confess where my brother is , I will seize thee with both my hands and throw thee into the fire.\n", "She was in a great fright , begged for mercy and said , He and his animals lie in a vault , turned to stone.\n", "Then he compelled her to go thither with him , threatened her , and said , Old sea-cat , now shalt thou make my brother and all the human beings lying here , alive again , or thou shalt go into the fire ! She took a wand and touched the stones , and then his brother with his animals came to life again , and many others , merchants , artizans , and shepherds , arose , thanked him for their deliverance , and went to their homes.\n", "But when the twin brothers saw each other again , they kissed each other and rejoiced with all their hearts.\n", "Then they seized the witch , bound her and laid her on the fire , and when she was burnt the forest opened of its own accord , and was light and clear , and the person_0 's palace could be seen at about the distance of a three hours walk.\n", "Thereupon the two brothers went home together , and on the way told each other their histories.\n", "And when the youngest said that he was ruler of the whole country in the person_0 's stead , the other observed , `` That I remarked very well , for when I came to the town , and was taken for thee , all royal honors were paid me ; the young Queen looked on me as her husband , and I had to eat at her side , and sleep in thy bed\"\n", "When the other heard that , he became so jealous and angry that he drew his sword , and struck off his brother 's head.\n", "But when he saw him lying there dead , and saw his red blood flowing , he repented most violently : `` My brother delivered me ,\"\n", "cried he , `` and I have killed him for it ,\"\n", "and he bewailed him aloud.\n", "Then his hare came and offered to go and bring some of the root of life , and bounded away and brought it while yet there was time , and the dead man was brought to life again , and knew nothing about the wound.\n", "After this they journeyed onwards , and the youngest said , `` Thou lookest like me , hast royal apparel on as I have , and the animals follow thee as they do me ; we will go in by opposite gates , and arrive at the same time from the two sides in the aged person_0 's presence\"\n", "So they separated , and at the same time came the watchmen from the one door and from the other , and announced that the young person_0 and the animals had returned from the chase.\n", "The person_0 said , `` It is not possible , the gates lie quite a mile apart\"\n", "In the meantime , however , the two brothers entered the courtyard of the palace from opposite sides , and both mounted the steps.\n", "Then the person_0 said to the daughter , `` Say which is thy husband.\n", "Each of them looks exactly like the other , I can not tell\"\n", "Then she was in great distress , and could not tell ; but at last she remembered the necklace which she had given to the animals , and she sought for and found her little golden clasp on the lion , and she cried in her delight , `` He who is followed by this lion is my true husband\"\n", "Then the young person_0 laughed and said , `` Yes , he is the right one ,\"\n", "and they sat down together to table , and ate and drank , and were merry.\n", "At night when the young person_0 went to bed , his wife said , `` Why hast thou for these last nights always laid a two-edged sword in our bed ? I thought thou hadst a wish to kill me\"\n", "Then he knew how true his brother had been\"\n", "Long years ago in old Japan there lived in the Province of Echigo , a very remote part of Japan even in these days , a man and his wife.\n", "When this story begins they had been married for some years and were blessed with one little daughter.\n", "She was the joy and pride of both their lives , and in her they stored an endless source of happiness for their old age.\n", "What golden letter days in their memory were these that had marked her growing up from babyhood ; the visit to the temple when she was just thirty days old , her proud mother carrying her , robed in ceremonial kimono , to be put under the patronage of the family 's household god ; then her first dolls festival , when her parents gave her a set of dolls ' and their miniature belongings , to be added to as year succeeded year ; and perhaps the most important occasion of all , on her third birthday , when her first OBI -LRB- broad brocade sash -RRB- of scarlet and gold was tied round her small waist , a sign that she had crossed the threshold of girlhood and left infancy behind.\n", "Now that she was seven years of age , and had learned to talk and to wait upon her parents in those several little ways so dear to the hearts of fond parents , their cup of happiness seemed full.\n", "There could not be found in the whole of the Island Empire a happier little family.\n", "One day there was much excitement in the home , for the father had been suddenly summoned to the capital on business.\n", "In these days of railways and jinrickshas and other rapid modes of traveling , it is difficult to realize what such a journey as that from Matsuyama to Kyoto meant.\n", "The roads were rough and bad , and ordinary people had to walk every step of the way , whether the distance were one hundred or several hundred miles.\n", "Indeed , in those days it was as great an undertaking to go up to the capital as it is for a Japanese to make a voyage to Europe now.\n", "So the wife was very anxious while she helped her husband get ready for the long journey , knowing what an arduous task lay before him.\n", "Vainly she wished that she could accompany him , but the distance was too great for the mother and child to go , and besides that , it was the wife 's duty to take care of the home.\n", "All was ready at last , and the husband stood in the porch with his little family round him.\n", "`` Do not be anxious , I will come back soon ,\"\n", "said the man.\n", "`` While I am away take care of everything , and especially of our little daughter\"\n", "`` Yes.\n", "we shall be all right -- but you -- you must take care of yourself and delay not a day in coming back to us ,\"\n", "said the wife , while the tears fell like rain from her eyes.\n", "The little girl was the only one to smile , for she was ignorant of the sorrow of parting , and did not know that going to the capital was at all different from walking to the next village , which her father did very often.\n", "She ran to his side , and caught hold of his long sleeve to keep him a moment.\n", "`` Father , I will be very good while I am waiting for you to come back , so please bring me a present\"\n", "As the father turned to take a last look at his weeping wife and smiling , eager child , he felt as if some one were pulling him back by the hair , so hard was it for him to leave them behind , for they had never been separated before.\n", "But he knew that he must go , for the call was imperative.\n", "With a great effort he ceased to think , and resolutely turning away he went quickly down the little garden and out through the gate.\n", "His wife , catching up the child in her arms , ran as far as the gate , and watched him as he went down the road between the pines till he was lost in the haze of the distance and all she could see was his quaint peaked hat , and at last that vanished too.\n", "`` Now father has gone , you and I must take care of everything till he comes back ,\"\n", "said the mother , as she made her way back to the house.\n", "`` Yes , I will be very good ,\"\n", "said the child , nodding her head , `` and when father comes home please tell him how good I have been , and then perhaps he will give me a present\"\n", "`` Father is sure to bring you something that you want very much.\n", "I know , for I asked him to bring you a doll.\n", "You must think of father every day , and pray for a safe journey till he comes back\"\n", "`` O , yes , when he comes home again how happy I shall be ,\"\n", "said the child , clapping her hands , and her face growing bright with joy at the glad thought.\n", "It seemed to the mother as she looked at the child 's face that her love for her grew deeper and deeper.\n", "Then she set to work to make the winter clothes for the three of them.\n", "She set up her simple wooden spinning-wheel and spun the thread before she began to weave the stuffs.\n", "In the intervals of her work she directed the little girl 's games and taught her to read the old stories of her country.\n", "Thus did the wife find consolation in work during the lonely days of her husband 's absence.\n", "While the time was thus slipping quickly by in the quiet home , the husband finished his business and returned.\n", "It would have been difficult for any one who did not know the man well to recognize him.\n", "He had traveled day after day , exposed to all weathers , for about a month altogether , and was sunburnt to bronze , but his fond wife and child knew him at a glance , and flew to meet him from either side , each catching hold of one of his sleeves in their eager greeting.\n", "Both the man and his wife rejoiced to find each other well.\n", "It seemed a very long time to all till -- the mother and child helping -- his straw sandals were untied , his large umbrella hat taken off , and he was again in their midst in the old familiar sitting-room that had been so empty while he was away.\n", "As soon as they had sat down on the white mats , the father opened a bamboo basket that he had brought in with him , and took out a beautiful doll and a lacquer box full of cakes.\n", "`` Here ,\"\n", "he said to the little girl , `` is a present for you.\n", "It is a prize for taking care of mother and the house so well while I was away\"\n", "`` Thank you ,\"\n", "said the child , as she bowed her head to the ground , and then put out her hand just like a little maple leaf with its eager wide-spread fingers to take the doll and the box , both of which , coming from the capital , were prettier than anything she had ever seen.\n", "No words can tell how delighted the little girl was -- her face seemed as if it would melt with joy , and she had no eyes and no thought for anything else.\n", "Again the husband dived into the basket , and brought out this time a square wooden box , carefully tied up with red and white string , and handing it to his wife , said : `` And this is for you\"\n", "The wife took the box , and opening it carefully took out a metal disk with a handle attached.\n", "One side was bright and shining like a crystal , and the other was covered with raised figures of pine-trees and storks , which had been carved out of its smooth surface in lifelike reality.\n", "Never had she seen such a thing in her life , for she had been born and bred in the rural province of Echigo.\n", "She gazed into the shining disk , and looking up with surprise and wonder pictured on her face , she said : `` I see somebody looking

so finding that he did not press me as before , I threw him upon the ground , where he lay without motion , and then I took up a great stone , with which I crushed his head to pieces.\n", "I was extremely rejoiced to be freed thus for ever from this cursed old fellow , and walked along the shore of the sea , where I met the crew of a ship that had cast anchor to take in water to refresh themselves.\n", "They were extremely surprised to see me , and to hear the particulars of my adventures.\n", "` You fell , ' said they , ` into the hands of the old man of the sea , and are the first that has ever escaped strangling by him.\n", "He never left those he had once made himself master of till he destroyed them , and he has made this island famous for the number of men he has slain ; so that the merchants and mariners who landed upon it dared not advance into the island but in numbers together.\n", "' After having informed me of these things they carried me with them to the ship ; the captain received me with great satisfaction when they told him what had befallen me.\n", "He put out again to sea , and after some days ' sail we arrived at the harbor of a great city , where the houses were built of good stone.\n", "One of the merchants of the ship , who had taken me into his friendship , asked me to go along with him , and took me to a place appointed as a retreat for foreign merchants.\n", "He gave me a great bag , and having recommended me to some people of the town , who were used to gather cocoa-nuts , he desired them to take me with them to do the like : ` Go , ' said he , ` follow them , and do as you see them do , and do not separate from them , otherwise you endanger your life.\n", "' Having thus spoken , he gave me provisions for the journey , and I went with them.\n", "We came to a great forest of trees , extremely straight and tall , their trunks so smooth that it was not possible for any man to climb up to the branches that bore the fruit.\n", "All the trees were cocoa-nut trees , and when we entered the forest we saw a great number of apes of all sizes , that fled as soon as they perceived us , and climbed up to the top of the trees with surprising swiftness.\n", "The merchants with whom I was gathered stones , and threw them at the apes on the top of the trees.\n", "I did the same , and the apes , out of revenge , threw cocoa-nuts at us as fast and with such gestures as sufficiently testified their anger and resentment : we gathered up the cocoa-nuts , and from time to time threw stones to provoke the apes ; so that by this stratagem we filled our bags with cocoa - nuts , which it had been impossible for us to do otherwise.\n", "When we had gathered our number , we returned to the city , where the merchant who sent me to the forest gave me the value of the cocoa - nuts I had brought ; ` Go on , ' said he , ` and do the like every day , until you have money enough to carry you home.\n", "' I thanked him for his good advice , and gathered together as many cocoa-nuts as amounted to a considerable sum.\n", "The vessel in which I came sailed with merchants who loaded her with cocoa-nuts.\n", "I expected the arrival of another , whose merchants landed speedily for the like loading.\n", "I embarked on board the same all the cocoa-nuts that belonged to me , and when she was ready to sail I went and took leave of the merchant who had been so kind to me ; but he could not embark with me because he had not finished his business.\n", "We set sail towards the islands where pepper grows in great plenty.\n", "From thence we went to the Isle of Comari , where the best sort of wood of aloes grows , and whose inhabitants have made it an inviolable law to drink no wine themselves , nor to suffer any kind of improper conduct.\n", "I exchanged my cocoa-nuts in those two islands for pepper and wood of aloes , and went with other merchants pearl - fishing.\n", "I hired divers , who fetched me up those that were very large and pure.\n", "Then I embarked joyfully in a vessel that happily arrived at Balsora ; from thence I returned to Bagdad , where I made vast sums by my pepper , wood of aloes , and pearls.\n", "I gave the tenth of my gains in alms , as I had done upon my return from other voyages , and endeavored to ease myself from my fatigue by diversions of all sorts\"\n", "After being shipwrecked five times , and escaping so many dangers , could I resolve again to try my fortune , and expose myself to new hardships ? I am astonished at it myself when I think of it , and must certainly have been induced to it by my stars.\n", "But be that as it will , after a year 's rest I prepared for a sixth voyage , notwithstanding the entreaties of my kindred and friends , who did all that was possible to prevent me.\n", "Instead of taking my way by the Persian Gulf , I traveled once more through several provinces of Persia and the person_3 , and arrived at a sea-port , where I embarked on board a ship , the captain of which was resolved on a long voyage.\n", "It was very long indeed , but at the same time so unfortunate that the captain and pilot lost their course , and knew not where they were.\n", "They found it at last , but we had no reason to rejoice at it.\n", "We were all seized with extraordinary fear when we saw the captain quit his post , and cry out.\n", "He threw off his turban , pulled his beard , and beat his head like a madman.\n", "We asked him the reason , and he answered that he was in the most dangerous place in all the sea.\n", "` A rapid current carries the ship along with it , ' he said , ` and we shall all of us perish in less than a quarter of an hour.\n", "Pray to person_0 to deliver us from this danger ; we can not escape it if He does not take pity on us.\n", "' At these words he ordered the sails to be changed ; but all the ropes broke and the ship , without its being possible to help it , was carried by the current to the foot of an inaccessible mountain , where she ran ashore , and was broken to pieces , yet so that we saved our lives , our provisions , and the best of our goods.\n", "This being over , the captain said to us , ` person_0 has done what pleased Him ; we may every man dig our grave here , and bid the world adieu , for we are all in so fatal a place that none shipwrecked here have ever returned to their homes again.\n", "' His discourse afflicted us sorely , and we embraced each other with tears in our eyes , bewailing our deplorable lot.\n", "The mountain at the foot of which we were cast was the coast of a very long and large island.\n", "This coast was covered all over with wrecks , and from the vast number of men 's bones we saw everywhere , and which filled us with horror , we concluded that abundance of people had died there.\n", "It is also impossible to tell what a quantity of goods and riches we found cast ashore there.\n", "All these objects served only to augment our grief.\n", "Whereas in all other places rivers run from their channels into the sea , here a great river of fresh water runs out of the sea into a dark cave , whose entrance is very high and large.\n", "What is most remarkable in this place is that the stones of the mountain are of crystal , rubies , or other precious stones.\n", "Here is also a sort of fountain of pitch or bitumen , that runs into the sea , which the fishes swallow , and then vomit up again , turned into ambergris ; and this the waves throw up on the beach in great quantities.\n", "Here also grow trees , most of which are wood of aloes , equal in goodness to those of Comari.\n", "To finish the description of this place , which may well be called a gulf , since nothing ever returns from it -- it is not possible for ships to get away again when once they come near it.\n", "If they are driven thither by a wind from the sea , the wind and the current ruin them ; and if they come into it when a land-wind blows , which might seem to favor their getting out again , the height of the mountain stops the wind , and occasions a calm , so that the force of the current runs them ashore , where they are broken to pieces , as ours was ; and that which completes the misfortune is that there is no possibility to get to the top of the mountain , or to get out any manner of way.\n", "We continued upon the shore , like men out of their senses , and expected death every day.\n", "At first we divided our provisions as equally as we could , and thus everyone lived a longer or shorter time , according to their temperance , and the use they made of their provisions.\n", "Those who died first were interred by the rest ; and , for my part , I paid the last duty to all my companions.\n", "Nor are you to wonder at this ; for besides that I husbanded the provision that fell to my share better than they , I had provision of my own , which I did not share with my comrades ; yet when I buried the last , I had so little remaining that I thought I could not hold out long : so I dug a grave , resolving to lie down in it , because there was none left to inter me.\n", "I must confess to you at the same time that while I was thus employed I could not but reflect upon myself as the cause of my own ruin , and repented that I had ever undertaken this last voyage ; nor did I stop at reflections only , but had well nigh hastened my own death , and began to tear my hands with my teeth.\n", "But it pleased person_0 once more to take compassion on me , and put it in my mind to go to the bank of the river which ran into the great cave ; where , considering the river with great attention , I said to myself , ` This river , which runs thus under ground , must come out somewhere or other.\n", "If I make a raft , and leave myself to the current , it will bring me to some inhabited country , or drown me.\n", "If I be drowned I lose nothing , but only change one kind of death for another ; and if I get out of this fatal place , I shall not only avoid the sad fate of my comrades , but perhaps find some new occasion of enriching myself.\n", "Who knows but fortune waits , upon my getting off this dangerous shelf , to compensate my shipwreck with interest ? ' I immediately went to work on a raft.\n", "I made it of large pieces of timber and cables , for I had choice of them , and tied them together so strongly that I had made a very solid little raft.\n", "When I had finished it I loaded it with some bales of rubies , emeralds , ambergris , rock-crystal , and rich stuffs.\n", "Having balanced all my cargo exactly and fastened it well to the raft , I went on board it with two little oars that I had made , and , leaving it to the course of the river , I resigned myself to the will of person_0.\n", "As soon as I came into the cave I lost all light , and the stream carried me I knew not whither.\n", "Thus I floated for some days in perfect darkness , and once found the arch so low that it well nigh broke my head , which made me very cautious afterwards to avoid the like danger.\n", "All this while I ate nothing but what was just necessary to support nature ; yet , notwithstanding this frugality , all my provisions were spent.\n", "Then a pleasing sleep fell upon me.\n", "I can not tell how long it continued ; but when I awoke , I was surprised to find myself in the middle of a vast country , at the bank of a river , where my raft was tied , amidst a great number of negroes.\n", "I got up as soon as I saw them and saluted them.\n", "They spoke to me , but I did not understand their language.\n", "I was so transported with joy that I knew not whether I was asleep or awake ; but being persuaded that I was not asleep , I recited the following words in Arabic aloud : ` Call upon the Almighty , he will help thee ; thou needest not perplex thyself about anything else ; shut thy eyes , and while thou art asleep , person_0 will change thy bad fortune into good.\n", "' One of the blacks , who understood Arabic , hearing me speak thus , came towards me and said , ` Brother , be not surprised to see us ; we are inhabitants of this country , and came hither to-day to water our fields , by digging little canals from this river , which comes out of the neighbouring mountain.\n", "We saw something floating upon the water , went speedily to find out what it was , and perceiving your raft , one of us swam into the river , and brought it hither , where we fastened it , as you see , until you should awake.\n", "Pray tell us your history , for it must be extraordinary ; how did you venture into this river , and whence did you come ? ' I begged of them first to give me something to eat , and then I would satisfy their curiosity.\n", "They gave me several sorts of food ; and when I had satisfied my hunger , I gave them a true account of all that had befallen me , which they listened to with wonder.\n", "As soon as I had finished my discourse , they told me , by the person who spoke Arabic and interpreted to them what I said , that it was one of the most surprising stories they ever heard , and that I must go along with them , and tell it to their king myself ; the story was too extraordinary to be told by any other than the person to whom it happened.\n", "I told them I was ready to do whatever they pleased.\n", "They immediately sent for a horse , which was brought in a little time ; and having made me get upon him , some of them walked before me to show me the way , and the rest took my raft and cargo , and followed me.\n", "We marched thus altogether , till we came to the city of person_1 , for it was in that island I landed.\n", "The blacks presented me to their king ; I approached his throne , and saluted him as I used to do the kings of the person_3 ; that is to say , I prostrated myself at his feet , and kissed the earth.\n", "The prince ordered me to rise up , received me with an obliging air , and made me come up , and sit down near him.\n", "He first asked me my name , and I answered , ` They call me Sinbad the sailor , because of the many voyages I have undertaken , and I am a citizen of Baghdad.\n", "' ` But , ' replied he , ` how came you into my dominions , and from whence came you last ? ' I concealed nothing from the king ; I told him all that I have now told you , and his majesty was so surprised and charmed with it , that he commanded my adventure to be written in letters of gold , and laid up in the archives of his kingdom.\n", "At last my raft was brought in , and the bales opened in his presence : he admired the quantity of wood of aloes and ambergris ; but , above all , the rubies and emeralds , for he had none in his treasury that came near them.\n", "Observing that he looked on my jewels with pleasure , and viewed the most remarkable among them one after another , I fell prostrate at his feet , and took the liberty to say to him , ` Sir , not only my person is at your majesty 's service , but the cargo of the raft , and I would beg of you to dispose of it as your own.\n", "' He answered me with a smile , ` Sinbad , I will take care not to covet anything of yours , nor to take anything from you that person_0 has given you ; far from lessening your wealth , I design to augment it , and will not let you go out of my dominions without marks of my liberality.\n", "' All the answer I returned was prayers for the prosperity of this prince , and commendations of his generosity and bounty.\n", "He charged one of his officers to take care of me , and ordered people to serve me at his own charge.\n", "The officer was very faithful in the execution of his orders , and caused all the goods to be carried to the lodgings provided for me.\n", "I went every day at a set hour to pay court to the king , and spent the rest of my time in seeing the city , and what was most worthy of notice.\n", "The Isle of person_1 is situated just under the equinoctial line , so that the days and nights there are always of twelve hours each , and the island is eighty parasangs in length , and as many in breadth.\n", "The capital city stands at the end of a fine valley formed by a mountain in the middle of the island , which is the highest in the world.\n", "I made , by way of devotion , a pilgrimage to the place where Adam was confined after his banishment from Paradise , and had the curiosity to go to the top of it.\n", "When I came back to the city , I prayed the king to allow me to return to my country , which he granted me in the most obliging and honorable manner.\n", "He would needs force a rich present upon me , and when I went to take my leave of him , he gave me one much more valuable , and at the same time charged me with a letter for the Commander of the Faithful , our sovereign , saying to me , ` I pray you give this present from me and this letter to Caliph Haroun Alraschid , and assure him of my friendship.\n", "' I took the present and letter in a very respectful manner , and promised his majesty punctually to execute the commission with which he was pleased to honor me.\n", "Before I embarked , this prince sent for the captain and the merchants who were to go with me , and ordered them to treat me with all possible respect.\n", "The letter from the person_2 of person_1 was written on the skin of a certain animal of great value , because of its being so scarce , and of a yellowish color.\n", "The writing was azure , and the contents as follows : -- ` The king of the person_3 , before whom march a hundred elephants , who lives in a palace that shines with a hundred thousand rubies , and who has in his treasury twenty thousand crowns enriched with diamonds , to Caliph Haroun Alraschid : ` Though the present we send you be inconsiderable , receive it as a brother and a friend , in consideration of the hearty friendship which we bear to you , and of which we are willing to give you proof.\n", "We desire the same part in your friendship , considering that we believe it to be our merit , being of the same dignity with yourself.\n", "We conjure you this in the rank of a brother.\n", "Farewell.\n", "' The present consisted first , of one single ruby made into a cup , about half a foot high , an inch thick , and filled with round pearls.\n", "Secondly , the skin of a serpent , whose scales were as large as an ordinary piece of gold , and had the virtue to preserve from sickness those who lay upon it.\n", "Thirdly , fifty thousand drachms of the best wood of aloes , with thirty grains of camphor as big as pistachios.\n", "And fourthly , a she-slave of ravishing beauty , whose apparel was covered all over with jewels.\n", "The ship set sail , and after a very long and successful voyage , we landed at Balsora ;

upon which one of the company answered that we were forbidden to destroy ourselves ; but even if it were lawful , it was more reasonable to think of a way to rid ourselves of the barbarous tyrant who designed so cruel a death for us.\n", "Having thought of a project for that end , I communicated the same to my comrades , who approved it.\n", "` Brethren , ' said I , ` you know there is a great deal of timber floating upon the coast ; if you will be advised by me , let us make several rafts that may carry us , and when they are done , leave them there till we think fit to make use of them.\n", "In the meantime we will execute the design to deliver ourselves from the giant , and if it succeed , we may stay here with patience till some ship pass by to carry us out of this fatal island ;

I will with pleasure do anything to oblige the princess ; go and fetch your daughter , or send for her about midnight , and the gate shall be open to you.\n", "' As soon as night came , the nurse went to look for her son person_6 , and having found him , she dressed him so artificially in women 's clothes that nobody could know he was a man.\n", "She carried him along with her , and the officer verily believing it was her daughter , admitted them together.\n", "The nurse , before she presented person_6 , went to the princess , and said , ` person_7 , this is not a woman I have brought to you ; it is my son person_6 in disguise , newly arrived from his travels , and he having a great desire to kiss your hand , I hope your highness will admit him to that honor.\n", "' ` What ! my brother person_6 , ' said the princess , with great joy : ` come hither , ' cried she , ` and take off that veil ; for it is not unreasonable , surely , that a brother and a sister should see each other without covering their faces.\n", "' person_6 saluted her with profound respect , when she , without giving him time to speak , cried out , ` I am rejoiced to see you returned in good health , after so many years ' absence without sending the least account all the while of your welfare , even to your good mother.\n", "' ` person_7 , ' replied person_6 , ` I am infinitely obliged to your highness for your goodness in rejoicing at my health : I hoped to have heard a better account of yours than what to my great affliction I am now witness of.\n", "Nevertheless , I can not but rejoice that I am come seasonably enough to bring your highness that remedy of which you stand so much in need ; and though I should reap no other fruit of my studies and long voyage , I should think myself fully recompensed.\n", "' Speaking these words , person_6 drew forth out of his pocket a book and other things , which he judged necessary to be used , according to the account he had had from his mother of the princess 's illness.\n", "The princess , seeing him make all these preparations , cried out , ` What ! brother , are you then one of those that believe me mad ? Undeceive yourself and hear me.\n", "' The princess then began to relate to person_6 all the particulars of her story , without omitting the least circumstance , even to the ring which was exchanged for hers , and which she showed him.\n", "After the princess had done speaking , person_6 , filled with wonder and astonishment , continued for some time with his eyes fixed on the ground , without speaking a word ; but at length he lifted up his head and said , ` If it be as your highness says , which I do not in the least doubt , I do not despair of procuring you the satisfaction you desire ; but I must first entreat your highness to arm yourself with patience for some time longer , till I shall return after I have traveled over kingdoms which I have not yet visited ; and when you hear of my return , be assured that the object of your wishes is not far off.\n", "' So saying , person_6 took leave of the princess , and set out next morning on his intended journey.\n", "He traveled from city to city , from province to province , and from island to island , and in every place he passed through he could hear of nothing but the person_5 Badoura -LRB- which was the person_5 of person_2 's name -RRB- , and her history.\n", "About four months afterwards , person_6 arrived at Torf , a seaport town , great and populous , where he no more heard of the person_5 Badoura , but where all the talk was of person_1 , who was ill , and whose history very much resembled hers.\n", "person_6 was extremely delighted to hear this , and informed himself of the place where the prince was to be found.\n", "There were two ways to it ; one by land and sea , the other by sea only , which was the shortest way.\n", "person_6 chose the latter , and embarking on board a merchant ship , he arrived safe in sight of the capital ; but , just before it entered the port , the ship struck against a rock through the unskilfulness of the pilot , and foundered.\n", "It went down in sight of person_1 's castle , where were at that time the king and his grand vizier.\n", "person_6 could swim very well , and immediately on the ship 's sinking cast himself into the sea , and got safe to the shore under the castle , where he was soon relieved by the grand vizier 's order.\n", "After he had changed his clothes and been well treated , and had recovered , he was introduced to the grand vizier , who had sent for him.\n", "person_6 being a young man of good air and address , this minister received him very civilly ; and when he heard him give such just and fitting answers to what was asked of him , conceived a great esteem for him.\n", "He also gradually perceived that he possessed a great deal of knowledge , and therefore said to him , ` From what I can understand , I perceive you are no common man ; you have traveled a great way : would to God you had learned any secret for curing a certain sick person , who has greatly afflicted this court for a long while ! ' person_6 replied that if he knew what malady it was , he might perhaps find a remedy for it.\n", "Then the grand vizier related to him the whole story of person_1 from its origin , and concealed nothing ; his birth , his education , the inclination the king his father had to see him married early , his resistance and extraordinary aversion to marriage , his disobeying his father in full council , his imprisonment , his pretended extravagancies in prison , which were afterwards changed into a violent madness for a certain unknown lady , who , he pretended , had exchanged a ring with him ; though , for his part , he verily believed there was no such person in the world.\n", "person_6 gave great attention to all the grand vizier said ; and was infinitely rejoiced to find that , by means of his shipwreck , he had so fortunately lighted on the person he was looking after.\n", "He saw no reason to doubt that person_1 was the man , and the person_5 of person_2 the lady ; therefore , without explaining himself further to the vizier , he desired to see him , that he might be better able to judge of his illness and its cure.\n", "` Follow me , ' said the grand vizier , ` and you will find the king with him , who has already desired that I should introduce you.\n", "' The first thing that struck person_6 on entering the prince 's chamber was to find him upon his bed languishing , and with his eyes shut.\n", "Although he saw him in that condition , and although the king his father was sitting by him , he could not help crying out , ` Was there ever a greater resemblance ! ' He meant to the person_5 of person_2 ; for it seems the princess and prince were much alike.\n", "The words of person_6 excited the prince 's curiosity so far that he opened his eyes and looked at him.\n", "person_6 , who had a ready wit , laid hold of that opportunity , and made his compliment in verse extempore : but in such a disguised manner , that neither the king nor grand vizier understood anything of the matter.\n", "However , he represented so nicely what had happened to him with the person_5 of person_2 , that the prince had no reason to doubt that he knew her , and could give him tidings of her.\n", "This made him so joyful , that the effects of it showed themselves in his eyes and looks.\n", "After person_6 had finished his compliment in verse which surprised person_1 so agreeably , his highness took the liberty to make a sign to the king his father , to go from the place where he was , and let person_6 sit by him.\n", "The king , overjoyed at this alteration , which gave him hopes of his son 's speedy recovery , quitted his place , and taking person_6 by the hand , led him to it.\n", "Then his majesty demanded of him who he was , and whence he came.\n", "And upon person_6 's answering that he was a subject of person_2 and came from that kingdom , the king cried out , ` Heaven grant that you may be able to cure my son of this profound melancholy , and I shall be eternally obliged to you ; all the world shall see how handsomely I will reward you.\n", "' Having said thus , he left the prince to converse at full liberty with the stranger , whilst he went and rejoiced with the grand vizier.\n", "person_6 leaning down to the prince , spoke low in his ear , thus : ` person_1 , ' said he , ` it is time you should cease to grieve.\n", "The lady for whom you suffer is the person_5 Badoura , daughter of Gaiour , King of person_2.\n", "This I can assure your highness from what she has told me of her adventure , and what I have learned of yours.\n", "She has suffered no less on your account than you have on hers.\n", "' Here he began to relate all that he knew of the princess 's story , from the night of their extraordinary interview.\n", "He omitted not to acquaint him how the king had treated those who had failed in their pretensions to cure the princess of her indisposition.\n", "` But your highness is the only person , ' added he , ` that can cure her effectually , and may present yourself without fear.\n", "However , before you undertake so great a voyage , I would have you perfectly recovered , and then we will take such measures as are necessary.\n", "Think then immediately of the recovery of your health.\n", "' This discourse had a marvellous effect on the prince.\n", "He found such great relief that he felt he had strength to rise , and begged leave of his father to dress himself , with such an air as gave the old king incredible pleasure.\n", "The king could not refrain from embracing person_6 , without inquiring into the means he had used to produce this wonderful effect , and soon after went out of the prince 's chamber with the grand vizier to publish this agreeable news.\n", "He ordered public rejoicings for several days together , and gave great largesses to his officers and the people , alms to the poor , and caused the prisoners to be set at liberty throughout his kingdom.\n", "The joy was soon general in the capital and every corner of his dominions.\n", "person_1 , though extremely weakened by almost continual want of sleep and long abstinence from almost all food , soon recovered his health.\n", "When he found himself in a condition to undertake the voyage , he took person_6 aside , and said , ` Dear person_6 , it is now time to perform the promise you have made me.\n", "I burn with impatience to see the charming princess , and if we do not set out on our journey immediately I shall soon relapse into my former condition.\n", "One thing still troubles me , ' continued he , ` and that is the difficulty I shall meet with in getting leave of my father to go.\n", "This would be a cruel disappointment to me , if you do not contrive a way to prevent it.\n", "You see he scarcely ever leaves me.\n", "' At these words the prince fell to weeping : and person_6 said , ' I foresaw this difficulty ; let not your highness be grieved at that , for I will undertake to prevent it.\n", "person_3 principal design in this voyage was to deliver the person_5 of person_2 from her malady , and this from all the reasons of mutual affection which we have borne to each other from our birth , besides the zeal and affection I otherwise owe her ; and I should be wanting in my duty to her , if I did not do my best endeavor to effect her cure and yours , and exert my utmost skill.\n", "This then is the means I have contrived to obtain your liberty.\n", "You have not stirred abroad for some time , therefore let the king your father understand you have a mind to take the air , and ask his leave to go out on a hunting party for two or three days with me.\n", "No doubt he will grant your request ; when he has done so , order two good horses to be got ready , one to mount , the other to change , and leave the rest to me.\n", "' Next day person_1 Camaralzarnan took his opportunity.\n", "He told the king he was desirous to take the air , and , if he pleased , would go and hunt for two or three days with person_6.\n", "The king gave his consent , but bade him be sure not to stay out above one night , since too much exercise at first might impair his health , and a too long absence create his majesty uneasiness.\n", "He then ordered him to choose the best horses in his stable , and himself took particular care that nothing should be wanting.\n", "When all was ready , his majesty embraced the prince , and having recommended the care of him to person_6 , he let him go.\n", "person_1 and person_6 were soon mounted , when , to amuse the two grooms that led the fresh horses , they made as if they would hunt , and so got as far off the city and out of the road as was possible.\n", "When night began to approach , they alighted at a caravansera or inn , where they supped , and slept till about midnight ;

but his joy will be the greater when he hears you are alive and happy.\n", "' ` Brave person_6 , ' replied the prince , ' I can not but approve such an ingenious stratagem , or sufficiently admire your conduct : I am under fresh obligations to you for it.\n", "' The prince and person_6 , well provided with cash for their expenses , continued their journey both by land and sea , and found no other obstacle but the length of time which it necessarily took up.\n", "They , however , arrived at length at the capital of person_2 , where person_6 , instead of going to his lodgings , carried the prince to a public inn.\n", "They tarried there incognito for three days to rest themselves after the fatigue of the voyage ; during which time person_6 caused an astrologer 's dress to be made for the prince.\n", "The three days being expired , the prince put on his astrologer 's habit ; and person_6 left him to go and acquaint his mother , the person_5 Badoura 's nurse , of his arrival , to the end that she might inform the person_5.\n", "person_1 , instructed by person_6 as to what he was to do , and provided with all he wanted as an astrologer , came next morning to the gate of the king 's palace , before the guards and porters , and cried aloud , ` I am an astrologer , and am come to effect a cure on the estimable person_5 Badoura , daughter of the most high and mighty monarch Gaiour , King of person_2 , on the conditions proposed by his majesty , to marry her if I succeed , or else to lose my life for my fruitless and presumptuous attempt.\n", "' Besides the guards and porters at the gate , this drew together a great number of people about person_1.\n", "No physician , astrologer , nor magician had appeared for a long time , deterred by the many tragic examples of ill success that appeared before their eyes ; it was therefore thought that there were no more men of these professions in the world , or that there were no more so mad as those that had gone before them.\n", "The prince 's good mien , noble air , and blooming youth made everybody that saw him pity him.\n", "` What mean you , sir , ' said some that were nearest to him , ` thus to expose a life of such promising expectation to certain death ? Can not the heads you see on all the gates of this city deter you from such an undertaking ? Consider what you do : abandon this rash attempt , and be gone.\n", "' The prince continued firm , notwithstanding all these remonstrances ; and as he saw nobody come to introduce him , he repeated the same cry with a boldness that made everybody tremble.\n", "Then they all cried , ` Let him alone , he is resolved to die ; God have mercy upon his youth and his soul ! ' He then proceeded to cry out a third time in the same manner , when the grand vizier came in person , and introduced him to the King of person_2.\n", "As soon as the prince came into the king 's presence , he bowed and kissed the ground.\n", "The king , who , of all that had hitherto presumptuously exposed their lives on this occasion , had not seen one worthy to cast his eyes upon , felt real compassion for person_1 on account of the danger he was about to undergo.\n", "But as he thought him more deserving than ordinary , he showed him more honor , and made him come and sit by him.\n", "` Young man , ' said he , ' I can hardly believe that you , at this age , can have acquired experience enough to dare attempt the cure of my daughter.\n", "I wish you may succeed ; and would give her to you in marriage with all my heart , with the greatest joy , more willingly than I should have done to others that have offered themselves before you ; but I must declare to you at the same time , with great concern , that if you do not succeed in your attempt , notwithstanding your noble appearance and your youth you must lose your head.\n", "' ` person_8 , ' replied the prince , ` I am under infinite obligations to your majesty for the honor you design me , and the great goodness you show to a stranger ; but I desire your majesty to believe that I would not have come from so remote a country as I have done , the name of which perhaps may be unknown in your dominions , if I had not been certain of the cure I propose.\n", "What would not the world say of my fickleness , if , after such great fatigues and dangers as I have undergone on this account , I should abandon the enterprise ? Even your majesty would soon lose that esteem you have conceived for me.\n", "If I must die , sir , I shall die with the satisfaction of not having lost your esteem after I have merited it.\n", "I beseech your majesty therefore to keep me no longer impatient to display the certainty of my art.\n", "' Then the king commanded the officer who had the custody of the princess to introduce person_1 into her apartment : but before he would let him go , he reminded him once more that he was at liberty to renounce his design ; yet the prince paid no heed , but , with astonishing resolution and eagerness , followed the officer.\n", "When they came to a long gallery , at the end of which was the princess 's apartment , the prince , who saw himself so near the object of the wishes which had occasioned him so many tears , pushed on , and got before the officer.\n", "The officer , redoubling his pace , with much ado got up with him.\n", "` Whither away so fast ? ' cried he , taking him by the arm ; ` you can not get in without me : and it would seem that you have a great desire for death thus to run to it headlong.\n", "Not one of all those many astrologers and magicians I have introduced before made such haste as yourself to a place whither I fear you will come but too soon.\n", "' ` Friend , ' replied the person_1 , looking earnestly at the officer , and continuing his pace , ` this was because none of the astrologers you speak of were so sure of their art as I am of mine : they were certain , indeed , that they would die if they did not succeed , but they had no certainty of their success.\n", "On this account they had reason to tremble on approaching the place whither I go , and where I am sure to find my happiness.\n", "' He had just spoken these words as he was at the door.\n", "The officer opened it , and introduced him into a great hall , whence was an entrance into the princess 's chamber , divided from it only by a piece of tapestry.\n", "person_1 stopt before he entered , speaking softly to the officer for fear of being heard in the princess 's chamber.\n", "` To convince you , ' said he , ` that there is neither presumption , nor whim , nor youthful conceit in my undertaking , I leave it to your own desire whether I should cure the princess in your presence , or where we are , without going any further ? ' The officer was amazed to hear the prince talk to him with such confidence : he left off insulting him , and said seriously , ` It is no matter whether you do it here or there , provided the business is done : cure her how you will , you will get immortal honor by it , not only in this court , but over all the world.\n", "' The prince replied , ` It will be best then to cure her without seeing her , that you may be witness of my skill : notwithstanding my impatience to see a princess of her rank , who is to be my wife , yet , out of respect to you , I will deprive myself of that pleasure for a little while.\n", "' He was furnished with everything suitable for an astrologer to carry about him ;

I wish he may prove neither a liar nor an impostor.\n", "' The person_5 Badoura took the letter , and opened it with a great deal of indifference , but when she saw the ring , she had not patience to read it through ; she rose hastily , broke the chain that held her , ran to the door and opened it.\n", "She knew the prince as soon as she saw him , and he knew her ; they at once embraced each other tenderly , without being able to speak for excess of joy : they looked on one another a long time , wondering how they met again after their first interview.\n", "The princess 's nurse , who ran to the door with her , made them come into her chamber , where the person_5 Badoura gave the prince her ring , saying , ` Take it ;

so that in time he will be ashamed to appear , and will be forced to pass the rest of his life with his fairy , excluded from any connection with this world ; and then your majesty will have nothing to fear , and can not be reproached with so detestable an action as the shedding of a son 's blood , or confining him in a prison for life.\n", "' When the magician had finished her speech , the sultan asked his favorites if they had anything better to propose ;

therefore he was in the greatest embarrassment what answer to make.\n", "At last he replied , ` If , sir , I have concealed from your majesty what happened to me and what course I took after finding my arrow , the reason was that I thought it was of no great importance to you to be informed of them ;

You will see presently that I am in earnest.\n", "Nourgihan ' said she to her treasurer , taking the tent out of person_5 's hands , ` go and set it up , that the prince may judge whether the sultan his father will think it large enough.\n", "' The treasurer immediately went out from the palace , and carried it to such a distance that when she had set it up one end reached to the palace.\n", "The prince , so far from thinking it small , found it large enough to shelter two armies as numerous as that of the sultan his father ;

but you are to observe that it becomes larger or smaller , according to the army it is to cover , without being touched.\n", "' The treasurer took down the tent again , reduced it to its first size , and brought it and put it into the prince 's hands.\n", "He took it , and next day mounted his horse and went with the usual attendants to the sultan his father.\n", "The sultan , who was persuaded that such a tent as he asked for was beyond all possibility , was in great surprise at the prince 's diligence.\n", "He took the tent and admired its smallness.\n", "But when he had set it up in the great plain , and found it large enough to shelter an army twice as large as he could bring into the field , his amazement was so great that he could not recover himself.\n", "As he thought this might be troublesome in use , person_5 told him that its size would always be proportionate to his army.\n", "To outward appearance the sultan expressed great obligation to the prince his son for so noble a present , desiring him to return his thanks to the fairy person_1 ; and to show what a value he set on it , he ordered it to be carefully laid up in his treasury.\n", "But within himself he became more jealous than ever ; considering that by the fairy 's assistance the prince his son might perform things that were infinitely above his own power , notwithstanding his greatness and riches ; and , therefore , more intent upon his ruin , he went to consult the magician again , who advised him to request the prince to bring him some of the water of the fountain of lions.\n", "In the evening , when the sultan was surrounded as usual by all his court , and the prince came to pay his respects among the rest , he said to him : ` Son , I have already expressed how much I am obliged to you for the present of the tent you have procured me , which I look upon as the most valuable thing in my treasury ; but you must do one thing more for me.\n", "I am informed that the fairy your wife makes use of a certain water , called the water of the fountain of lions , which cures all sorts of fevers , even the most dangerous ; and as I am perfectly sure that my health is dear to you , I do not doubt that you will ask her for a bottle of that water for me , and bring it me as a sovereign remedy , which I may make use of when I have occasion.\n", "Do me this service , and complete the duty of a good son towards a tender father.\n", "' person_5 , who had believed that the sultan his father would have been satisfied with so singular and useful a tent as that which he had brought , and that he would not have imposed any new task upon him which might hazard the fairy 's displeasure ; was thunderstruck at this new request , notwithstanding the assurance she had given him of granting him whatever lay in her power.\n", "After a long silence , he said , ` I beg of your majesty to be assured that there is nothing I would not undertake to prolong your life , but I wish it might not be by means of my wife.\n", "For this reason I dare not promise to bring the water.\n", "All I can do is to assure you I will ask her ; but it will be with as great reluctance as when I asked for the tent.\n", "' The next morning person_5 returned to the fairy person_1 , and related to her sincerely and faithfully all that had passed at the sultan his father 's court , from the giving of the tent , which he told her he received with the utmost gratitude , to the new request he had charged him to make , and when he had done , he added : ` but , my princess , I only tell you this as a plain account of what passed between me and my father.\n", "I leave you to your own discretion to gratify or reject this new desire.\n", "It shall be as you please.\n", "' ` No , no , ' replied the fairy person_1 , ` whatever advice the magician can give him -LRB- for I see that he hearkens to her -RRB- , he shall find no fault with you or me.\n", "There is a great deal of wickedness in this demand , as you will understand by what I am going to tell you.\n", "The fountain of lions is situated in the middle of a court of a great castle , the entrance into which is guarded by four fierce lions , two of which sleep while the other two are awake alternately.\n", "But let not that frighten you.\n", "I will give you means to pass by them without any danger.\n", "' The fairy person_1 was at that time hard at work with her needle ;

one you will ride yourself , and the other you will lead , which must be loaded with a sheep cut into four quarters , and killed to-day.\n", "In the third place , you must be provided with a bottle , which I will give you , to bring the water in.\n", "Set out early to-morrow morning , and when you have passed the iron gate , throw before you the ball of thread , which will roll till it comes to the gates of the castle.\n", "When it stops , as the gates will be open , you will see the four lions.\n", "The two that are awake will , by their roaring , wake the other two.\n", "Be not frightened , but throw each of them a quarter of the sheep , and then clap spurs to your horse , and ride to the fountain.\n", "Fill your bottle without alighting , and then return with the same speed.\n", "The lions will be so busy eating that they will let you pass.\n", "' person_5 set out the next morning at the time appointed by the fairy , and followed her directions carefully.\n", "When he arrived at the gates of the castle , he distributed the quarters of the sheep among the four lions , and passing through the midst of them with haste , got to the fountain , filled his bottle , and returned as safe and sound as he went.\n", "When he was a little distance from the castle gates , he turned round ; and perceiving two of the lions coming after him , he drew his sabre , and prepared for defense.\n", "But as he went forward , he saw one of them turned off the road , and showed by his head and tail that he did not come to do him any harm , but only to go before him , and that the other stayed behind to follow.\n", "He therefore put his sword again into its scabbard.\n", "Guarded in this manner he arrived at the capital of the person_0 ;

but at the same time wish you such health that you may never have occasion to make use of it.\n", "' After the prince had finished speaking , the sultan placed him on his right hand , and then said , ` Son , I am very much obliged to you for this valuable present ; also for the great danger you have exposed yourself to upon my account , which I have been informed of by the magician who knows the fountain of lions ; but do me the pleasure , ' continued he , ` to tell me by what incredible power you have been preserved.\n", "' ` Sir , ' replied person_5 , ` I have no share in the compliment your majesty is pleased to make me ; all the honor is due to the fairy my wife ; I merely followed her good advice.\n", "' The sultan showed outwardly all the demonstrations of joy , but secretly became more and more jealous , retired into an inner apartment , and sent for the magician.\n", "After conferring with her , the sultan next day said to the prince , in the midst of all his courtiers , ` Son , I have one thing more to ask of you ; after which , I shall expect nothing more from your obedience , nor your influence with your wife.\n", "This request is , to bring me a man not above a foot and a half high , whose beard is thirty feet long , who carries upon his shoulders a bar of iron of five hundredweight which he uses as a quarterstaff , and who can speak.\n", "' person_5 , who did not believe that there was such a man in the world as his father described , would gladly have excused himself ; but the sultan persisted in his demand , and told him that the fairy could do more incredible things.\n", "Next day the prince returned to the subterranean kingdom of person_1 , to whom he told his father 's new demand , which , he said , he looked upon as more impossible than the first two ; ` for , ' added he , ` I can not imagine that there is or can be such a man in the world : either he has a mind to try whether I am silly enough to go and seek him ; or if there is such a man , he seeks my ruin.\n", "How can he suppose that I should get hold of a man so small , armed as he describes ? What arms could I make use of to reduce him to submission ? ' ` Do not affright yourself , prince , ' replied the fairy ; ` you ran a risk in fetching the water of the fountain of lions for your father ; but there is no danger in finding this man.\n", "It is my brother , Schaibar , who is so far from being like me , though we both had the same father , that he is of so violent a nature that nothing can prevent his giving gory marks of his resentment for a slight offence ; yet , on the other hand , he is so good as to oblige any one in whatever they desire.\n", "He is made exactly as the sultan your father has described him ; and he has no other arms than a bar of iron five hundred pounds in weight , without which he never stirs , and which makes him respected.\n", "I will send for him , and you shall judge of the truth of what I tell you ; and prepare not to be frightened when you see him.\n", "' ` What ! my queen , ' replied person_5 , ` do you say Schaibar is your brother ? Let him be ever so ugly or deformed , I shall love and honor him , and consider him as my nearest relation.\n", "' The fairy ordered a gold chafing-dish to be set with a fire in it under the porch of her palace , with a box of the same metal.\n", "Taking some incense out of this , and throwing it into the fire , there arose a thick cloud of smoke.\n", "Some moments after , the fairy said to person_5 , ` person_5 , here comes my brother ; do you see him ? ' The prince immediately perceived Schaibar , who was but a foot and a half high , coming gravely with his heavy bar on his shoulder ; his beard , thirty feet long , supported itself before him , and a pair of thick moustaches were tucked up to his ears , almost covering his face : his eyes were very small , like a pig 's , and sunk deep in his head , which was of an enormous size , and on which he wore a pointed cap : besides all this , he had a hump behind and before.\n", "If person_5 had not known that Schaibar was person_1 's brother , he would not have been able to look at him without fear ; but knowing beforehand who he was , he waited for him with the fairy , and received him without the least concern.\n", "Schaibar , as he came forward , looked at the prince with an eye that might have chilled his soul in his body , and asked person_1 who that man was.\n", "To which she replied : ` He is my husband , brother ; his name is person_2 ; he is son to the person_3 of the person_0.\n", "The reason why I did not invite you to my wedding was that I was unwilling to divert you from the expedition you were engaged in , and from which I heard with pleasure that you returned victorious ; on his account I have taken the liberty now to send for you.\n", "' At these words , Schaibar , looking at person_5 with a favourable eye , which however diminished neither his fierceness nor his savage look , said , ` Is there anything , sister , in which I can serve him ? he has only to speak.\n", "It is enough for me that he is your husband.\n", "' ` The sultan his father , ' replied person_1 , ` has a curiosity to see you , and I desire he may be your guide to the person_3 's court.\n", "' ` He need but lead the way ; I will follow him , ' replied Schaibar.\n", "` Brother , ' replied person_1 , ` it is too late to go to-day , therefore stay till to-morrow morning ; and in the meantime , as it is desirable that you should know all that has passed between the person_3 of the person_0 and person_5 since our marriage , I will tell you this evening.\n", "' Next morning , after Schaibar had been informed of all that was proper for him to know , he set out with person_5 , who was to present him to the sultan.\n", "When they arrived at the gates of the capital , the people no sooner saw Schaibar than they ran and hid themselves in their shops and houses , and shut their doors ; while others took to their heels , and communicated their fear to all they met , who did not wait to look behind them , but ran too ; insomuch that Schaibar and person_5 , as they went along , found all the streets and squares deserted , till they came to the palace , where the porters , instead of preventing Schaibar from entering , also ran away ; so that the prince and he advanced without any obstacle to the council-hall , where the sultan was seated on his throne giving audience.\n", "Here likewise the officers , at the approach of Schaibar , abandoned their posts.\n", "Schaibar , carrying his head erect , went fiercely up to the throne , without waiting to be introduced by person_5 , and accosted the person_3 of the person_0 in these words : ` You have asked for me , see , here I am : what do you want with me ?

Where was the tanner 's daughter ? Yes , where was the land , and which land might be nearest to her dwelling ? The bottle knew not ; it drove onward and onward , and was at last tired of wandering , because that was not in its way ; but yet it had to travel until at last it came to land -- to a strange land.\n", "It understood not a word of what was spoken here , for this was not the language it had heard spoken before ; and one loses a good deal if one does not understand the language.\n", "The bottle was fished out and examined on all sides.\n", "The leaf of paper within it was discovered , and taken out , and turned over and over , but the people did not understand what was written thereon.\n", "They saw that the bottle must have been thrown overboard , and that something about this was written on the paper , but what were the words ?

It never occurred to the bottle to think how long it would lie there , for it felt comfortable , and accordingly lay there for years.\n", "At last people came down into the cellar to carry off all the bottles , and ours among the rest.\n", "Out in the garden there was a great festival.\n", "Flaming lamps hung like garlands , and paper lanterns shone transparent , like great tulips.\n", "The evening was lovely , the weather still and clear , the stars twinkled ; it was the time of the new moon , but in reality the whole moon could be seen as a bluish gray disc with a golden rim round half its surface , which was a very beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.\n", "The illumination extended even to the most retired of the garden walks ; at least so much of it , that one could find one 's way there.\n", "Among the leaves of the hedges stood bottles , with a light in each ; and among them was also the bottle we know , and which was destined one day to finish its career as a bottle-neck , a bird 's drinking-glass.\n", "Everything here appeared lovely to our bottle , for it was once more in the greenwood , amid joy and feasting , and heard song and music , and the noise and murmur of a crowd , especially in that part of the garden where the lamps blazed and the paper lanterns displayed their many colors.\n", "Thus it stood , in a distant walk certainly , but that made it the more important ; for it bore its light , and was at once ornamental and useful , and that is as it should be : in such an hour one forgets twenty years spent in a loft , and it is right one should do so.\n", "There passed close to it a pair , like the pair who had walked together long ago in the wood , the sailor and the tanner 's daughter ; the bottle seemed to experience all that over again.\n", "In the garden were walking not only the guests , but other people who were allowed to view all the splendor ; and among these latter came an old maid who seemed to stand alone in the world.\n", "She was just thinking , like the bottle , of the greenwood , and of a young betrothed pair -- of a pair which concerned her very nearly , a pair in which she had an interest , and of which she had been a part , in that happiest hour of her life -- the hour one never forgets , if one should become ever so old a maid.\n", "But she did not know our bottle , nor did the bottle recognize the old maid : it is thus we pass each other in the world , meeting again and again , as these two met , now that they were together again in the same town.\n", "From the garden the bottle was dispatched once more to the wine merchant 's , where it was filled with wine , and sold to the aeronaut , who was to make an ascent in his balloon on the following Sunday.\n", "A great crowd had assembled to witness the sight ; military music had been provided , and many other preparations had been made.\n", "The bottle saw everything , from a basket in which it lay next to a live rabbit , which latter was quite bewildered because he knew he was to be taken up into the air , and let down again in a parachute ; but the bottle knew nothing of the `` up\"\n", "or the `` down ;\"\n", "it only saw the balloon swelling up bigger and bigger , and at last , when it could swell no more , beginning to rise , and to grow more and more restless.\n", "The ropes that held it were cut , and the huge machine floated aloft with the aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit , and the music sounded , and all the people cried , `` Hurrah !\"\n", "`` This is a wonderful passage , up into the air !\"\n", "thought the person_0 ; `` this is a new way of sailing ; at any rate , up here we can not strike upon anything\"\n", "Thousands of people gazed up at the balloon , and the old maid looked up at it also ; she stood at the open window of the garret , in which hung the cage with the little chaffinch , who had no water-glass as yet , but was obliged to be content with an old cup.\n", "In the window stood a myrtle in a pot ; and it had been put a little aside that it might not fall out , for the old maid was leaning out of the window to look , and she distinctly saw the aeronaut in the balloon , and how he let down the rabbit in the parachute , and then drank to the health of all the spectators , and at length hurled the bottle high in the air ; she never thought that this was the identical bottle which she had already once seen thrown aloft in honor of her and of her friend on the day of rejoicing in the greenwood , in the time of her youth.\n", "The bottle had no respite for thought ; for it was quite startled at thus suddenly reaching the highest point in its career.\n", "Steeples and roofs lay far , far beneath , and the people looked like mites.\n", "But now it began to descend with a much more rapid fall than that of the rabbit ; the bottle threw somersaults in the air , and felt quite young , and quite free and unfettered ; and yet it was half full of wine , though it did not remain so long.\n", "What a journey ! The sun shone on the bottle , all the people were looking at it , the balloon was already far away , and soon the bottle was far away too ; for it fell upon a roof and broke ; but the pieces had got such an impetus that they could not stop themselves , but went jumping and rolling on till they came down into the courtyard and lay there in smaller pieces yet ; the bottle-neck only managed to keep whole , and that was cut off as clean as if it had been done with a diamond.\n", "`` That would do capitally for a bird-glass ,\"\n", "said the cellarmen ; but they had neither a bird nor a cage ; and to expect them to provide both because they had found a bottle-neck that might be made available for a glass , would have been expecting too much ; but the old maid in the garret , perhaps it might be useful to her ; and now the bottle-neck was taken up to her , and was provided with a cork.\n", "The part that had been uppermost was now turned downwards , as often happens when changes take place ; fresh water was poured into it , and it was fastened to the cage of the little bird , which sung and twittered right merrily.\n", "`` Yes , it 's very well for you to sing ,\"\n", "said the person_0-neck ; and it was considered remarkable for having been in the balloon -- for that was all they knew of its history.\n", "Now it hung there as a bird-glass , and heard the murmuring and noise of the people in the street below , and also the words of the old maid in the room within.\n", "An old friend had just come to visit her , and they talked -- not of the bottle-neck , but about the myrtle in the window.\n", "`` No , you certainly must not spend a dollar for your daughter 's bridal wreath ,\"\n", "said the old maid.\n", "`` You shall have a beautiful little nosegay from me , full of blossoms.\n", "Do you see how splendidly that tree has come on ? yes , that has been raised from a spray of the myrtle you gave me on the day after my betrothal , and from which I was to have made my own wreath when the year was past ; but that day never came ! The eyes closed that were to have been my joy and delight through life.\n", "In the depths of the sea he sleeps sweetly , my dear one ! The myrtle has become an old tree , and I become a yet older woman ; and when it faded at last , I took the last green shoot , and planted it in the ground , and it has become a great tree ; and now at length the myrtle will serve at the wedding -- as a wreath for your daughter\"\n", "There were tears in the eyes of the old maid.\n", "She spoke of the beloved of her youth , of their betrothal in the wood ; many thoughts came to her , but the thought never came , that quite close to her , before the very window , was a remembrance of those times ; the neck of the bottle which had shouted for joy when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day.\n", "But the bottle-neck did not recognize her , for he was not listening to what this old maid said -- and still that was because he was thinking of her\"\n", "ONCE upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt person_0.\n", "She had eight of a family : four little girl pigs , called Cross-patch , Suck-suck , Yock-yock and Spot ; and four little boy pigs , called person_1 , person_2ling person_4 , Chin - chin and Stumpy.\n", "Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.\n", "The eight little pigs had very fine appetites.\n", "`` Yus , yus , yus ! they eat and indeed they DO eat !\"\n", "said Aunt person_0 , looking at her family with pride.\n", "Suddenly there were fearful squeals ; person_1 had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.\n", "Aunt person_0 and I dragged him out by the hind legs.\n", "Chin-chin was already in disgrace ; it was washing day , and he had eaten a piece of soap.\n", "And presently in a basket of clean clothes , we found another dirty little pig.\n", "`` Tchut , tut , tut ! whichever is this ?\"\n", "grunted Aunt person_0.\n", "Now all the pig family are pink , or pink with black spots , but this pig child was smutty black all over ; when it had been popped into a tub , it proved to be Yock-yock.\n", "I went into the garden ; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots.\n", "I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.\n", "Cross-patch tried to bite me.\n", "`` Aunt person_0 , Aunt person_0 ! you are a worthy person , but your family is not well brought up.\n", "Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and person_2ling person_4\"\n", "`` Yus , yus !\"\n", "sighed Aunt person_0.\n", "`` And they drink bucketfuls of milk ; I shall have to get another cow !

spoke to the pot and spoon , also , and the most delicious dishes of food were provided for them.\n", "So he married the princess , and they lived very happily for several years , until one morning the princess , while arranging her toilet , put the loose hairs into a hollow bit of reed and threw them into the river that flowed along under the window.\n", "The reed floated on the water for many miles , and was at last picked up by the prince of that country , who curiously opened it and saw the golden hair.\n", "On finding it the prince rushed off to the palace , locked himself up in his room , and would not leave it.\n", "He had fallen desperately in love with the woman whose hair he had picked up , and refused to eat , or drink , or sleep , or move , till she was brought to him.\n", "The king , his father , was in great distress about the matter , and did not know what to do.\n", "He feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir.\n", "At last he determined to seek the counsel of his aunt , who was an ogress.\n", "The old woman consented to help him , and bade him not to be anxious , as she felt certain that she would succeed in getting the beautiful woman for his son 's wife.\n", "She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing , and buzzing , and buzzing.\n", "Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful princess , to whom she appeared as an old hag , holding in one hand a stick by way of support.\n", "She introduced herself to the beautiful princess and said , `` I am your aunt , whom you have never seen before , because I left the country just after your birth\"\n", "She also embraced and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words.\n", "The beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived.\n", "She returned the ogress 's embrace , and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she could , and treated her with such honor and attention , that the ogress thought to herself , `` I shall soon accomplish my errand\"\n", "When she had been in the house three days , she began to talk of the charmed ring , and advised her to keep it instead of her husband , because the latter was constantly out shooting and on other such-like expeditions , and might lose it.\n", "Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband for the ring , and he readily gave it to her.\n", "The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious thing.\n", "Doubting nothing , the beautiful princess complied , when the ogress seized the ring , and reassuming the form of a bee flew away with it to the palace , where the prince was lying nearly on the point of death.\n", "`` Rise up.\n", "Be glad.\n", "Mourn no more ,\"\n", "she said to him.\n", "`` The woman for whom you yearn will appear at your summons.\n", "See , here is the charm , whereby you may bring her before you\"\n", "The prince was almost mad with joy when he heard these words , and was so desirous of seeing the beautiful princess , that he immediately spoke to the ring , and the house with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace garden.\n", "He at once entered the building , and telling the beautiful princess of his intense love , entreated her to be his wife.\n", "Seeing no escape from the difficulty , she consented on the condition that he would wait one month for her.\n", "Meanwhile the merchant 's son had returned from hunting and was terribly distressed not to find his house and wife.\n", "There was the place only , just as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring which person_0 Indrasha had given him.\n", "He sat down and determined to put an end to himself.\n", "Presently the cat and dog came up.\n", "They had gone away and hidden themselves , when they saw the house and everything disappear.\n", "`` O master !\"\n", "they said , `` stay your hand.\n", "Your trial is great , but it can be remedied.\n", "Give us one month , and we will go and try to recover your wife and house\"\n", "`` Go ,\"\n", "said he , `` and may the great God aid your efforts.\n", "Bring back my wife , and I shall live\"\n", "So the cat and dog started off at a run , and did not stop till they reached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken.\n", "`` We may have some difficulty here ,\"\n", "said the cat.\n", "`` Look , the king has taken our master 's wife and house for himself.\n", "You stay here.\n", "I will go to the house and try to see her\"\n", "So the dog sat down , and the cat climbed up to the window of the room , wherein the beautiful princess was sitting , and entered.\n", "The princess recognized the cat , and informed it of all that had happened to her since she had left them.\n", "`` But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people ?\"\n", "she asked.\n", "`` Yes ,\"\n", "replied the cat , `` if you can tell me where the charmed ring is\"\n", "`` The ring is in the stomach of the ogress ,\"\n", "she said.\n", "`` All right ,\"\n", "said the cat , `` I will recover it.\n", "If we once get it , everything is ours\"\n", "Then the cat descended the wall of the house , and went and laid down by a rat 's hole and pretended she was dead.\n", "Now at that time a great wedding chanced to be going on among the rat community of that place , and all the rats of the neighborhood were assembled in that one particular mine by which the cat had lain down.\n", "The eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married.\n", "The cat got to know of this , and at once conceived the idea of seizing the bridegroom and making him render the necessary help.\n", "Consequently , when the procession poured forth from the hole squealing and jumping in honor of the occasion , it immediately spotted the bridegroom and pounced down on him.\n", "`` Oh ! let me go , let me go ,\"\n", "cried the terrified rat.\n", "`` Oh ! let him go ,\"\n", "squealed all the company.\n", "`` It is his wedding day\"\n", "`` No , no ,\"\n", "replied the cat.\n", "`` Not unless you do some thing for me.\n", "Listen.\n", "The ogress , who lives in that house with the prince and his wife , has swallowed a ring , which I very much want.\n", "If you will procure it for me , I will allow the rat to depart unharmed.\n", "If you do not , then your prince dies under my feet\"\n", "`` Very well , we agree ,\"\n", "said they all.\n", "`` Nay , if we do not get the ring for you , devour us all\"\n", "This was rather a bold offer.\n", "However , they accomplished the thing.\n", "At midnight , when the ogress was sound asleep , one of the rats went to her bedside , climbed up on her face , and inserted its tail into her throat ; whereupon the ogress coughed violently , and the ring came out and rolled on to the floor.\n", "The rat immediately seized the precious thing and ran off with it to its king , who was very glad , and went at once to the cat and released its son.\n", "As soon as the cat received the ring , she started back with the dog to go and tell their master the good tidings.\n", "All seemed safe now.\n", "They had only to give the ring to him , and he would speak to it , and the house and beautiful princess would again be with them , and everything would go on as happily as before.\n", "`` How glad master will be !\"\n", "they thought , and ran as fast as their legs could carry them.\n", "Now , on the way they had to cross a stream.\n", "The dog swam , and the cat sat on its back.\n", "Now the dog was jealous of the cat , so he asked for the ring , and threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it up ; whereupon the cat gave up the ring.\n", "Sorry moment , for the dog at once dropped it , and a fish swallowed it.\n", "`` Oh ! what shall I do ? what shall I do ?\"\n", "said the dog.\n", "`` What is done is done ,\"\n", "replied the cat.\n", "`` We must try to recover it , and if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream.\n", "I have a plan.\n", "You go and kill a small lamb , and bring it here to me\"\n", "`` All right ,\"\n", "said the dog , and at once ran off.\n", "He soon came back with a dead lamb , and gave it to the cat.\n", "The cat got inside the lamb and lay down , telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet.\n", "Not long after this a nadhar , a bird whose look can break the bones of a fish , came and hovered over the lamb , and eventually pounced down on it to carry it away.\n", "On this the cat came out and jumped on to the bird , and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring.\n", "This was most readily promised by the nadhar , who immediately flew off to the king of the fishes , and ordered it to make inquiries and to restore the ring.\n", "The king of the fishes did so , and the ring was found and carried back to the cat.\n", "`` Come along now ; I have got the ring ,\"\n", "said the cat to the dog.\n", "`` No , I will not ,\"\n", "said the dog , `` unless you let me have the ring.\n", "I can carry it as well as you.\n", "Let me have it or I will kill you\"\n", "So the cat was obliged to give up the ring.\n", "The careless dog very soon dropped it again.\n", "This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite.\n", "`` See , see , there it goes -- away to that big tree ,\"\n", "the cat exclaimed.\n", "`` Oh ! oh ! what have I done ?\"\n", "cried the dog.\n", "`` You foolish thing , I knew it would be so ,\"\n", "said the cat.\n", "`` But stop your barking , or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we shall not be able to trace it\"\n", "The cat waited till it was quite dark , and then climbed the tree , killed the kite , and recovered the ring.\n", "`` Come along ,\"\n", "it said to the dog when it reached the ground.\n", "`` We must make haste now.\n", "We have been delayed.\n", "Our master will die from grief and suspense.\n", "Come on\"\n", "The dog , now thoroughly ashamed of itself , begged the cat 's pardon for all the trouble it had given.\n", "It was afraid to ask for the ring the third time , so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and gave him the precious charm.\n", "In a moment his sorrow was turned into

then , gradually narrowing the circle , he pressed forward till he could distinctly see the white hind panting in the midst.\n", "Nearer and nearer he advanced , till , just as he thought to lay hold of the beautiful strange creature , it gave one mighty bound , leapt clean over the King 's head , and fled towards the mountains.\n", "Forgetful of all else , the King , setting spurs to his horse , followed at full speed.\n", "On , on he galloped , leaving his retinue far behind , keeping the white hind in view , never drawing bridle , until , finding himself in a narrow ravine with no outlet , he reined in his steed.\n", "Before him stood a miserable hovel , into which , being tired after his long , unsuccessful chase , he entered to ask for a drink of water.\n", "An old woman , seated in the hut at a spinning-wheel , answered his request by calling to her daughter , and immediately from an inner room came a maiden so lovely and charming , so white-skinned and golden-haired , that the King was transfixed by astonishment at seeing so beautiful a sight in the wretched hovel.\n", "She held the vessel of water to the King 's lips , and as he drank he looked into her eyes , and then it became clear to him that the girl was no other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet he had chased so far.\n", "Her beauty bewitched him , so he fell on his knees , begging her to return with him as his bride ; but she only laughed , saying seven person_0 were quite enough even for a King to manage.\n", "However , when he would take no refusal , but implored her to have pity on him , promising her everything she could desire , she replied , `` Give me the eyes of your seven person_0 , and then perhaps I may believe you mean what you say\"\n", "The King was so carried away by the glamour of the white hind 's magical beauty , that he went home at once , had the eyes of his seven person_0 taken out , and , after throwing the poor blind creatures into a noisome dungeon whence they could not escape , set off once more for the hovel in the ravine , bearing with him his horrible offering.\n", "But the white hind only laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes , and threading them as a necklace , flung it round her mother 's neck , saying , `` Wear that , little mother , as a keepsake , whilst I am away in the King 's palace\"\n", "Then she went back with the bewitched monarch , as his bride , and he gave her the seven person_0 ' rich clothes and jewels to wear , the seven person_0 ' palace to live in , and the seven person_0 ' slaves to wait upon her ; so that she really had everything even a witch could desire.\n", "Now , very soon after the seven wretched hapless person_0 had their eyes torn out , and were cast into prison , a baby was born to the youngest of the person_0.\n", "It was a handsome boy , but the other person_0 were very jealous that the youngest amongst them should be so fortunate.\n", "But though at first they disliked the handsome little boy , he soon proved so useful to them , that ere long they all looked on him as their son.\n", "Almost as soon as he could walk about he began scraping at the mud wall of their dungeon , and in an incredibly short space of time had made a hole big enough for him to crawl through.\n", "Through this he disappeared , returning in an hour or so laden with sweet-meats , which he divided equally amongst the seven blind person_0.\n", "As he grew older he enlarged the hole , and slipped out two or three times every day to play with the little nobles in the town.\n", "No one knew who the tiny boy was , but everybody liked him , and he was so full of funny tricks and antics , so merry and bright , that he was sure to be rewarded by some girdle-cakes , a handful of parched grain , or some sweetmeats.\n", "All these things he brought home to his seven mothers , as he loved to call the seven blind person_0 , who by his help lived on in their dungeon when all the world thought they had starved to death ages before.\n", "At last , when he was quite a big lad , he one day took his bow and arrow , and went out to seek for game.\n", "Coming by chance past the palace where the white hind lived in wicked splendor and magnificence , he saw some pigeons fluttering round the white marble turrets , and , taking good aim , shot one dead.\n", "It came tumbling past the very window where the white Queen was sitting ; she rose to see what was the matter , and looked out.\n", "At the first glance of the handsome young lad standing there bow in hand , she knew by witchcraft that it was the King 's son.\n", "She nearly died of envy and spite , determining to destroy the lad without delay ; therefore , sending a servant to bring him to her presence , she asked him if he would sell her the pigeon he had just shot.\n", "`` No ,\"\n", "replied the sturdy lad , `` the pigeon is for my seven blind mothers , who live in the noisome dungeon , and who would die if I did not bring them food\"\n", "`` Poor souls !\"\n", "cried the cunning white witch ; `` would you not like to bring them their eyes again ? Give me the pigeon , my dear , and I faithfully promise to show you where to find them\"\n", "Hearing this , the lad was delighted beyond measure , and gave up the pigeon at once.\n", "Whereupon the white Queen told him to seek her mother without delay , and ask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace.\n", "`` She will not fail to give them ,\"\n", "said the cruel Queen , `` if you show her this token on which I have written what I want done\"\n", "So saying , she gave the lad a piece of broken potsherd , with these words inscribed on it -- `` Kill the bearer at once , and sprinkle his blood like water !\"\n", "Now , as the son of seven person_0 could not read , he took the fatal message cheerfully , and set off to find the white Queen 's mother.\n", "Whilst he was journeying be passed through a town , where every one of the inhabitants looked so sad , that he could not help asking what was the matter.\n", "They told him it was because the King 's only daughter refused to marry ; so when her father died there would be no heir to the throne.\n", "They greatly feared she must be out of her mind , for though every good-looking young man in the kingdom had been shown to her , she declared she would only marry one who was the son of seven mothers , and who ever heard of such a thing ? The King , in despair , had ordered every man who entered the city gates to be led before the Princess ; so , much to the lad 's impatience , for he was in an immense hurry to find his mothers ' eyes , he was dragged into the presence-chamber.\n", "No sooner did the Princess catch sight of him than she blushed , and , turning to the King , said , `` Dear father , this is my choice !\"\n", "Never were such rejoicings as these few words produced.\n", "The inhabitants nearly went wild with joy , but the son of seven person_0 said he would not marry the Princess unless they first let him recover his mothers ' eyes.\n", "When the beautiful bride heard his story , she asked to see the potsherd , for she was very learned and clever.\n", "Seeing the treacherous words , she said nothing , but taking another similar-shaped bit of potsherd , she wrote on it these words -- `` Take care of this lad , giving him all he desires ,\"\n", "and returned it to the son of seven person_0 , who , none the wiser , set off on his quest.\n", "Ere long he arrived at the hovel in the ravine where the white witch 's mother , a hideous old creature , grumbled dreadfully on reading the message , especially when the lad asked for the necklace of eyes.\n", "Nevertheless she took it off , and gave it him , saying , `` There are only thirteen of 'em now , for I lost one last week\"\n", "The lad , however , was only too glad to get any at all , so he hurried home as fast as he could to his seven mothers , and gave two eyes apiece to the six elder person_0 ; but to the youngest he gave one , saying , `` Dearest little mother ! -- I will be your other eye always !\"\n", "After this he set off to marry the Princess , as he had promised , but when passing by the white Queen 's palace he saw some pigeons on the roof.\n", "Drawing his bow , he shot one , and it came fluttering past the window.\n", "The white hind looked out , and lo ! there was the King 's son alive and well.\n", "She cried with hatred and disgust , but sending for the lad , asked him how he had returned so soon , and when she heard how he had brought home the thirteen eyes , and given them to the seven blind person_0 , she could hardly restrain her rage.\n", "Nevertheless she pretended to be charmed with his success , and told him that if he would give her this pigeon also , she would reward him with the Jogi 's wonderful cow , whose milk flows all day long , and makes a pond as big as a kingdom.\n", "The lad , nothing loth , gave her the pigeon ; whereupon , as before , she bade him go ask her mother for the cow , and gave him a potsherd whereon was written -- `` Kill this lad without fail , and sprinkle his blood like water !\"\n", "But on the way the son of seven person_0 looked in on the Princess , just to tell her how he came to be delayed , and she , after reading the message on the potsherd , gave him another in its stead ; so that when the lad reached the old hag 's hut and asked her for the Jogi 's cow , she could not refuse , but told the boy how to find it ; and bidding him of all things not to be afraid of the eighteen thousand demons who kept watch and ward over the treasure , told him to be off before she became too angry at her daughter 's foolishness in thus giving away so many good things.\n", "Then the lad did as he had been told bravely.\n", "He journeyed on and on till he came to a milk-white pond , guarded by the eighteen thousand demons.\n", "They were really frightful to behold , but , plucking up courage , he whistled a tune as he walked through them , looking neither to the right nor the left.\n", "By-and-by he came upon the Jogi 's cow , tall , white , and beautiful , while the Jogi himself , who was king of all the demons , sat milking her day and night , and the milk streamed from her udder , filling the milk-white tank.\n", "The Jogi , seeing the lad , called out fiercely , `` What do you want here ?\"\n", "Then the lad answered , according to the old hag 's bidding , `` I want your skin , for King Indra is making a new kettle-drum , and says your skin is nice and tough\"\n", "Upon this the Jogi began to shiver and shake -LRB- for no Jinn or Jogi dares disobey King Indra 's command -RRB- , and , falling at the lad 's feet , cried , `` If you will spare me I will give you anything I possess , even my beautiful white cow !\"\n", "To this the son of seven person_0 , after a little pretended hesitation , agreed , saying that after all it would not be difficult to find a nice tough skin like the Jogi 's elsewhere ; so , driving the wonderful cow before him , he set off homewards.\n", "The seven person_0 were delighted to possess so marvellous an animal , and though they toiled from morning till night making curds and whey , besides selling milk to the confectioners , they could not use half the cow gave , and became richer and richer day by day.\n", "Seeing them so comfortably off , the son of seven person_0 started with a light heart to marry the Princess ; but when passing the white hind 's palace he could not resist sending a bolt at some pigeons which were cooing on the parapet.\n", "One fell dead just beneath the window where the white Queen was sitting.\n", "Looking out , she saw the lad hale and hearty standing before her , and grew whiter than ever with rage and spite.\n", "She sent for him to ask how he had returned so soon , and when she heard how kindly her mother had received him , she very nearly had a fit ; however , she dissembled her feelings as well as she could , and , smiling sweetly , said she was glad to have been able to fulfil her promise , and that if he would give her this third pigeon , she would do yet more for him than she had done before , by giving him the million-fold rice , which ripens in one night.\n", "The lad was of course delighted at the very idea , and , giving up the pigeon , set off on his quest , armed as before with a potsherd , on which was written , `` Do not fail this time.\n", "Kill the lad , and sprinkle his blood like water !\"\n", "But when he looked in on his Princess , just to prevent her becoming anxious about him , she asked to see the potsherd as usual , and substituted another , on which was written , `` Yet again give this lad all he requires , for his blood shall be as your blood !\"\n", "Now when the old hag saw this , and heard how the lad wanted the million-fold rice which ripens in a single night , she fell into the most furious rage , but being terribly afraid of her daughter , she controlled herself , and bade the boy go and find the field guarded by eighteen millions of demons , warning him on no account to look back after having plucked the tallest spike of rice , which grew in the center.\n", "So the son of seven person_0 set off , and soon came to the field where , guarded by eighteen millions of demons , the million-fold rice grew.\n", "He walked on bravely , looking neither to the right or left , till he reached the center and plucked the tallest ear , but as he turned homewards a thousand sweet voices rose behind him , crying in tenderest accents , `` Pluck me too ! oh , please pluck me too !\"\n", "He looked back , and lo ! there was nothing left of him but a little heap of ashes ! Now as time passed by and the lad did not return , the old hag grew uneasy , remembering the message `` his blood shall be as your blood\"\n", "; so she set off to see what had happened.\n", "Soon she came to the heap of ashes , and knowing by her arts what it was , she took a little water , and kneading the ashes into a paste , formed it into the likeness of a man ; then , putting a drop of blood from her little finger into its mouth , she blew on it , and instantly the son of seven person_0 started up as well as ever.\n", "`` Do n't you disobey orders again !\"\n", "grumbled the old hag , `` or next time I 'll leave you alone.\n", "Now be off , before I repent of my kindness !\"\n", "So the son of seven person_0 returned joyfully to his seven mothers , who , by the aid of the million-fold rice , soon became the richest people in the kingdom.\n", "Then they celebrated their son 's marriage to the clever Princess with all imaginable pomp ; but the bride was so clever , she would not rest until she had made known her husband to his father , and punished the wicked white witch.\n", "So she made her husband build a palace exactly like the one in which the seven person_0 had lived , and in which the white witch now dwelt in splendor.\n", "Then , when all was prepared , she bade her husband give a grand feast to the King.\n", "Now the King had heard much of the mysterious son of seven person_0 , and his marvellous wealth , so he gladly accepted the invitation ; but what was his astonishment when on entering the palace he found it was a facsimile of his own in every particular ! And when his host , richly attired , led him straight to the private hall , where on royal thrones sat the seven person_0 , dressed as he had last seen them , he was speechless with surprise , until the Princess , coming forward , threw herself at his feet , and told him the whole story.\n", "Then the King awoke from his enchantment , and his anger rose against the wicked white hind who had bewitched him so long , until he could not contain himself.\n", "So she was put to death , and her grave ploughed over , and after that the seven person_0 returned to their own splendid palace , and everybody lived happily\"\n", "There was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the hearth and poked the fire , and his wife sat and span.\n", "Then said he , `` How sad it is that we have no children ! With us all is so quiet , and in other houses it is noisy and lively\"\n", "`` Yes ,\"\n", "replied the wife , and sighed , `` even if we had only one , and it were quite small , and only as big as a thumb , I should be quite satisfied , and we would still love it with all our hearts\"\n", "Now it so happened that the woman fell ill , and after seven months gave birth to a child , that was perfect in all its limbs , but no longer than a thumb.\n", "Then said they , `` It is as we wished it to be , and it shall be our dear child ;\"\n", "and because of its size , they called it person_0.\n", "They did not let it want for food , but the child did not grow taller , but remained as it had been at the first , nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its eyes , and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature , for everything it did turned out well.\n", "One day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to cut wood , when he said as if to himself , `` How I wish that there was any one who would bring the cart to me !\"\n", "`` Oh father ,\"\n", "cried person_0 , `` I will soon bring the cart , rely on that ; it shall be in the forest at the appointed time\"\n", "The man smiled and said , `` How can that be done , thou art far too small to lead the horse by the reins ?\"\n", "`` That 's of no consequence , father , if my mother will only harness it , I shall sit in the horse 's ear and call out to him how he is to go\"\n", "`` Well ,\"\n", "answered the man , `` for once we will try it\"\n", "When the time came , the mother harnessed the horse , and placed person_0 in its ear , and then the little creature cried , `` Gee up , gee up !\"\n", "Then it went quite properly as if with its master , and the cart went the right way into the forest.\n", "It so happened that just as he was turning a corner , and the little one was crying , `` Gee up ,\"\n", "two strange men came towards him.\n", "`` My word !\"\n", "said one of them , `` What is this ?

person_1 saw that she could not persuade the old man to stay longer , she gave an order to some of her servants , and they at once brought in two boxes , one large and the other small.\n", "These were placed before the old man , and the person_1 asked him to choose whichever he liked for a present , which she wished to give him.\n", "The old man could not refuse this kind proposal , and he chose the smaller box , saying : `` I am now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box.\n", "As you are so kind as to say that I may take whichever I like , I will choose the small one , which will be easier for me to carry\"\n", "Then the sparrows all helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off , bidding him good-by with many bows and entreating him to come again whenever he had the time.\n", "Thus the old man and his pet sparrow separated quite happily , the sparrow showing not the least ill-will for all the unkindness she had suffered at the hands of the old wife.\n", "Indeed , she only felt sorrow for the old man who had to put up with it all his life.\n", "When the old man reached home he found his wife even crosser than usual , for it was late on in the night and she had been waiting up for him for a long time `` Where have you been all this time ?\"\n", "she asked in a big voice.\n", "`` Why do you come back so late ?\"\n", "The old man tried to pacify her by showing her the box of presents he had brought back with him , and then he told her of all that had happened to him , and how wonderfully he had been entertained at the sparrow 's house.\n", "`` Now let us see what is in the box ,\"\n", "said the old man , not giving her time to grumble again.\n", "`` You must help me open it\"\n", "And they both sat down before the box and opened it.\n", "To their utter astonishment they found the box filled to the brim with gold and silver coins and many other precious things.\n", "The mats of their little cottage fairly glittered as

expectations was the sparrow 's gift , which would enable him to give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days.\n", "He said : `` Thanks to my good little sparrow !

him the next time he went out to fish.\n", "This was just what the rabbit wanted , so he agreed.\n", "Then he went home and built two boats , one of wood and the other of clay.\n", "At last they were

day came when the rabbit had arranged to take the badger fishing.\n", "He kept the wooden boat himself and gave the badger the clay boat.\n", "The badger , who knew nothing about boats , was delighted

to drown with no one to help him.\n", "Then he raised his oar and struck at the badger with all his strength till he fell with the sinking clay boat and was seen no more.\n", "Thus at last he kept his promise to the old farmer.\n", "The rabbit now turned and rowed shorewards , and having landed and pulled his boat upon the beach , hurried back to tell the old farmer everything , and how the badger , his enemy , had been killed.\n", "The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes.\n", "He said that till now he could never sleep at night or be at peace in the daytime , thinking of how his wife

to walk home.\n", "But on looking out from the tree , what was his amazement to see , not his friends , but hundreds of demons coming towards the spot.\n", "The more he looked , the greater was his astonishment.\n", "Some of these demons were as large as giants , others had great big eyes out of all proportion to the rest of their bodies , others again had absurdly long noses , and some had such

entertainment and enjoying themselves immensely.\n", "It made the old man laugh to see their strange antics.\n", "`` How amusing this is !\"\n", "laughed the old man to himself `` I am now quite old ,

not make it , it was made by the rough animal\"\n", "The person_0 said , `` Go and bid it come up here\"\n", "When Allerleirauh came , the person_0 said , `` Who art thou ?\"\n", "`` I am a poor girl who no longer has any father or mother\"\n", "He asked further , `` Of what use art thou in my palace ?\"\n", "She answered , `` I am good for nothing but to have boots thrown at my head\"\n", "He continued , `` Where didst thou get the ring which was in the soup ?\"\n", "She answered , `` I know nothing about the ring\"\n", "So the person_0 could learn nothing , and had to send her away again.\n", "After a while , there was another festival , and then , as before , Allerleirauh begged the cook for leave to go and look on.\n", "He answered , `` Yes , but come back again in half-an-hour , and make the person_0 the bread soup which he so much likes\"\n", "Then she ran into her den , washed herself quickly , and took out of the nut the dress which was as silvery as the moon , and put it on.\n", "Then she went up and was like a princess , and the person_0 stepped forward to meet her , and rejoiced to see her once more , and as the dance was just beginning they danced it together.\n", "But when it was ended , she again disappeared so quickly that the person_0 could not observe where she went.\n", "She , however , sprang into her den , and once more made herself a hairy animal , and went into the kitchen to prepare the bread soup.\n", "When the cook had gone up-stairs , she fetched the little golden spinning-wheel , and put it in the bowl so that the soup covered it.\n", "Then it was taken to the person_0 , who ate it , and liked it as much as before , and had the cook brought , who this time likewise was forced to confess that Allerleirauh had prepared the soup.\n", "Allerleirauh again came before the person_0 , but she answered that she was good for nothing else but to have boots thrown at her head , and that she knew nothing at all about the little golden spinning-wheel.\n", "When , for the third time , the person_0 held a festival , all happened just as it had done before.\n", "The cook said , `` Faith rough-skin , thou art a witch , and always puttest something in the soup which makes it so good that the person_0 likes it better than that which I cook ,\"\n", "but as she begged so hard , he let her go up at the appointed time.\n", "And now she put on the dress which shone like the stars , and thus entered the hall.\n", "Again the person_0 danced with the beautiful maiden , and thought that she never yet had been so beautiful.\n", "And whilst she was dancing , he contrived , without her noticing it , to slip a golden ring on her finger , and he had given orders that the dance should last a very long time.\n", "When it was ended , he wanted to hold her fast by her hands , but she tore herself loose , and sprang away so quickly through the crowd that she vanished from his sight.\n", "She ran as fast as she could into her den beneath the stairs , but as she had been too long , and had stayed more than half-an-hour she could not take off her pretty dress , but only threw over it her fur-mantle , and in her haste she did not make herself quite black , but one finger remained white.\n", "Then Allerleirauh ran into the kitchen , and cooked the bread soup for the person_0 , and as the cook was away , put her golden reel into it.\n", "When the person_0 found the reel at the bottom of it , he caused Allerleirauh to be summoned , and then he espied the white finger , and saw the ring which he had put on it during the dance.\n", "Then he grasped her by the hand , and held her fast , and when she wanted to release herself and run away , her mantle of fur opened a little , and the star-dress shone forth.\n", "The person_0 clutched the mantle and tore it off.\n", "Then her golden hair shone forth , and she stood there in full splendor , and could no longer hide herself.\n", "And when she had washed the soot and ashes from her face , she was more beautiful than anyone who had ever been seen on earth.\n", "But the person_0 said , `` Thou art my dear bride , and we will never more part from each other\"\n", "Thereupon the marriage was solemnized , and they lived happily until their death\"\n", "Long , long ago there was a large plain called Adachigahara , in the province of Mutsu in Japan.\n", "This place was said to be haunted by a cannibal goblin who took the form of an old woman.\n", "From time to time many travelers disappeared and were never heard of more , and the old women round the charcoal braziers in the evenings , and the girls washing the household rice at the wells in the mornings , whispered dreadful stories of how the missing folk had been lured to the goblin 's cottage and devoured , for the goblin lived only on human flesh.\n", "No one dared to venture near the haunted spot after sunset , and all those who could , avoided it in the daytime , and travelers were warned of the dreaded place.\n", "One day as the sun was setting , a priest came to the plain.\n", "He was a belated traveler , and his robe showed that he was a Buddhist pilgrim walking from shrine to shrine to pray for some blessing or to crave for forgiveness of sins.\n", "He had apparently lost his way , and as it was late he met no one who could show him the road or warn him of the haunted spot.\n", "He had walked the whole day and was now tired and hungry , and the evenings were chilly , for it was late autumn , and he began to be very anxious to find some house where he could obtain a night 's lodging.\n", "He found himself lost in the midst of the large plain , and looked about in vain for some sign of human habitation.\n", "At last , after wandering about for some hours , he saw a clump of trees in the distance , and through the trees he caught sight of the glimmer of a single ray of light.\n", "He exclaimed with joy : `` Oh.\n", "surely that is some cottage where I can get a night 's lodging !\"\n", "Keeping the light before his eyes he dragged his weary , aching feet as quickly as he could towards the spot , and soon came to a miserable-looking little cottage.\n", "As he drew near he saw that it was in a tumble-down condition , the bamboo fence was broken and weeds and grass pushed their way through the gaps.\n", "The paper screens which serve as windows and doors in Japan were full of holes , and the posts of the house were bent with age and seemed scarcely able to support the old thatched roof.\n", "The hut was open , and by the light of an
