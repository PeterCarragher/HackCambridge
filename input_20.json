-- Good father Andrew scorned to use finesse , And in discourse the sex would thus address.
All Nature carefully the law reveres , That gratitude and fealty endears.
In short 'twas difficult to say , What charity was shown from day to day.
That makes no difference , the lady cried.
-- What tithe ? cried he ; it surely has a name.
Not know ! astonishingly , replied the wife.
See if it looks more modern in my page.
Some ostentation ever is with grief Those who weep most the soonest gain relief.
Have loved her -- even though she were a wife.
A LIVING drum-boy , truly be it said , Is better far , than any monarch dead"
Our husband thought his purse not over strong , That saving fifty crowns would not be wrong.
THIS scene just ended , t ` other actor came , Whose prompt"
-LRB- I scarcely can proceed -RRB- To tie.
A chapter instantly the lady held ; Long time upon the circumstance they dwelled.
This work so well the aged troop achieved , He long remembered what his skin received.
WHILE thus the master chastisement had got ; His mule was feeding on the verdant spot.
` Tis quite enough to save the young gallant , And more particulars we do not want.
TO suitors , howsoe'er , he was not blind ; To covet presents , greatly he inclined.
Besides , your friends assuredly should know What mind , what sentiments may from her flow.
But you 'll be present , said the courteous knight.
And what of that ? rejoined the wily spouse.
WHEN our gallant the charming belle perceived ; Elysium seemed around , he half believed.
Jack brought the couple presently to meet.
The lady found , howe'er , not what she sought : No guilty spouse , nor Mrs.
At this our arch gallant with laughter burst.
THUS Richard pleasantly employed his time , Contented lived , concentring joys sublime.
On board they had a man or two at most.
And each the best adventure hop 'd to boast.
TOO much affection parents ne'er can show : -- A mother 's feelings none but mothers know.
The poverty in which he now was viewed , Distressed his mind and all his griefs renewed.
.
-- Dead ? -- exclaimed the dame , While trembling terror overspread her frame.
When kind , they 're ev ` ry blessing found below : When otherwise a curse we often know"
Few enemies their modesty attack ; The others have but one their minds to rack.
The eight encircled him with great surprise ; No longer dumb.
NO sooner had Aminta gone away , But she for Cleon sent without delay.
A lovely blush o ` erspread Aminta 's face , And gave her lily-cheeks superior grace.
He praised her person , artifice , and wit , And did whate'er the moments would admit"
HE surely must be wrong who loving fears ; And does not flee when beauty first appears.
Far better surely mortals here might do ; There 's no occasion dangers to pursue.
HER name was Alibech , if I recollect ; Too innocent , deceptions to detect.
WITH silent steps the innocent withdrew ; To mothers , sisters , -- none she bade adieu.
THE hermit surely would have acted right ; Such pupil to have sent away at sight.
He managed otherwise , as we shall state ; The consequences , let us now relate.
The hermit fasted ; but the lady fed , And ate with appetite her fruit and bread.
These , however , were the two ministers.
She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him.
In the white lily bloom , Brave boy , is thy tomb"
When the two heard that , they were frightened to death , and ran away in great haste.
When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog.
Then the King said , `` What God does , is well done !"
In the white lily bloom , Brave boy , is thy tomb"
The fisherman , however , fished this one also out of the water , and reared him.
In the white lily bloom , Bonny girl , is thy tomb"
And when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat.
In the meantime the children had grown up.
So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father.
`` Good day , mother ,"
said the boy.
`` Many thanks ,"
said she.
`` Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything"
`` And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father.
How wilt thou get over the water ?"
said the woman.
`` God knows"
When a year had gone by , the second boy set out to seek his brother.
He came to the water , and all fared with him just as with his brother.
`` Many thanks ,"
replied the old woman.
`` May God help you with your fishing ,"
said the maiden.
There the old woman was still standing.
But the second son could not settle at home , and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting.
When he was tired he took his flute , and made music.
`` Oh , no one"
`` To whom dost thou belong , then ?"
`` I am the fisherman 's son"
`` But he has no children"
`` If thou wilt not believe , come with me"
She had , however , grown quite ill and weak.
But the two false sisters were burnt , and the daughter married the prince"
`` But we must make a provision for winter , or else we shall suffer from hunger ,"
Let me go out to-day , and you look after the house by yourself"
`` Yes , yes ,"
`` Well , here you are again ,"
said the mouse , `` no doubt you have had a merry day"
`` All went off well ,"
answered the cat.
`` What name did they give the child ?"
`` Top off !"
said the cat quite coolly.
`` Top off !"
`` What does it signify ,"
said the cat , `` it is no worse than Crumb-stealer , as your god-children are called"
Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing.
`` Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself ,"
said she , and was quite satisfied with her day 's work.
When she went home the mouse inquired , `` And what was this child christened ?"
`` Half-done ,"
answered the cat.
The cat 's mouth soon began to water for some more licking.
`` All good things go in threes ,"
said she , `` I am asked to stand godmother again.
`` Top-off ! Half-done !"
answered the mouse , `` they are such odd names , they make me very thoughtful"
`` You sit at home ,"
`` When everything is eaten up one has some peace ,"
said she to herself , and well filled and fat she did not return home till night.
The mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child.
`` It will not please you more than the others ,"
said the cat.
`` He is called All-gone"
`` All-gone ,"
All-gone ; what can that mean ?"
and she shook her head , curled herself up , and lay down to sleep.
`` Yes ,"
`` Alas !"
First top off , then half done , then --"
`` Will you hold your tongue ,"
cried the cat , `` one word more and I will eat you too"
`` All gone"
Verily , that is the way of the world"
As he went , a poor man met him , who asked him where he was going.
`` Oh ,"
Go home and tell the nurse that she is to come to the church with the child"
`` Oh , yes ,"
Then the boy went thither , but no castle was to be seen , or heard of.
When he had opened it , there was nothing within but a horse , a white one.
`` Now I have a white horse , and I will travel ,"
said he.
He looked around , but saw no one , then he went back again and picked it up.
and he took hold of it by the tail , and threw it into the lake.
`` Oh , to the next place"
Then what his name was ? `` Ferdinand the Faithful"
`` So ! then we have got almost the same name , I am called Ferdinand the Unfaithful"
And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place.
`` Oh , I am just traveling round about ,"
said he.
He answered he could not very well go to any one like that and offer himself.
Then said the maiden , `` Oh , but I will soon do that for you"
`` Oh ,"
said the girl , `` I will help thee too"
She thought , `` I must keep friends with that man , for he is not to be trusted"
She went to the King , and offered him as a servant , and the King was willing.
Ferdinand the Unfaithful was , however , always hostile to Ferdinand the Faithful.
Then someone behind him cried , `` Ferdinand the Faithful , why weepest thou ?"
Then some one cried once more , `` Ferdinand the Faithful , why weepest thou ?"
`` Dost thou speak , my little white horse ; canst thou do that ?"
Then go up to the castle , and take a couple of giants with thee.
Then the little white horse said he was just to load the ships full again.
And Ferdinand the Faithful went in , and fetched them.
So he took the writings to the castle , where the wedding was celebrated.
Then the King said to her , `` My child , and where hast thou learned that ?"
`` Yes ,"
she said , `` I understand the art ; shall I just try it on thee also ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said he.
Then the King was buried , but she married Ferdinand the Faithful.
Whenever she saw , or thought of him , she felt a secret horror.
The maiden replied , `` I know not where thy house is"
Then said the bridegroom , `` My house is out there in the dark forest"
She tried to excuse herself and said she could not find the way there.
She went inside it , but no one was within , and the most absolute stillness reigned.
`` Can you not tell me ,"
said the maiden , `` if my betrothed lives here ?"
`` Alas , poor child ,"
replied the old woman , `` whither hast thou come ? Thou art in a murderer 's den.
If I do not have compassion on thee , and save thee , thou art lost"
Thereupon the old woman led her behind a great hogshead where she could not be seen.
`` Be as still as a mouse ,"
Hardly was this done , than the godless crew came home.
They dragged with them another young girl.
They were drunk , and paid no heed to her screams and lamentations.
The robber took a candle and wanted to look for it , but could not find it.
Then another of them said , `` Hast thou looked behind the great hogshead ?"
Then the robbers said , `` The old woman is right ,"
But God helped her , and she got safely over.
As they sat at table , each was bidden to relate something.
The bride sat still , and said nothing.
She replied , `` Then I will relate a dream.
And this it cried once more.
` My darling , I only dreamt this.
' My darling , I only dreamt this.
My darling , I only dreamt this.
My darling , I only dreamt this.
And there is the finger with the ring !"
And with these words she drew it forth , and showed it to those present.
Then he and his whole troop were executed for their infamous deeds"
`` Just show me for once in a way what you can do ,"
said the host.
`` If you can do that ,"
said the innkeeper , `` you have learned everything"
The girl , however , had a lover in secret , who was a soldier.
`` Be easy ,"
Which hand was it ?"
`` The right one"
`` Have you not been killing , and are not the dead pigs in the cellar ?"
said he.
`` Yes ,"
said the girl.
`` That 's well ,"
said the soldier , and he went down and fetched a pig 's heart.
The second took the cat 's eyes and put them in his own head.
Then they paid their bill , and traveled farther.
Will one of you lead me , so that I do not fall"
Then with difficulty they traveled on till evening , when they reached another inn.
`` Eh ,"
`` Brothers , just look up , do you see the white mice running about there ?"
The two sat up , but could see nothing.
We must return to the innkeeper , he has deceived us"
And a crane thought on seeing the fish.
`` I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them"
`` I am sitting thinking about you ,"
said he.
`` Oh , sir ! what are you thinking about us ?"
said they.
`` Why ,"
`` Yes , indeed , sir ! what _ are _ we to do ?"
said they.
answered the crane.
It 's eating us , one after the other , that you 're aiming at"
`` Not I ! So long as you trust me , I wo n't eat you.
And he told them all the glories of the pond.
Come along.
I 'll take you too !"
`` But how will you take hold of me to carry me along ?"
`` I 'll bite hold of you with my beak"
`` You 'll let me fall if you carry me like that.
I wo n't go with you !"
`` Do n't be afraid ! I 'll hold you quite tight all the way"
And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him , and agreed.
And the crane took him and showed him the pond , and then turned off towards the Varana-tree.
`` Uncle !"
cried the crab , `` the pond lies that way , but you are taking me this way !"
`` Oh , that 's it , is it ?"
answered the crane.
`` Ah ! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity ,"
answered the crab ; `` but I 'm not going to let you eat _ me _.
On the contrary , is it _ you _ that I am going to destroy.
For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting you.
Grant me my life !"
`` Well , well ! step down into the pond , and put me in there"
He may win indeed , sharp-witted in deceit , But only as the Crane here from the Crab !"
The youth was sent into a strange town , and remained a whole year with the master.
`` Father , I have learned what the dogs say when they bark"
`` Lord have mercy on us !"
The youth was taken thither , and stayed a year with this master likewise.
When he came back the father again asked , `` My son , what hast thou learned ?"
He answered , `` Father , I have learned what the birds say"
he answered , `` Dear father , I have this year learned what the frogs croak"
`` Yes ,"
After some time he took it into his head that he would travel to Rome.
`` Ah , dear little master ,"
I am afraid the strings would not last"
No excuses were of any use.
The donkey said , `` Here we will stay ,"
knocked at the gate , and cried , `` A guest is without open , that he may enter"
`` Then let the musician come to me ,"
said the King.
When , however , a donkey came in , every one began to laugh at the lute-player.
And now the donkey was asked to sit down and eat with the servants.
Then they said , `` If that is what thou art , seat thyself with the men of war"
`` No ,"
said he , `` I will sit by the King"
Then he asked , `` Little ass , how does my daughter please thee ?"
`` Well , then , thou shalt sit next her too ,"
said the King.
`` That is exactly what I wish ,"
let his head hang sadly , and went to the King and asked for his dismissal.
Dost thou want gold ?"
`` No ,"
said the donkey , and shook his head.
`` Dost thou want jewels and rich dress ?"
`` No"
`` Dost thou wish for half my kingdom ?"
`` Indeed , no"
Then said the King , `` if I did but know what would make thee content.
Wilt thou have my pretty daughter to wife ?"
`` Ah , yes ,"
said the ass , `` I should indeed like her ,"
So a great and splendid wedding was held.
`` Now ,"
Then the bride was glad , and kissed him , and loved him dearly.
Soon came the old King , `` Ah ,"
cried he , `` is the little ass merry ? But surely thou art sad ?"
said he to his daughter , `` that thou hast not got a proper man for thy husband ?"
The King was surprised , but the servant who had concealed himself came and revealed everything to him.
The King said , `` That can not be true"
`` Thy advice is good ,"
said the youth.
As he could stay no longer with him , he went quite sadly away.
The dog replied , `` I am hungry , and have nothing to eat"
Then the dog seized it , ran into a corner , and devoured it.
`` Yes , I have had meat enough ,"
he answered , `` but I have had no bread yet"
Said the sparrow , `` Thou shalt have that also , come with me"
When that was consumed , the sparrow said , `` Brother dog , hast thou now had enough ?"
`` Yes ,"
he replied , `` now we will walk awhile outside the town"
Then they both went out on to the highway.
`` Well , do sleep ,"
answered the sparrow , `` and in the meantime I will seat myself on a branch"
So the dog lay down on the road , and fell fast asleep.
The waggoner , however , growled to himself , `` Thou wilt not make me poor ,"
and cracked his whip and drove the cart over the dog , and the wheels killed him.
`` Cart and horses indeed !"
said the waggoner.
`` What harm canst thou do me ?"
and drove onwards.
`` Unfortunate fellow that I am ,"
cried he.
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
`` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am ,"
cried he.
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
but the sparrow replied , `` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
and seated himself on the head of the second horse , and pecked his eyes out.
`` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am"
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
said the sparrow , and lighted on the third horse 's head , and pecked out his eyes.
`` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am ,"
cried he.
`` Not unfortunate enough yet ,"
answered the sparrow.
`` Now will I make thee unfortunate in thy home ,"
and flew away.
The driver had to leave the waggon standing , and full of anger and vexation went home.
`` Ah ,"
`` Alas , husband ,"
Then the driver cried , `` Oh , what an unfortunate man I am ?"
`` Not unfortunate enough yet !"
answered the sparrow ; `` waggoner , it shall cost thee thy life as well ,"
and flew out.
At length , however , he caught it with his hand.
Then his wife said , `` Shall I kill it ?"
`` No ,"
cried he , `` that would be too merciful.
It shall die much more cruelly ,"
and he took it and swallowed it whole.
But the sparrow flew up and away"
There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie.
And when she had grown up her father said , `` We will get her married"
`` Yes ,"
said the mother ; `` if only any one would come who would have her"
`` Oh ,"
said the father , `` she 's sharp enough ;"
`` Well ,"
said Hans , `` if she is not really wise , I wo n't have her"
Those upstairs waited for the drink , but Clever Elsie still did not come.
The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel , screaming loudly.
`` Elsie , why weepest thou ?"
asked the maid.
`` Ah ,"
Then said the maid , `` What a clever Elsie we have !"
and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.
The boy went down , and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together.
Then he asked , `` Why are ye weeping ?"
`` Ah ,"
Then said the boy , `` What a clever Elsie we have !"
and sat down by her , and likewise began to howl loudly.
Then said the mother likewise , `` What a clever Elsie we have !"
and sat down and wept with them.
and sat down , and likewise wept with them.
`` What misfortune has happened then ?"
he asked.
`` Ah , dear Hans ,"
`` Come ,"
and he seized her hand , took her upstairs with him , and married her.
`` Yes , dear Hans , I will do that"
Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.
Then he ran home , shut the house-door , and sat down in his chair and worked.
`` Yes ,"
answered Hans , `` she is within"
Hereupon she was terrified , and said , `` Ah , heavens ! Then it is not I ,"
Then she ran out of the village , and no one has seen her since"
There was once a King 's son who was betrothed to a maiden whom he loved very much.
When I am King , I will return and fetch thee"
and he named a certain King 's daughter who was to be his wife.
and thereupon the King shut his eyes , and died.
The father said , `` If it be possible , thy desire shall be fulfilled ,"
and that he would willingly take them , and now they were the King 's twelve huntsmen.
`` Yes ,"
said the King , `` they are twelve huntsmen"
The lion continued , `` Thou art mistaken , they are twelve girls"
The King said , `` That can not be true ! How wilt thou prove that to me ?"
`` Oh , just let some peas be strewn in thy ante-chamber ,"
answered the lion , `` and then thou wilt soon see it.
The King was well pleased with the counsel , and caused the peas to be strewn.
The King liked the advice , and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.
The King , however , would no longer believe the lion.
Then it was foretold to the King that his daughter should eat herself well with an apple.
The lad did so , and set out.
On this the little man said , `` Well , so shall it be , and remain ,"
and went away.
On this the King grew angry , and had him driven out of the house.
When he got home he told his father how it had fared with him.
He also met the little iron man , who asked what he had there in the basket.
Seame said , `` Hogs ' bristles ,"
and the iron man said , `` well , so shall it be , and remain"
At length they believed him , and led him to the King.
But when he uncovered the basket , he had but hogs ' bristles.
`` Oh !"
`` Just get away , thou stupid fellow , thou must wait till thou art wiser ,"
said the father to that , and turned his back.
replied the old man in a spiteful voice.
The boy , however , was tremendously delighted and jumped for joy.
`` Well , act like a fool ! thou growest more stupid every day !"
said the father again.
`` Then ,"
said the little man , `` so shall they be , and remain"
Then the father sent Uele into the forest to make a boat of that kind.
He worked diligently , and whistled all the time.
The iron man said , `` So it shall be , and remain"
On the third day Stupid Hans went.
`` Well ,"
said the little man , `` such an one shall it be , and remain"
He got into it and rowed to the palace.
The boat went as swiftly as the wind.
The maid told this in the palace , and the daughter did go herself.
`` Good ,"
Hans set out at once , and walked straight forwards.
`` Yes , indeed ,"
said Hans , `` I will do that"
The man asked Hans whither he was journeying ? `` To the Griffin ,"
said Hans.
`` Then when you get to him ,"
said the man , `` just ask him why I am forced to carry everybody over the lake"
`` Yes , indeed , most certainly I 'll do that ,"
said Hans.
Then the man took him up on his shoulders , and carried him across.
Hans was quite satisfied with this , and got under the bed.
`` Yes ,"
said the woman , `` one was here to-day , but he went away again ;"
and on that the Griffin said no more.
`` Oh ! the fools !"
`` Oh ! the fools !"
`` Oh , the fool !"
Early the next morning the Griffin got up and went out.
Then Hans told him that the Griffin gave every one whatsoever he wanted.
Hans , however , married the daughter , and became King"
The trees rustled in the darkness , the owls hooted , and she began to be afraid.
Then in the distance she perceived a light which glimmered between the trees.
`` There ought to be some people living there , who can take me in for the night ,"
thought she , and went up to the light.
She knocked , and a rough voice from inside cried , `` Come in"
The girl stepped into the dark entrance , and knocked at the door of the room.
`` Just come in ,"
By the stove lay three animals , a hen , a cock , and a brindled cow.
The girl told her story to the old man , and begged for shelter for the night.
`` Duks ,"
answered the animals , and that must have meant , `` We are willing ,"
`` It is not my fault ,"
`` I will take a bag with lentils ,"
At dinner-time , therefore , the girl took out the food , but the lentils had disappeared.
The animals again replied `` Duks ,"
and everything happened just as it had happened the day before.
`` Have no fear ,"
They are still larger than lentils , and will show her the way"
`` Duks ,"
said they.
`` I hope you will like it , dear animals ,"
said she , `` and you shall have a refreshing draught in case you are thirsty"
Then said the girl , `` Ought we not to go to bed ?"
The animals answered `` Duks ,"
The girl lay down on the other , said her prayers , and fell asleep.
`` But where are my two sisters ?"
inquired the maiden.
When the princess grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance.
`` If you are thirsty ,"
Then she said , `` Ah , Heaven !"
and the three drops of blood answered , `` If thy mother knew , her heart would break"
But the King 's daughter was humble , said nothing , and mounted her horse again.
for she had long ago forgotten the girl 's ill words.
and the drops of blood again replied , `` If thy mother knew this , her heart would break"
and the princess had to be content with that.
But Falada saw all this , and observed it well.
She was conducted upstairs , but the real princess was left standing below.
The boy was called Conrad , and the true bride had to help him to tend the geese.
He answered , `` I will do so most willingly"
Then they went still further out of the town , and drove their geese into the country.
`` Why not ?"
inquired the aged King.
`` Oh , because she vexes me the whole day long"
Then the aged King commanded him to relate what it was that she did to him.
He urged her and left her no peace , but he could draw nothing from her.
and he went away.
If my mother did but know that , her heart would break"
Then he came back again , and bade her come out of the stove.
`` It is thou ,"
and then it will vanish again from thy sight"
Hereupon the wise woman departed.
and helped herself to some food , and enjoyed it.
and immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again.
`` That is a delightful way of keeping house !"
thought Two-eyes , and was quite glad and happy.
and in an instant all was gone.
Come , let us go home again"
but then , instead of singing , `` Three eyes , are you sleeping ?"
as she ought to have done , she thoughtlessly sang , `` Two eyes , are you sleeping ?"
and Three-eyes had seen everything.
and all disappears.
I watched everything closely.
`` Have I not reason to weep ?"
she answered.
Then they laughed and said , `` If that 's all you want , you can have it"
One-eye slipped down , and Three-eyes climbed up.
Then said Two-eyes , `` I will just go up , perhaps I may succeed better"
The sisters cried , `` You indeed , with your two eyes , what can you do ?"
`` Quick , Two-eyes ,"
cried the two sisters , `` creep under this , and do n't disgrace us !"
They again asserted that the tree was their property.
When the knight saw the apples he was astonished , and asked where they came from.
The knight , however , desired to see her , and cried , `` Two-eyes , come forth"
`` Yes ,"
replied Two-eyes , `` that I certainly shall be able to do , for the tree belongs to me"
Then said the knight , `` Two-eyes , what shall I give thee for it ?"
`` Alas !"
`` The wonderful tree , however , still remains with us ,"
Who knows what good things may be in store for us ?"
But next morning , the tree had vanished , and all their hopes were at an end.
Two-eyes lived a long time in happiness.
Once two poor women came to her in her castle , and begged for alms.
One evening the student came through the back door to buy candles and cheese for himself.
He had no one to send , and that 's why he came himself.
`` Yonder lies some more of the same sort ,"
`` Yes ,"
It would be a sin to tear the book up entirely.
And the goblin laid the tongue upon the cask in which the old newspapers were lying.
`` Is it true ,"
he asked , `` that you do n't know what poetry means ?"
`` Of course I know it ,"
`` Now I shall tell it to the student !"
`` This is an incomparable place ,"
`` I must divide myself between the two ,"
he said ; `` I ca n't quite give up the huckster , because of the porridge !"
Now , that was spoken quite like a human creature.
We all of us visit the huckster for the sake of the porridge"
Eating the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.
In vain he declared his innocence ; he was dismissed with no better answer.
The servant stood by and listened.
`` Yes ,"
`` Out with you , you idle , good-for-nothing creatures !"
But he heard a rustling in the branches , and a golden apple fell into his hand.
There was once a poor woodcutter who toiled from early morning till late night.
`` Ah ,"
`` Dear father ,"
`` Nay , my son ,"
`` Just go to the neighbor ,"
answered the son , `` he will lend you his axe until I have earned one for myself"
The son helped his father and was quite merry and brisk about it.
`` Oh , you fool ,"
Then all at once it seemed to him that he heard a voice.
Then he cried , `` Where art thou ?"
The voice answered , `` I am down here amongst the roots of the oak-tree.
Let me out ! Let me out !"
`` Let me out ! Let me out !"
it cried anew , and the scholar thinking no evil , drew the cork out of the bottle.
`` Knowest thou ,"
he cried in an awful voice , `` what thy wages are for having let me out ?"
`` No ,"
replied the scholar fearlessly , `` how should I know that ?"
`` Then I will tell thee ,"
cried the spirit ; `` I must strangle thee for it"
`` Thou shouldst have told me that sooner ,"
`` More persons here , more persons there ,"
said the spirit.
`` Thou shalt have the wages thou hast earned.
Dost thou think that I was shut up there for such a long time as a favor.
No , it was a punishment for me.
I am the mighty Mercurius.
Whoso releases me , him must I strangle"
`` Softly ,"
answered the scholar , `` not so fast.
The spirit said haughtily , `` that is a very trifling feat ,"
`` No ,"
`` If thou wilt set me free ,"
`` No ,"
answered the boy , `` thou wouldst cheat me as thou didst the first time"
`` Thou art playing away with thy own good luck ,"
said the spirit ; `` I will do thee no harm but will reward thee richly"
`` Now thou shalt have thy reward ,"
`` I must just try that ,"
It immediately closed together and was healed.
`` Now , it is all right ,"
he said to the spirit , `` and we can part"
`` Where hast thou been racing about ?"
`` Be easy , father , I will make it up"
`` Make it up indeed ,"
said the father angrily , `` there 's no art in that"
`` Take care , father , I will soon hew that tree there , so that it will split"
`` Do n't get angry ,"
said the son , `` I will soon pay for the axe"
`` Oh , thou blockhead ,"
These are students ' tricks that are sticking in thy head , but thou hast no idea of wood-cutting"
`` Eh , what !"
Do go with me"
The son said , `` Give me what thou hast , I will lend you the rest"
The goldsmith gave him three hundred thalers , and remained a hundred in his debt.
`` I know that already ,"
answered the old man , `` one thaler , six groschen"
`` Good heavens !"
said the father , `` how hast thou come by these riches ?"
There he passed many years , and no one could deliver him.
After she had wandered about for nine days , she at length came to the iron stove.
She answered , `` I have lost my father 's kingdom , and can not get home again"
I am the son of a far greater King than thy father , and I will marry thee"
So she was taken thither , and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours.
She , however , made nothing of it.
She thought , `` Ah , whither have I come ,"
Then she took courage , and knocked at the door.
and a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her.
When she entered , they all bade her welcome , and she was forced to sit down.
They asked , `` Where hast thou come from , and whither art thou going ?"
Then the little one went and brought the box.
If she did all this she would get her lover back again.
Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages.
When it was evening she said to her bridegroom , `` That silly girl will sleep in thy room"
`` If thou art willing so am I ,"
said he.
She , however , gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught.
The King 's son was , however , on his guard , and threw the sleeping-draught away.
A mouse did run , This story is done"
A rich farmer was one day standing in his yard inspecting his fields and gardens.
The corn was growing up vigorously and the fruit-trees were heavily laden with fruit.
If a beggar came , I turned away my eyes from him.
I have not troubled myself about God , but have thought only of increasing my wealth.
If everything which the sky covers had been mine own , I should still not have had enough"
Then there was another knock , but the knock was at the door of his room.
`` I know ,"
My children are starving , lend me four measures \* of corn"
`` I will not lend thee four measures ,"
`` What am I to do ?"
said the poor man.
`` When I am dead , thou shalt watch for three nights by my grave"
No one knew exactly how it came to pass , but no one grieved for him.
At nightfall he went into the churchyard , and seated himself on the grave-mound.
He was entirely covered with an old cloak , and nothing was visible but his great riding-boots.
`` What are you looking for here ?"
the peasant asked.
`` Are you not afraid of the lonely churchyard ?"
`` I am looking for nothing ,"
`` If you are without fear ,"
said the peasant , `` stay with me , and help me to watch that grave there"
`` To keep watch is a soldier 's business ,"
The peasant agreed to this , and they seated themselves on the grave together.
`` Be off , you ragamuffins !"
`` Sir with the red feather ,"
Go away , we shall stay sitting here"
`` I have not so much as that about me ,"
said the person_0 , `` but I will fetch it.
`` That will do ,"
said he ; `` now the chimney-sweep may come"
`` Just pour it in ,"
said the soldier , raising up the boot a little , `` but that wo n't be enough"
`` Stupid person_0 ,"
`` Now pour it in ,"
cried the soldier , `` but I doubt the boot wo n't be full"
The gold clinked as it fell , but the boot remained empty.
The person_0 looked in himself with his burning eyes , and convinced himself of the truth.
`` You have shamefully big calves to your legs !"
cried he , and made a wry face.
`` Did you think ,"
The Wicked One went off again.
He emptied it into the boot , which was just as far from being filled as before.
The poor soul was saved.
Master Pfriem was a short , thin , but lively man , who never rested a moment.
He saw everything , criticised everything , knew everything best , and was always in the right.
`` Stupid thing ,"
`` Wait ,"
said he to his apprentice , `` I will soon show thee how we make skins soft ,"
and he brought a strap and gave him a couple of strokes across the back.
He called them all sluggards.
Someone was building a new house , so he hurried to the window to look on.
`` There , they are using that red sand-stone again that never dries !"
cried he.
I shall live to see that house tumble down on the people who are in it"
He stumbled on the carpenters.
`` What 's this ?"
When he was setting himself to work again , the apprentice reached him a shoe.
`` Well , what 's that again ?"
`` Master ,"
An angel from heaven , however , would never make you believe that"
One night Master Pfriem dreamed he was dead , and on his way to heaven.
When he got there , he knocked loudly at the door.
`` I wonder ,"
The apostle Peter opened the door , and wanted to see who demanded admission so noisily.
`` Ah , it 's you , Master Pfriem ;"
`` You might have spared your warning ,"
answered Pfriem.
So he went in , and walked up and down the wide expanses of heaven.
Then he saw two angels who were carrying away a beam.
They did not , however , carry the beam lengthways , but obliquely.
`` Did any one ever see such a piece of stupidity ?"
thought Master Pfriem ; but he said nothing , and seemed satisfied with it.
They were watering the earth with rain.
`` Hang it ,"
he exclaimed ; but happily recollected himself , and thought , `` Perhaps it is only a pastime.
He went farther and saw a cart which had stuck fast in a deep hole.
`` It 's no wonder ,"
`` Good wishes ,"
In fact an angel did come and harnessed two horses to it.
`` That 's quite right ,"
That was too much for Master Pfriem , `` Clumsy creature ,"
At this moment Master Pfriem awoke.
`` Things are certainly arranged in heaven otherwise than they are on earth ,"
It is a lucky thing for me though , that I am not really dead"
Moreover , he never complained , but was contented with everything , and always merry.
`` Yes , my good fellow ,"
`` Why should I be sad ?"
answered the servant ; `` I have enough ; three years ' wages are jingling in my pocket"
`` How much is your treasure ?"
the dwarf asked him.
`` How much ? Three farthings sterling , all told"
`` Look here ,"
`` Aha ?"
`` All that shall you have ,"
`` Heart alive ! What can one desire more ?"
said the servant to himself , and went merrily onwards.
`` Good heavens ,"
`` If that is all ,"
said the servant , `` the bird shall soon be down here ;"
And taking aim he pulled the trigger , and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes.
`` Go , you rogue ,"
he said to the Jew , `` and fetch the bird out for yourself !"
`` Oh !"
I will get the bird out for myself , as you really have hit it"
Then he lay down on the ground , and began to crawl into the thicket.
`` Oh dear ,"
`` If you are so liberal ,"
and having taken the purse he went his way.
and went on abusing him as fast as he could speak.
`` My lord judge ,"
`` Was it a soldier ,"
said the judge , `` who cut you thus with his sabre ?"
`` Nothing of the sort !"
`` Heaven defend us !"
cried the Jew , `` his lies are as thick as flies upon the wall"
`` Yes , if you do not ask your life ,"
said the judge.
`` I do not ask for life ,"
answered the servant , `` but as a last favor let me play once more upon my fiddle"
Then the Jew cried , `` Oh ! woe 's me ! tie me , tie me fast !"
while the good servant took his fiddle from his neck , and made ready.
`` I stole it , I stole it !"
cried he ; `` but you have honestly earned it"
So the judge had the Jew taken to the gallows and hanged as a thief"
In the Garden of Paradise , beneath the Tree of Knowledge , bloomed a rose bush.
The bird flutters round us , swift as light , beauteous in color , charming in song.
But the Phoenix is not the bird of Arabia alone.
and at the minstrels ' feast he fluttered through the halls of the Wartburg.
Hear what the Moon told me.
The father and mother slept , but the little son was not asleep.
I saw the flowered cotton curtains of the bed move , and the child peep forth.
There he stood.
The thread flew from the wheel , and the wheel whirled faster and faster.
I kissed his fair hair and his blue eyes , it was such a pretty picture.
`` At that moment the mother awoke.
` Why , that is Bertel , ' said he.
And my eye quitted the poor room , for I have so much to see.
I shone upon the group of the Laocoon ; the stone seemed to sigh.
But my rays lingered longest about the Nile group with the colossal god.
`` Years have passed since all this happened ,"
the Moon went on to say.
`` Yesterday I looked upon a bay on the eastern coast of Denmark.
He had blue eyes and long white hair.
The wheel of time has turned , and new gods have come forth from the stone.
From the boats there arose a shout : ` Hurrah , hurrah for Bertel Thorwaldsen ! '"
What will the next thing be ? It is wonderful !"
`` Yes , certainly ,"
said the person_0.
`` It 's extraordinary -- that 's what I always say ,"
`` It is wonderful what a number of things can come out of me.
It 's quite incredible.
`` There you are right ,"
It is the pen that writes.
`` You have but little experience ,"
replied the person_0.
`` You 've hardly been in service a week , and are already half worn out.
I know the quill as well as the steel pen.
I should like to know what will be the next thing he 'll take out of me"
`` Inkpot !"
exclaimed the Pen.
Late in the evening the poet came home.
It seemed as though not only the strings sounded , but every part of the instrument.
Yes , that is what the poet wrote down.
He wrote it in the form of a parable , which he called `` The Master and the Instruments"
`` That is what you get , madam ,"
said the Pen to the person_0 , when the two were alone again.
`` Did you not hear him read aloud what I have written down ?"
`` Yes , what I gave you to write ,"
retorted the person_0.
`` That was a cut at you , because of your conceit.
`` Ink-pipkin !"
cried the Pen.
`` Writing-stick !"
cried the person_0.
But the poet did not sleep.
He understood his own heart in these thoughts , and caught a ray from the Eternal Master.
To _ Him _ be all the honor !"
A soldier who is afraid of nothing , troubles himself about nothing.
`` I see thou hast good boots on , which are well blacked ,"
`` I do n't know that myself ,"
answered the huntsman , `` I have lost my way in the forest"
`` Then thou art in the same plight as I ,"
The huntsman smiled a little , and they walked on further and further , until night fell.
`` We do not get out of the forest ,"
They found a stone house , knocked at the door , and an old woman opened it.
`` We are looking for quarters for the night ,"
`` You can not stay here ,"
`` It wo n't be so bad as that ,"
I shall go in"
The huntsman would not follow , but the soldier drew him in with him by the sleeve.
`` Come , my dear brother , we shall not come to an end so quickly as that !"
`` Thou wilt bring us to destruction ,"
said the huntsman , and held him back by the arm.
But the soldier began to cough loudly.
`` Aha , gentlemen , are you in the corner ?"
`` But do be civil ,"
`` We shall see ,"
`` Brother Brightboots , come and eat ,"
but the huntsman would not eat.
The robbers looked at the soldier in astonishment , and said , `` The rascal uses no ceremony"
and then he drank a hearty draught.
Come , eat and drink"
The huntsman , however , took one of the men aside and gave him another commission besides.
`` Brother Bright-boots ,"
Then he saw that the entire body-guard was coming up.
`` What can this mean ?"
said he to the huntsman.
`` Dost thou not know ?"
`` But where is the King ?"
said the soldier , `` I do not see him"
`` Here he is ,"
answered the huntsman , `` I am the King , and have announced my arrival"
Then he opened his hunting-coat , and his royal garments were visible.
Thou shalt never again be in want , I will take care of thee.
But if thou wouldst drink a health , thou must first ask my permission"
The woman said , `` And we can not call him anything else but Hans the person_0"
So a little straw was put behind the stove , and Hans the person_0 was laid on it.
His mother could not suckle him , for he would have pricked her with his quills.
He did not die , however , but remained lying there.
`` A little meat and a couple of white rolls which are wanted for the house ,"
said she.
At last he said also , `` And what wilt thou have , Hans my person_0 ?"
`` Dear father ,"
he said , `` do bring me bagpipes"
Once a King came traveling by who had lost his way and heard the music.
The King said , `` Yes ,"
and wrote a promise to Hans the person_0 that he should have this.
When he got to the courtyard , there were great rejoicings.
She asked him where in the world he had been so long.
Hans the person_0 rode away to the first kingdom.
`` That is the reward of your falseness ,"
said he , `` go your way , I will not have you !"
My tale is done , And away it has run To little August 's house"
The boy called , `` Thief ! thief ! rascal !"
with all the strength of his body.
But what good did that do ? The hawk did not bring its prey back again.
But he was very much mistaken.
These also the boy had to take to him with a letter.
The judge , however , again made him give an explanation about the missing bunches.
`` Ah ,"
`` I will soon show thee the difference ,"
The next day he set him a hard task.
The boy seated himself on the bench , and began to work with all his might.
He became aware of the misfortune too late ; there was no repairing it.
`` Ah ,"
Rather than that I will take my own life"
`` I do not know ,"
said he , `` folks say death is bitter , but it tastes very sweet to me.
It is no wonder that the farmer 's wife has so often longed for death"
He seated himself in a little chair , and was prepared to die.
But instead of becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing food.
`` It can not have been poison ,"
It was , however , no poison for flies , but Hungarian wine.
The boy got out the bottle , and emptied it.
`` This death tastes sweet too ,"
`` I feel that I must die ,"
said he , `` I will go away to the churchyard , and seek a grave"
He staggered out , reached the churchyard , and laid himself in a newly dug grave.
He lost his senses more and more.
He sought a way out , but could find none.
`` Good woman ,"
said he to her , `` Can you not show me the way through the forest ?"
`` Oh , yes , Lord King ,"
`` What kind of condition is it ?"
asked the King.
`` I have a daughter ,"
When he threw it down before him , it unrolled itself and showed him his path.
`` Where are thy brothers ?"
asked the King.
`` Alas , dear father ,"
she answered , `` they have gone away and left me alone !"
The poor girl thought , `` I can no longer stay here.
I will go and seek my brothers"
And when night came , she ran away , and went straight into the forest.
`` Here canst thou not abide ,"
they said to her.
`` But can you not protect me ?"
asked the little sister.
`` No ,"
The little sister wept and said , `` Can you not be set free ?"
`` Alas , no ,"
And if one single word falls from thy lips , all thy work will be lost"
Next morning she went out and gathered starwort and began to sew.
They called to her and said , `` Who art thou ?"
But she made no answer.
`` Come down to us ,"
said they.
`` We will not do thee any harm"
She only shook her head.
The King asked , `` Who art thou ? What art thou doing on the tree ?"
But she did not answer.
And after some days he united himself to her.
`` Who knows ,"
Then she went to the King and accused the Queen of being a man-eater.
She , however , sat continually sewing at the shirts , and cared for nothing else.
The six shirts were ready , only the left sleeve of the sixth was wanting.
Then she saw that her deliverance was near , and her heart leapt with joy.
But the King and the Queen with their six brothers lived many years in happiness and peace"
When the young folks went to the bed-room there stood a stone image of St.
Then the stone image of St.
Then they both went into the sleeping-room , and there stood a still larger stone image of St.
Then the great stone image of St.
Christopher than the two first had been.
The King 's daughter said to it , `` When my father calls , do thou answer"
Then the great tall stone image of St.
And the King 's son laid himself down on the threshold of the door and slept.
Then he gave him a glass axe , a glass wedge , and a glass mallet.
`` No ,"
Then the youngest was forced to go and take him something to eat.
When she got into the forest , she asked him how he was getting on ? `` Oh ,"
said he , `` I am getting on very badly"
Then she said he was to come and just eat a little.
`` Nay ,"
Then she took her white handkerchief again and said , `` Earth-workers , go home"
On this they all disappeared.
`` Yes ,"
said the King 's son.
So he asked what it was to be , then ? `` I have a great fish-pond ,"
said the King.
Then he was much troubled.
`` My tools have broken to pieces again"
`` Oh ,"
`` No ,"
said he , `` I can not eat , I am far too unhappy for that !"
Then she gave him many good words until at last he came and ate something.
Then they returned to her and said , `` We have done as thou hast commanded"
Then they all went away.
When the King 's son awoke the fish-pond was done.
When he arrived at the house the King asked , `` Hast thou got the fish-pond done ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the King 's son.
That was very good.
`` What is that , then ?"
asked the King 's son.
When it was mid-day she came and brought him something to eat.
Then came once again numbers of earth-men , and asked what her desire was.
on which they all disappeared.
When it had struck six , they went home together.
Then said the King , `` Is the castle ready ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the King 's son.
But he went by night to the King 's daughter and ran away with her.
`` Oh ,"
So he listened to the sermon , and then went home again.
`` Thou shouldst just have brought the priest ,"
said his wife , `` and then the church would soon have come.
It is no use to send thee , I must go there myself"
She wanted to catch the fish , but she could not.
Then she cried , `` I see very well that nothing can be done now ,"
and said that now they might come back to her.
So the young folks went once more away together.
Then they harnessed the horses at once , and many attendants seated themselves outside the carriage.
Then she and all with her looked at the maid , but no one knew her.
So a long time passed by during which the maiden served the miller honorably and faithfully.
When the bride came , they were at once to be married.
And many people hurried together , all of whom wanted to see everything.
So the miller said , `` Yes , do go there"
She put it on , and went into the church and stood by the altar.
No , she would not sell it , but the bride might perhaps earn it.
So the bride said , `` Yes , she was willing to do that"
Then he wanted to go to her , but his mother had locked the door.
But the false mother and the bride had to depart.
And the mouth of the person who last told all this is still warm"
There was once on a time a Queen to whom God had given no children.
Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink , and die of hunger.
Then the wicked wretch came in and said , `` Where are the boy 's heart and tongue ?"
`` Ah ,"
Then he went away to his own country , and the poodle had to run after him.
She answered , `` I have just eaten , and am still satisfied ,"
for she thought the angels were there.
He replied , `` Lord King , your majesty must excuse me , I am a poor huntsman"
But the King insisted on it , and said , `` Thou shalt sit by me ,"
until he did it.
Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar , and said , `` That is the wretch !"
The King replied , `` Yes , I would like to see her"
Then the son said , `` Now will I show her to you in her own form ,"
These were a couple of enormous balls , and nine-pins as tall as a man.
`` Little worm ,"
`` What dost thou want with it ?"
said the King 's son.
`` I do not want the apple for myself ,"
answered the giant , `` but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it.
I have traveled far about the world and can not find the tree"
`` I will soon find it ,"
`` They will be sure to let me in ,"
said the King 's son.
`` That luck will be mine ,"
said the King 's son.
The beasts lay round about it , but they had put their heads down and were asleep.
The giant said , `` I have nothing to do but go home and fetch it ,"
He therefore demanded the ring from him , but the King 's son refused it.
`` Where the apple is , the ring must be also ,"
We will bathe in the river , and cool ourselves before we begin again"
`` Is there no way , then , of destroying a weak child of man like that ?"
And it came to pass that he arrived before a castle which was enchanted.
`` What shall I do ?"
said the King 's son.
Thy life they dare not take"
`` Wait , you fellow behind the stove , I am coming ,"
said another.
The screaming became still louder , so that no one could have heard it without terror.
She said , `` Thou hast held out successfully for one night , but two more lie before thee"
The next night the devils came and began their gambols anew.
And now he had only one night more to go through , but it was the worst.
The hob-goblins came again : `` Art thou there still ?"
cried they , `` thou shalt be tormented till thy breath stops"
`` Rise ,"
`` What am I to do ,"
asked he.
For three days I will come every afternoon at two o'clock in a carriage.
`` No ,"
said the man , `` I will not eat or drink"
Then he let himself be persuaded , and drank.
She went to him , but there he lay sleeping , and there was no wakening him.
When she came to him , there he was lying fast asleep.
She shook him and called him , but she could not waken him.
At length he ventured it and went in.
`` I 'd rather you would leave that alone ,"
`` If that be true ,"
`` This pleases me well ,"
said the giant , and ate to his heart 's content.
`` It 's no matter !"
But there , too , it was in vain.
When the brother came home they inquired about the golden castle of Stromberg.
He replied , `` When I have eaten and have had enough , I will look in the map"
`` How am I to get there ?"
asked the man.
So he again cried , `` God be with ye !"
Then he cried for the third time , `` God be with ye ,"
and thought , `` I must see what these three are about ,"
and went thither and asked why they were beating each other so furiously.
Then the man said , `` I will give you something in exchange for these three things.
Then he struck the door with his stick , and it sprang open immediately.
She , however , could not see him because he had the mantle on.
When they came to the door , they saw him and cried aloud in their delight.
`` Very well ,"
said the father , `` I am quite content with that ,"
and gave him some money for his journey.
So he traveled about and looked for work.
said the huntsman , `` if thou wilt go with me"
Towards midnight , it seemed to him as if a tiny little light glimmered in the distance.
`` Well , really ,"
said the giant , `` if the wind has not blown the bit out of my hand !"
and helped himself to another.
`` I have not snatched it away ,"
said the other , `` a sharpshooter must have shot it away from thee"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` I will soon get her for you"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` that will be a little bit of fun for me"
But when the King in the castle awoke , he saw the three giants lying there dead.
Then the old King said that as he had accomplished this , he should marry his daughter.
He said , `` No ,"
she must first pay for the things she had already had.
The huntsman heard it likewise , and thought to himself , `` That would suit thee.
Thou art poor , and hast no money"
He was charmed with the beautiful maiden , who was indeed as lovely as any picture.
He asked her if she were the King 's daughter.
`` Yes ,"
answered she.
`` With this sword ,"
said he , `` did I cut off the heads of three giants"
And he took their tongues out of his knapsack in proof.
Hereupon she was overjoyed , and said that he was the one who had delivered her.
The captain said , `` Then they can not have had any"
`` Not so ,"
said the King.
`` Every animal has a tongue ,"
`` Eh ! what ?"
said the man.
`` You are not very sharp.
If he has served us , he has had good feeding for it"
`` Hark ye , gossip ,"
said the wolf , `` be of good cheer , I will help you out of your trouble.
I have thought of something.
Then I will come out of the wood , and carry off the child.
You must rush swiftly after me , as if you would seize it again from me.
The plan pleased the dog , and it was carried out just as it was arranged.
Henceforth Old Sultan was as well off as he could wish to be.
Soon afterwards the wolf visited him , and was pleased that everything had succeeded so well.
`` But , gossip ,"
`` Do not reckon upon that ,"
answered the dog ; `` I will remain true to my master ; I can not agree to that"
`` Thou hast misled me finely ,"
The fox replied , `` Why art thou such a glutton ?"
`` There is something for thee to eat ,"
said he to him , and then went his way.
and went thither and tore the whole dish down so that it broke in pieces.
`` How abominably thou hast misled me !"
cried he , `` the peasants caught me , and tanned my skin for me"
But the fox replied , `` Why art thou such a glutton ?"
`` I am willing ,"
`` I must see that no one is coming ,"
replied the crafty fellow.
`` Do n't eat too much !"
Then said the wolf , `` I shall not leave until the barrel is empty"
When the fox saw him he was out of the hole at one bound.
Then the clerk got behind the altar , and said , `` Thieving , thieving"
So he goes with his son to seek a man who is acquainted with thieving.
Hans says , `` Do you know of a man who is acquainted with thieving ?"
`` You can learn that here quite well ,"
says the woman , `` my son is a master of it"
The father goes home again , and the son learns witchcraft and thieving , thoroughly.
`` Oh ,"
`` Hollo , my son , art thou here ?"
`` Father , let us go ,"
said the youth.
Then the father and son set out homeward.
On the way a carriage comes driving by.
Then the gentleman calls from the carriage , `` My man , will you sell your dog ?"
`` Yes ,"
says the father.
`` How much do you want for it ?"
`` Thirty thalers"
They go home together.
So the man goes home with the horse , and puts it in the stable.
Then the maid stands still , and says , `` What , canst thou speak ?"
There were once two brothers , the one rich , the other poor.
So he went up to it and said , `` Semsi mountain , Semsi mountain , open ,"
and the mountain opened to him also.
When he came out again he also said , `` Semsi mountain , Semsi mountain , shut thyself ;"
and the mountain closed itself , and he went home with his barrow.
`` Corn and barley ,"
said the other.
The poor man then told him everything , just as it happened.
When he came to the mountain he cried , `` Semsi mountain , Semsi mountain , open"
The mountain opened , and he went inside it.
At length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry.
Then he cried , `` It was not I , it was my brother ,"
but let him beg for his life and say what he would , they cut his head off"
Peter , and asked him to give them shelter for the night.
Thereupon person_0.
`` Oh ,"
said he , `` do you want to win the three groschen too ?"
On this they would not let him go.
So he went in , and played away the three groschen also.
Meanwhile person_0.
person_0.
Early next day our Lord told Gambling Hansel that he might beg three favors.
The Lord gave him all that he had asked , and departed with person_0.
Peter.
Upon this person_0.
We must send Death to him"
So person_0.
Peter said to the Lord , `` Lord , this thing must not go on.
People no longer die ; we must go ourselves"
And they went themselves , and the Lord commanded Hansel to let Death come down.
So Hansel went at once to Death and said to him , `` Come down ,"
and Death took him directly and put an end to him.
`` Who is there ?"
`` Gambling Hansel"
`` Ah , we will have nothing to do with him ! Begone !"
So he went to the door of Purgatory , and knocked once more.
`` Who is there ?"
`` Gambling Hansel"
`` Ah , there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him.
We do not want to gamble , just go away again"
Then he went to the door of Hell , and there they let him in.
And no sooner was Hansel there than he sat down to gamble again.
So again person_0.
And they let him in.
Therefore person_0.
`` Never ,"
answered the person_0 ; `` if you were to go , it would be going to your death"
The prince answered , `` What can I do with such a great big man ?"
`` Oh ,"
`` If that 's the case ,"
said the prince , `` I can make use of thee , come with me"
`` What art thou doing there ?"
asked the person_0 's son.
`` I am listening ,"
replied the man.
`` What art thou listening to so attentively ?"
`` Tell me ,"
The person_0 's son said , `` I can make use of thee , come with me"
`` Why ,"
said the prince , `` what a tall rascal thou art !"
`` Oh ,"
I will gladly enter your service , if you will take me"
`` Come with me ,"
said the prince , `` I can make use of thee"
They went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes.
`` No ,"
If you can use that , I shall be glad to serve you"
`` Come with me ,"
replied the person_0 's son , `` I can make use of thee"
`` How canst thou shiver when the sun is shining so warm ?"
said the person_0 's son.
`` Alack ,"
replied the man , `` I am of quite a different nature.
`` Thou art a strange fellow ,"
said the prince , `` but if thou wilt enter my service , follow me"
`` What art thou looking at so eagerly ?"
said the person_0 's son.
`` What is the first to be ?"
`` Thou shalt fetch me my ring which I have dropped into the Red Sea"
A ring is to be got out of the Red Sea.
Come , find some way of doing it"
Then the man with the sharp sight said , `` I will see where it is lying ,"
and looked down into the water and said , `` It is sticking there , on a pointed stone"
`` Oh , is that all !"
The Tall One stooped down a little , and brought out the ring with his hand.
She was astonished , and said , `` Yes , it is the right ring.
Thou hast safely performed the first task , but now comes the second.
`` May I invite no guests to this repast ?"
inquired the prince , `` no dinner is good without some company"
The prince thought , `` The task is easy , I will most certainly keep my eyes open"
`` Oh , misery and misfortune !"
cried the prince , `` now I am lost !"
`` Yes ,"
for she believed that her daughter was on the rock three hundred leagues off.
She dared not make any opposition , and was forced to give him her daughter.
On this the proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger , and she meditated revenge.
and they put him in the middle of the pile , and set fire to it.
But the Listener had sharpened his ears , and heard the secret discourse of the old woman.
`` What shall we do ?"
said he to the Stout One.
We two shall have to set to work also , and help him"
And now came a couple of people who asked if she knew who her husband was.
`` Yes ,"
But they said , `` Just come with us , and we will take you to him ,"
He had routed them all and cut off the head of the chief monster.
This brave warrior was always followed by a band of faithful knights.
In this band there were five knights of great valor.
`` Then do you disbelieve what I say , and think that I am telling you a falsehood ?"
`` No , I do not think that you are telling a lie ,"
said Watanabe ; `` but you have heard some old woman 's story which is not worth believing"
said Hojo.
`` I will take this ,"
and he mounted his horse and rode off gallantly.
`` It is just as I thought ,"
Then his helmet was seized from the back.
`` Who are you ?"
said Watanabe fearlessly.
The ogre thought to terrify his foe , but Watanabe never flinched.
As he did so he stumbled upon something lying on the ground.
So he took it up carefully and carried it home as a trophy of his victory.
Watanabe therefore had a box made of the strongest wood and banded with iron.
Now one night he heard some one knocking at the porch , asking for admittance.
If the lord of the house were at home she begged to be allowed to see him.
He ordered the servant to show her in.
`` I was very disappointed ,"
`` I am very proud to think ,"
There is nothing that can be compared to your courage.
Before I die it is the great wish of my life to see this arm ,"
she added pleadingly.
`` No ,"
said Watanabe , `` I am sorry , but I can not grant your request"
`` But why ?"
asked the old woman.
`` Because ,"
`` Your precaution is very reasonable ,"
said the old woman.
Watanabe was very troubled at the old woman 's pleading , but he still persisted in refusing.
answered Watanabe.
`` Then you can not surely refuse to show me the arm any longer"
Come , follow me !"
and he led the way to his own room , the old woman following.
`` What is it like ? Let me have a good look at it ,"
said the old nurse , with a joyful face.
So quick was Watanabe that the creature had a narrow escape.
In this way the ogre escaped with his arm.
The knight gnashed his teeth with disappointment , but that was all he could do.
He waited in patience for another opportunity to dispatch the ogre.
I will tell you a story which was told to me when I was a little boy.
The baking-oven sticks out of the wall like a little fat body.
There is a yard-dog too , who barks at all comers.
But what might this _ something _ be ? `` You 'll know that best , old man ,"
said the wife.
Ride to the fair"
Yes , the old man knew what he was about.
The sun shone hotly down , and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky.
There was no shelter anywhere from the sunbeams.
Among the rest , a man was trudging along , and driving a cow to the fair.
The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow can be.
`` She gives good milk , I 'm sure ,"
said the peasant.
`` That would be a very good exchange -- the cow for the horse.
`` Hallo , you there with the cow !"
If you like , we 'll exchange"
`` To be sure I will ,"
said the man ; and they exchanged accordingly.
It was a good fat sheep , with a fine fleece on its back.
`` I should like to have that fellow ,"
said our peasant to himself.
Perhaps it would be more practical to have a sheep instead of a cow.
Shall we exchange ?"
The man with the sheep was quite ready , and the bargain was struck.
So our peasant went on in the high-road with his sheep.
`` That 's a heavy thing you have there.
By this time he was very near the town.
This fowl had short tail-feathers , and winked with both its eyes , and looked very cunning.
`` Cluck , cluck !"
said the fowl.
On my word , I should like to have that fowl.
A fowl can always find a grain or two , and can almost keep itself.
I think it would be a good exchange if I could get that for my goose.
`` Shall we exchange ?"
he asked the toll-taker.
`` Exchange !"
repeated the man ; `` well , that would not be a bad thing"
The hostler was carrying a sack.
`` What have you in that sack ?"
asked the peasant.
`` Rotten apples ,"
answered the hostler ; `` a whole sackful of them -- enough to feed the pigs with"
-LRB- Illustration : THE OLD MAN RELATES HIS SUCCESS.
Yes , I shall be glad to show them to her"
`` What will you give me for the sackful ?"
asked the hostler.
`` What will I give ? I will give my fowl in exchange"
And he gave the fowl accordingly , and received the apples , which he carried into the guest-room.
He leaned the sack carefully by the stove , and then went to the table.
But the stove was hot : he had not thought of that.
`` Why , do you know -- ,"
said our peasant.
`` Well , your old woman will give it you well when you get home !"
said one of the two Englishmen.
`` There will be a disturbance"
`` What ? -- give me what ?"
said the peasant.
'"
`` Shall we wager ?"
said the Englishman.
`` We 'll wager coined gold by the ton -- a hundred pounds to the hundredweight !"
`` A bushel will be enough ,"
replied the peasant.
`` Done -- taken !"
And the bet was made.
`` Good evening , old woman"
`` Good evening , old man"
`` I 've made the exchange"
`` Yes , you understand what you 're about ,"
said the woman.
`` I got a cow in exchange for the horse ,"
said he.
`` Heaven be thanked !"
said she.
`` Yes , but I changed the cow for a sheep"
`` Ah , that 's better still !"
cried the wife.
`` You always think of everything : we have just pasture enough for a sheep.
How you think of everything !"
`` But I changed away the sheep for a goose"
`` Then this year we shall really have roast goose to eat , my dear old man.
You are always thinking of something to give me pleasure.
`` But I gave away the goose for a fowl ,"
said the man.
`` A fowl ? That was a good exchange !"
replied the woman.
`` Yes , but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shrivelled apples"
`` What ! -- I must positively kiss you for that ,"
exclaimed the wife.
`` My dear , good husband ! Now , I 'll tell you something.
I thought it should be pancakes with savoury herbs.
I had eggs , and bacon too ; but I wanted herbs.
I begged her to lend me a handful of herbs.
I could not even lend you a shrivelled apple , my dear woman.
' But now _ I _ can lend _ her _ ten , or a whole sackful.
That I 'm very glad of ; that makes me laugh !"
And with that she gave him a sounding kiss.
`` I like that !"
exclaimed both the Englishmen together.
`` Always going down-hill , and always merry ; that 's worth the money"
So they paid a hundredweight of gold to the peasant , who was not scolded , but kissed.
You see , that is my story.
There they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their grief.
The eldest said , `` I will manage to find it ,"
`` No ,"
said the King , `` the danger of it is too great.
I would rather die"
But he begged so long that the King consented.
`` Silly shrimp ,"
said the prince , very haughtily , `` it is nothing to do with you ,"
and rode on.
But the little dwarf had grown angry , and had wished an evil wish.
The sick King waited long for him , but he came not.
Then the second son said , `` Father , let me go forth to seek the water ,"
and thought to himself , `` If my brother is dead , then the kingdom will fall to me"
said the prince , `` that is nothing to thee ,"
and rode on without giving him another look.
So fare haughty people.
`` Dost thou know , then , where that is to be found ?"
`` No ,"
said the prince.
The prince thanked him , took the wand and the bread , and set out on his way.
When he arrived , everything was as the dwarf had said.
A sword and a loaf of bread were lying there , which he carried away.
So he lay down and fell asleep.
When he awoke , it was striking a quarter to twelve.
`` They are imprisoned between two mountains ,"
said the dwarf.
`` I have condemned them to stay there , because they were so haughty"
The prince then took back his loaf and his sword , and the three brothers rode on.
They then began to seek revenge , and plotted with each other to destroy him.
The old King was angry with his youngest son , and thought he had plotted against his life.
The huntsman said , `` I can not tell you , and yet I ought"
Then the prince said , `` Say openly what it is , I will pardon you"
`` Alas !"
The old King then thought , `` Can my son have been innocent ?"
`` He still lives ,"
said the huntsman , `` I could not find it in my heart to carry out your command ,"
and told the King how it had happened.
The woman stayed many years with the robbers , and person_0 grew tall and strong.
His mother stood in a corner full of admiration of his bravery and strength.
`` Dear person_0 ,"
answered the mother , `` come , we will go and seek him until we find him"
He stood there and wondered at everything just as if he had not been very wise.
The father was sitting in the doorway.
`` God save us !"
cried the father , `` what 's that ? Now thou hast broken our little house to pieces !"
`` Do n't grow any gray hairs about that , dear father ,"
answered person_0 ; `` there , in that sack , is more than is wanting for a new house"
`` Hollo !"
cried person_0 , `` what art thou doing up there ?"
the fellow replied , `` I got some faggots together yesterday and am twisting a rope for them"
`` That is what I like ,"
thought person_0 , `` he has some strength ,"
and he called to him , `` Leave that alone , and come with me"
`` Thy name is now Fir-twister ,"
said person_0 to him.
`` Oh , indeed ,"
thought person_0 , `` I can make use of this one also ;"
The next morning person_0 went into the garden.
It had run quite wild , and was full of thorns and bushes.
Fir-twister stayed at home the first , and person_0 and Rock-splitter went out hunting.
`` Be off , sly hypocrite ,"
he answered , `` thou needest no meat"
and the mere thought of that gave him pleasure already.
and handed him a bit.
But the dwarf begged again for the third time.
`` Thou art shameless !"
said person_0 , and gave him none.
When he rose up again , the dwarf had got the start of him.
person_0 now went home , but he had marked the spot.
When the two others came back , they were surprised that person_0 was so well.
and gave him such a blow with his club that he fell down dead.
Immediately the chains fell from the maiden , and person_0 was enraptured with her beauty.
`` It is indeed sad ,"
said he to himself , `` that I have to waste away down here ,"
They obeyed instantly , and it was just as if he had flown up himself.
When , however , he was above again , he found no one in sight.
Fir-twister and Rock-splitter had hurried away , and had taken the beautiful maiden with them.
Beware of opening it , or thou wilt bring misery on thyself"
Each day she opened one of them , until she had made the round of the twelve.
`` Oh no ,"
said the little angels , `` that would be a sin.
The Virgin Mary has forbidden it , and it might easily cause thy unhappiness"
If I do it , no one will ever know"
Then the door sprang open , and she saw there the Trinity sitting in fire and splendor.
Immediately a great fear fell on her.
She shut the door violently , and ran away.
It was not long before the Virgin Mary came back from her journey.
She called the girl before her , and asked to have the keys of heaven back.
`` No ,"
she replied.
Then she said once again , `` Art thou certain that thou hast not done it ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the girl , for the second time.
`` No ,"
said the girl for the third time.
She wanted to cry out , but she could bring forth no sound.
Into this she crept when night came , and here she slept.
Thus she sat year after year , and felt the pain and the misery of the world.
But she gave no answer , for she could not open her mouth.
The King continued , `` Wilt thou go with me to my castle ?"
Then she just nodded her head a little.
After a year or so had passed , the Queen brought a son into the world.
and the Virgin Mary took the new-born child from her arms , and vanished with it.
Then the Queen again said , `` No , I did not open the forbidden door ;"
and the Virgin took the child out of her arms , and away with her to heaven.
But for the third time the Queen answered , `` No , I did not open the forbidden door"
She must be judged ,"
and the King was no longer able to restrain his councillors.
`` Perhaps some accident has befallen him ,"
The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest.
They bound him with cords , and led him away to the castle.
And from this time forth every one could again go into the forest with safety.
The boy ran thither and said , `` Give me my ball out"
`` Not till thou hast opened the door for me ,"
answered the man.
`` No ,"
said the boy , `` I will not do that ; the King has forbidden it ,"
and ran away.
but the boy would not.
The door opened with difficulty , and the boy pinched his fingers.
She called the boy , but no one answered.
Then he could easily guess what had happened , and much grief reigned in the royal court.
If thou dost all I bid thee , thou shalt fare well.
Of treasure and gold have I enough , and more than anyone in the world"
I will come every evening to see if thou hast obeyed my order"
`` Nothing , nothing ,"
he answered , and held his finger behind his back , that the man might not see it.
By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it.
He took it quickly out , but it was already quite gilded.
Iron John came , and already knew what had happened.
`` Thou hast let a hair fall into the well ,"
said he.
When he came he already knew everything , and said , `` Take the handkerchief off"
`` Thou hast not stood the trial , and canst stay here no longer.
Go forth into the world , there thou wilt learn what poverty is.
My power is great , greater than thou thinkest , and I have gold and silver in abundance"
At length he went to the palace , and asked if they would take him in.
He put his cap on with all haste , and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together.
`` Oh , no ,"
replied the boy , `` the wild ones have more scent , and will please her better"
He again said , `` I may not , I have a sore head"
With these he departed , but he cared nothing for the gold pieces.
Not long afterwards , the country was overrun by war.
When he came to the outskirts , he called `` Iron John ,"
three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees.
Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately , and said , `` What dost thou desire ?"
`` I want a strong steed , for I am going to the wars"
`` That thou shalt have , and still more than thou askest for"
`` What dost thou desire ?"
asked the wild man.
`` Take back thy horse and thy troops , and give me my three-legged horse again"
All that he asked was done , and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse.
`` I am not the one who carried away the victory ,"
said he , `` but a stranger knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers"
They asked , too , `` Under what hedge hast thou been lying sleeping all the time ?"
And then he was still more ridiculed"
Perhaps the unknown will come to it"
When the feast was announced , the youth went out to the forest , and called Iron John.
`` What dost thou desire ?"
asked he.
`` That I may catch the King 's daughter 's golden apple"
`` It is as safe as if thou hadst it already ,"
said Iron John.
They rode back and announced this to the King.
The following day the King 's daughter asked the gardener about his boy.
asked the King.
`` Yes ,"
answered he , `` and here the apples are ,"
and he took them out of his pocket , and returned them to the King.
But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies"
`` My father is a mighty King , and gold have I in plenty as great as I require"
`` I well see ,"
`` Yes ,"
answered he , `` that indeed you can.
Give me your daughter to wife"
and then she went and kissed him.
`` That 's right , my son ,"
It was , however , just dished up , and the dish stood on the hearth.
Then he said , `` Mother , what is there to eat to-day ?"
`` See for thyself ,"
said his mother.
`` Mistress , if you give us no better food ,"
Potato-King.
'"
`` What wouldst thou have forsooth , grasshopper ?"
`` Ho , ho , lady mistress ,"
At last , however , she caught him and drove him out of the house.
`` Hollo ,"
Thumbling reflected a while , and at length he said , `` yes ,"
and went with them to the treasure-chamber.
It was not long before he espied one which was broad enough to let him in.
`` Let the poor creature alone ,"
said the other ; `` it has done thee no harm"
The robbers paid him great compliments.
`` Thou art a valiant hero ,"
said they ; `` wilt thou be our captain ?"
Thumbling , however , declined , and said he wanted to see the world first.
Then said they , `` Wait , and we will pay thee off !"
and arranged with each other to play him a trick.
Now amongst them there was a great black one , who swallowed him down without hurting him.
But the noise of the milking prevented his being understood.
The master heard that quite well , but did not know from whence the voice came.
`` Where art thou ?"
asked he.
`` In the black one ,"
answered Thumbling , but the master did not understand what that meant , and went out.
Next morning the cow was killed.
No one heard this because of the noise of the chopping-knife.
But his liberty did not last long.
`` Hollo , Mr.
Fox ,"
`` Thou art right ,"
answered the fox.
`` With all my heart ,"
replied Thumbling.
`` Thou shalt have all the cocks and hens , that I promise thee"
Then the fox let him go again , and himself carried him home.
`` For this I likewise bring thee a handsome bit of money ,"
said Thumbling , and gave his father the kreuzer which he earned on his travels.
`` But why did the fox get the poor chickens to eat ?"
At that moment a very big fish jumped about in the bottom of the basket.
`` Is it a he or a she ?"
inquired the queen.
`` I wish to purchase a she fish"
On hearing this the fish laughed aloud.
`` It 's a he ,"
replied the fisherwoman , and proceeded on her rounds.
`` Are you indisposed ?"
he said.
`` No ; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behavior of a fish.
`` A fish laugh ! Impossible ! You must be dreaming"
`` I am not a fool.
I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes and have heard with my own ears"
`` Passing strange ! Be it so.
I will inquire concerning it"
The vizier promised to do his best , though he felt almost certain of failure.
For five months he labored indefatigably to find a reason for the laughter of the fish.
He sought everywhere and from every one.
The old farmer agreed , and they walked along together.
The day was hot , and the way was long and weary.
said the youth.
`` What a fool the man is !"
thought the old farmer.
`` Is this eaten or not ?"
said the young man.
Not understanding his meaning , the old man replied , `` I do n't know"
`` What a large cemetery !"
exclaimed the young man.
`` What does the man mean ,"
thought the old farmer , `` calling this largely populated city a cemetery ?"
They beckoned to the two travellers and gave them as much as they would.
`` What a splendid city this is !"
said the young man.
`` Now , the man must surely be demented !"
thought the old farmer.
However , he kept his thoughts to himself.
Presently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge of the cemetery.
`` Well ! I never did see such a perfect fool , both in word and in deed ,"
said the old man to himself.
`` Thank you very much ,"
The old farmer left him in despair , and entered his house laughing.
`` There is a man in yonder field ,"
he said , after returning their greetings.
But the fellow is such a fool that I can not make anything out of him.
He wants to know if the beam of this house is all right.
The man must be mad !"
and saying this , he burst into a fit of laughter.
`` Father ,"
He only wishes to know if you can afford to entertain him"
`` Oh ! of course ,"
replied the farmer.
`` I see.
Well perhaps you can help me to solve some of his other mysteries.
`` Most assuredly ,"
said the girl.
`` He meant that one of you should tell a story to beguile the time"
`` Oh yes.
Well , we were passing through a corn-field , when he asked me whether it was eaten or not"
`` I see ,"
said the farmer.
`` True , true !"
said the astonished farmer.
`` I admire his wisdom ,"
replied the girl.
The slightest stumble and they would fall , and be wetted from head to foot.
This friend of yours is a most wise man.
I should like to see him and speak to him"
`` Very well ,"
said the farmer ; `` I will go and find him , and bring him in"
His father foolishly complied.
`` Give your mistress my salam ,"
After a little while the young man appeared with the old farmer.
`` The laughing of the fish ,"
`` Joy , joy !"
exclaimed the vizier 's son.
The following day he hastened back to his own country , taking with him the farmer 's daughter.
Immediately on arrival he ran to the palace and informed his father of what he had heard.
`` Never !"
said the king.
`` But it must be so , Your Majesty ,"
We 'll soon find out whether there is any man there"
All of them tried , but only one succeeded.
they at last consented , and gave him the child.
They took great care of the foundling , and he grew up in all goodness.
`` No ,"
answered they , `` he 's a foundling.
`` Just as the person_0 commands ,"
answered they , and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness.
In the darkness he saw a small light ; he went towards it and reached a cottage.
When he went in , an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone.
`` I come from the mill ,"
`` You poor boy ,"
`` Let them come ,"
and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.
Soon afterwards the robbers came , and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there ? `` Ah ,"
`` How has that come to pass ?"
said he ; `` I gave quite another order in my letter"
The person_0 read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other.
`` I know nothing about it ,"
answered he ; `` it must have been changed in the night , when I slept in the forest"
In this way the person_0 hoped to be rid of him for ever.
thereupon he took leave of them and began his journey.
`` I know everything ,"
answered the luck-child.
`` Then you can do us a favor ,"
`` That you shall know ,"
answered he ; `` only wait until I come back"
`` I know everything ,"
answered he.
`` You shall know that ,"
answered he ; `` only wait until I come back"
Then he went on and came to a wide river over which he must go.
The ferryman asked him what his trade was , and what he knew.
`` I know everything ,"
answered he.
`` Then you can do me a favor ,"
`` You shall know that ,"
answered he ; `` only wait until I come back"
When he had crossed the water he found the entrance to Hell.
`` What do you want ?"
said she to him , but she did not look so very wicked.
`` I should like to have three golden hairs from the devil 's head ,"
answered he , `` else I can not keep my wife"
`` That is a good deal to ask for ,"
`` Yes ,"
`` Those are difficult questions ,"
As the evening came on , the devil returned home.
No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure.
`` I smell man 's flesh ,"
said he ; `` all is not right here"
Then he pried into every corner , and searched , but could not find anything.
His grandmother scolded him.
`` It has just been swept ,"
Sit down and eat your supper"
`` Oh !"
cried the devil , `` what are you doing ?"
`` I have had a bad dream ,"
answered the grandmother , `` so I seized hold of your hair"
`` What did you dream then ?"
said the devil.
`` Oh , ho ! if they did but know it ,"
He went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook.
Then she pulled the second hair out.
`` Ha ! what are you doing ?"
cried the devil angrily.
`` Do not take it ill ,"
said she , `` I did it in a dream"
`` What have you dreamt this time ?"
asked he.
What , think you , was the reason ?"
`` Oh ! if they did but know ,"
answered the devil.
The grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored.
Then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out.
`` What was the dream , then ?"
asked he , and was quite curious.
What is the cause of it ?"
`` Ah ! the fool ,"
`` There are the three golden hairs for you ,"
said she.
`` What the Devil said to your three questions , I suppose you heard ?"
`` Yes ,"
answered he , `` I heard , and will take care to remember"
`` You have what you want ,"
said she , `` and now you can go your way"
When he came to the ferry-man he was expected to give the promised answer.
`` Ferry me across first ,"
said the luck-child , `` and then I will tell you how you can be set free ,"
At last he came to the town whose well was dry.
The watchman thanked him , and also gave him two asses laden with gold.
`` I was rowed across a river ,"
answered he , `` and got it there ; it lies on the shore instead of sand"
`` Can I too fetch some of it ?"
said the person_0 ; and he was quite eager about it.
`` As much as you like ,"
answered he.
But from this time forth the person_0 had to ferry , as a punishment for his sins.
PAINTER in Paphos and Cythera famed Depict , I pray , the absent Iris ' face.
Thou hast not seen the lovely nymph I 've named ; The better for thy peace.
-- Then will I trace For thy instruction her transcendent grace.
Begin with lily white and blushing rose , Take then the Loves and Graces.
Thou at Cythera couldst , at Paphos too , Of the same Iris Venus form anew"
O'ercharged , howe'er , his stomach soon gave way ; And doctors were required without delay.
THE danger imminent , his friends desired He 'd settle ev ` ry thing affairs required.
Let me have your daughter with me in the palace.
I have flax enough , and there she shall spin as much as she likes"
The mother was heartily satisfied with this , and the Queen took the girl with her.
`` Now spin me this flax ,"
I care not for that , thy indefatigable industry is dowry enough"
`` With all my heart ,"
she replied , `` do but come in and begin the work at once"
`` I have three aunts ,"
The Queen and the bridegroom said , `` Why should we not allow that ?"
`` Ah ,"
said the bridegroom , `` how comest thou by these odious friends ?"
`` By treading ,"
she answered , `` by treading"
`` By licking ,"
she answered , `` by licking"
Then he asked the third , `` How do you come by your broad thumb ?"
`` By twisting the thread ,"
she answered , `` by twisting the thread"
And thus she got rid of the hateful flax-spinning"
And when harvest time came , the apples on this tree were all as red as blood.
He sought them everywhere in the palace and garden , but could not find them.
Next day , the second stayed at home , and he fared no better.
`` Oh , very badly ,"
Then he showed him a deep well , but there was no water in it.
And having said all this , the elf vanished.
Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow.
Then he said , `` If I ring , you must draw me up again immediately"
Then he took his hanger and hewed at them , and the nine fell off.
And they all rejoiced , and embraced him and kissed him without stopping.
He looked at the dragons , heads likewise and said , `` You too can not help me now"
`` Ah ! old water-splasher , is it thou ?"
said she ; `` I am weeping for my golden ball , which has fallen into the well"
`` Be quiet , and do not weep ,"
`` Whatever thou wilt have , dear frog ,"
`` Oh yes ,"
`` Wait , wait ,"
said the frog.
`` Take me with thee.
I ca n't run as thou canst"
`` Ah , no ,"
replied she.
`` It is no giant but a disgusting frog"
`` What does a frog want with thee ?"
Then said the King , `` That which thou hast promised must thou perform.
Go and let him in"
There he sat and cried , `` Lift me up beside thee"
She delayed , until at last the King commanded her to do it.
She did this , but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.
The frog enjoyed what he ate , but almost every mouthful she took choked her.
`` Now , thou wilt be quiet , odious frog ,"
said she.
He by her father 's will was now her dear companion and husband.
The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom.
So he turned round and cried , `` Henry , the carriage is breaking"
`` No , master , it is not the carriage.
`` Listen ,"
The King took the mortar , and asked if he had found nothing besides that ? `` No ,"
answered the countryman.
Then the King said that he must now bring him the pestle.
and would neither eat nor drink.
and what it was that his daughter had said.
`` If you have a daughter who is as wise as that , let her come here"
She at once said yes , she would guess it.
Then the other went away , and wept and lamented over his foal.
and then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by the King.
The next day , therefore , the peasant stood there , and fished on dry ground.
and she embraced him and kissed him , and said she would take leave of him.
He called his attendants , but none of them were there.
`` That is the King of birds ,"
said the wolf , `` before whom we must bow down"
It was , however , in reality the willow-wren -LRB- Zaunk nig -RRB-.
`` If that 's the case ,"
`` That is not done quite as you seem to think ,"
said the wolf ; `` you must wait until the Queen comes"
So they observed the hole in which was the nest , and trotted away.
`` Is that the royal palace ?"
The bear and the wolf grew uneasy , and turned back and went into their holes.
Then the old King said , `` Be easy , he shall be punished ,"
`` Good ,"
said the fox , `` but what signal shall we agree upon ?"
So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear , and begged their pardon.
SELF-TORMENTS solely parson John obtained ; By seeing her that o ` er his senses reigned.
A pleasant stratagem he now contrived , From which , he hoped , success might be derived.
THE husband promised he would hold his tongue ; And John disliked deferring matters long.
THE husband , while the holy pastor spoke , Appeared to grumble and his stars invoke.
No mare , replied the husband , I desire ; An ass for me is all that I require"
If any belle recede , and shun the sight , Dissimulation she supposes right.
With scenes like these will Cupid oft surprise , And frantick passion sparkle in his eyes.
The first attempt had clearly bad success , And fair Theresa suffered you may guess.
But now-a-days , in practice , ` tis confessed , These shopkeepers are knowing as the best.
To this he nothing offered in reply , Though oft his throbbing bosom heaved a sigh.
THE lad most gratefully his thanks returned ; His breast with ev ` ry soft emotion burned.
A confidant had been employed around , To watch if any one were lurking found.
I scarcely ought to say what now I speak , But anxiously your happiness I seek.
AWAY the silly lad with ardor flew , And left no time objections to renew.
This said , by disappointment rendered sour , The beauteous bride in anger left the bow ` r.
Soon with the carpet simple Nicaise came , And found that things no longer were the same.
Delays are dangerous , in love or war , And Nicaise is a proof they fortune mar.
.
But opportunity you ca n't discern ; To know its value , -- prithee go and learn"
Just add thereto a little honest love , And I shall be as easy as a glove.
We know them by the thinness of their face Long sleep is quite excluded from their race.
PERRETTA at the house remained to greet The lordly devil whom she hoped to cheat.
Superior understanding she possessed ; Though fond of laughter , frolick , fun , and jest.
Whichever first a favor might obtain , Should tell his happiness to t ` other swain.
ARE we not brothers in adventure , pray ? And such our solemn promises , to-day.
Since one the painter clearly has disgraced , The other equally should be embraced.
HERE ends our tale ; the business is complete ; In soft amours success alone is sweet.
Her veil was floating , and her artless dress , A shepherdess seemed clearly to express.
` Tis even said that Cupid lent supplies ; From superstition many things arise.
Two months had passed , and not a person knew Their frequent meetings , pleasure to pursue.
Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise , but all forfeited their lives.
There he met an old woman , who asked him where he was going.
`` I hardly know myself ,"
`` That is not so difficult ,"
He was as well received as the others , and royal garments were put upon him.
`` Thou art a goose , who art always frightened ,"
said the eldest.
`` Do n't be so silly !"
said the eldest , `` you have caught it on a nail"
The soldier thought , `` I must carry a token away with me ,"
The youngest cried out again.
`` Something is wrong , did you hear the crack ?"
`` What should cause that ,"
said the youngest , `` but the warm weather ? I feel very warm too"
On the shore they took leave of their princes , and promised to return the following night.
But the third time he took a cup away with him as a token.
he answered , `` In an underground castle with twelve princes ,"
and related how it had come to pass , and brought out the tokens.
But the princes were bewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve"
`` I will take great care ,"
said Little Red-Cap to her mother , and gave her hand on it.
`` Good-day , Little Red-Cap ,"
said he.
`` Thank you kindly , wolf"
`` Whither away so early , Little Red-Cap ?"
`` To my grandmother 's"
`` What have you got in your apron ?"
`` Where does your grandmother live , Little Red-Cap ?"
replied Little Red-Cap.
I must act craftily , so as to catch both"
It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time ;"
and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.
Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother 's house and knocked at the door.
`` Who is there ?"
`` Little Red-Cap ,"
replied the wolf.
`` She is bringing cake and wine ; open the door"
`` Lift the latch ,"
called out the grandmother , `` I am too weak , and can not get up"
She called out , `` Good morning ,"
but received no answer ; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.
There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face , and looking very strange.
`` Oh ! grandmother ,"
she said , `` what big ears you have !"
`` The better to hear you with , my child ,"
was the reply.
`` But , grandmother , what big eyes you have !"
she said.
`` The better to see you with , my dear"
`` But , grandmother , what large hands you have !"
`` The better to hug you with"
`` Oh ! but , grandmother , what a terrible big mouth you have !"
`` The better to eat you with !"
`` Do I find thee here , thou old sinner !"
said he.
`` I have long sought thee !"
and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also , but scarcely able to breathe.
Then all three were delighted.
`` Well ,"
said the grandmother , `` we will shut the door , that he may not come in"
But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.
Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full.
But Red-Cap went joyously home , and never did anything to harm any one"
There they sat in the darkness , and knew not when day or night began.
At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace.
Then said she to Maid Maleen , `` A great piece of luck has befallen thee.
It was in vain , too , that the bride offered her gold.
I have but to speak the word , and thy head will lie at thy feet"
He took her by the hand and led her to church.
`` What art thou saying ?"
asked the King 's son.
`` Nothing ,"
she replied , `` I was only thinking of Maid Maleen"
He was surprised that she knew about her , but kept silence.
`` What art thou saying there ?"
asked the King 's son.
`` Nothing ,"
she replied , `` I was only thinking of Maid Maleen"
`` Dost thou know Maid Maleen ?"
`` No ,"
she answered , `` how should I know her ; I have only heard of her"
`` What art thou saying there ?"
asked he.
`` Ah ,"
she answered , `` I was only thinking of Maid Maleen"
Then he took out a precious chain , put it round her neck , and fastened the clasp.
He led her home , but she did not speak a single word the whole way.
`` To which nettle-plant ?"
asked she ; `` I do n't talk to nettle-plants"
`` If thou didst not do it , then thou art not the true bride ,"
said he.
She went out and sought Maid Maleen.
`` Girl , what hast thou been saying to the nettle ?"
and she repeated the words which she had just heard.
`` But what didst thou say to the foot-bridge when we went over it ?"
asked the King 's son.
`` To the foot-bridge ?"
she answered.
`` I do n't talk to foot-bridges"
`` Then thou art not the true bride"
And ran out and found Maid Maleen , `` Girl , what didst thou say to the foot-bridge ?"
`` I said nothing but , `` Foot-bridge , do not break , I am not the true bride"
`` That costs thee thy life !"
and she repeated the words.
`` But what didst thou say to the church-door ?"
`` To the church-door ?"
she replied ; `` I do n't talk to church-doors"
`` Then thou art not the true bride"
`` I said nothing but , `` Church-door , break not , I am not the true bride"
`` That will break thy neck for thee !"
and she repeated the words.
`` But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door ?"
`` What jewel ?"
she answered ; `` thou didst not give me any jewel"
`` Where is the girl ?"
said he ; `` I want to see her , go and bring her here"
`` Thou art the true bride ,"
said he , `` who went with me to the church ; come with me now to my room"
To-day , however , the sun is shining on me once more.
I was married to thee in the church , and I am thy lawful wife"
Then they kissed each other , and were happy all the days of their lives.
The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off.
Little Hans , with your coat so gay , Follow me , follow me , fast as you may"
There was once on a time a princess who was extremely proud.
`` If that be all ,"
The princess said , `` Wrongly guessed ; let the second answer"
`` Wrongly guessed ,"
When therefore the evening came , our little tailor was taken down to the bear.
said the little tailor , `` I will soon make thee quiet"
When the bear saw that , he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too.
`` Eh !"
thought he , `` what a stupid blockhead I am ! I can not even crack a nut !"
and then he said to the tailor , `` Here , crack me the nuts"
`` There , see what a stupid fellow thou art !"
But no one will imagine that he accomplished it.
`` Light enough for a child.
`` So ,"
What dost thou think of that ? Wilt thou give me lessons ?"
`` With all my heart ,"
said the tailor , `` if thou hast a talent for it.
The bear in great fury ran after the carriage.
When the bear saw that , he turned round and ran away.
Whosoever does not believe this , must pay a thaler"
No one knew whither he carried them , for they were never seen more.
She took the keys and the egg , and promised to obey him in everything.
She washed and scrubbed , but she could not get it out.
`` Since thou hast gone into the room against my will ,"
said he , `` thou shalt go back into it against thine own.
Thy life is ended"
Then he threw her into the basin with the rest.
`` Now I will fetch myself the second ,"
She did not fare better than her sister.
Then he went and brought the third sister , but she was clever and crafty.
Then they rejoiced and kissed and caressed each other.
He now had no longer any power over her , and was forced to do whatsoever she desired.
`` Oh , very well ,"
Wilt thou go on at once ?"
Wilt thou go on directly ?"
`` I come from Fitcher 's house quite near"
`` And what may the young bride be doing ?"
At last she met the bridegroom , who was coming slowly back.
`` I come from Fitcher 's house quite near"
It sounded strange , but so pleasant that they forgot all their weariness and stepped quickly onwards.
They sang to it most charmingly , and that was the music which the travellers had heard.
In the midst of them sat an old man who was rather taller than the rest.
He wore a parti-coloured coat , and his iron-grey beard hung down over his breast.
The two remained standing full of astonishment , and watched the dance.
In a moment all had vanished , and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight.
A heavy weight on their limbs awakened them earlier than usual.
But he stayed another day to please him.
`` Even if the gold does weigh heavily ,"
said he , `` I will gladly bear that ,"
`` The gold I got the night before is still there for me ,"
Then he recognized the punishment of his greediness , and began to weep aloud.
The story is as follows.
No sooner said than done.
The hedgehog shut the house-door behind him , and took the path to the field.
When the hedgehog caught sight of the hare , he bade him a friendly good morning.
`` I am taking a walk ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` A walk !"
said the hare , with a smile.
`` It seems to me that you might use your legs for a better purpose"
`` That is just what I do think ,"
said the hare.
`` That can be put to the test ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` I wager that if we run a race , I will outstrip you"
`` That is ridiculous ! You with your short legs !"
What shall we wager ?"
`` A golden louis-d ` or and a bottle of brandy ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` Done ,"
said the hare.
`` Shake hands on it , and then we may as well come off at once"
`` Nay ,"
In half-an-hour I will be back again at this place"
Hereupon the hedgehog departed , for the hare was quite satisfied with this.
`` What is going on , then ?"
said his wife.
I am to run a race with him , and thou must be present"
`` Good heavens , husband ,"
`` Hold thy tongue , woman ,"
said the hedgehog , `` that is my affair.
Do n't begin to discuss things which are matters for men.
Be off , dress thyself , and come with me"
Look you , I will make the long field our race-course.
When he reached the top , the hare was already there.
`` Shall we start ?"
said the hare.
`` Certainly ,"
said the hedgehog.
`` Then both at once"
So saying , each placed himself in his own furrow.
The hare counted , `` Once , twice , thrice , and away !"
and went off like a whirlwind down the field.
The hare , however , thought to himself , `` That has not been done fairly ,"
and cried , `` It must be run again , let us have it again"
But the hedgehog 's wife stayed quietly in her place.
`` All right ,"
answered the hedgehog , `` for my part we 'll run as often as you choose"
At the seventy-fourth time , however , the hare could no longer reach the end.
Now person_0 means `` white ,"
and he was so called because of his color.
He was a real Japanese dog , and very like a small wolf in appearance.
Sure enough , person_0 was waiting for his master and the evening tit-bit.
Then the old man said `` Chin , chin !"
and person_0 sat up and begged , and his master gave him the food.
Here he began to dig very industriously with his paws , yelping with joy all the time.
The old man , unable to understand what it all meant , stood looking on in bewilderment.
But person_0 went on barking and digging with all his might.
At last all the gold coins lay shining on the ground.
The old man ran in to call his wife , and together they carried home the treasure.
Thus in one day the poor old man became rich.
He began to think that he , too , would like to find a fortune.
You must find them for me ! Where are they ? Where ? Where ?"
The old man 's disgust can be imagined.
This soon gave way to anger.
Instead of blaming his own greed for his disappointment , he blamed the poor dog.
Day after day went by and the good old man waited in vain.
Then he went to his neighbor and asked him to give him back his dog.
At this dreadful news person_0 's master wept many sad and bitter tears.
person_0 's master then cut the tree down and carried it home.
Out of the trunk he made a mortar.
They tasted the cakes and found them nicer than any other food.
So the envious man carried home the mortar , but he never brought it back.
He found him sitting by a big fire made of pieces of wood.
On the ground lay what looked very much like pieces of a broken mortar.
The good old man said : `` I am very sorry for that.
It is a great pity you did not ask me for the cakes if you wanted them.
I would have given you as many as ever you wanted.
The neighbor consented at once , and the old man carried home a basket full of ashes.
The old man 's delight knew no bounds , and he carefully preserved the remaining ashes.
`` And ,"
added the Knight , `` I shall be very much obliged if you will come at once"
The old man made an obeisance , and replied : `` I am that old man !"
I shall look on"
The old man now tucked up his kimono and made ready to climb the tree.
Saying `` Excuse me ,"
This would be the simplest task of all.
I have nothing to do to - day.
Let him try his art again ; it will amuse me to look on"
So the retainers went out and brought in the impostor before their Lord.
The satisfaction of false old man can now be imagined.
And the envious neighbor answered with a lie : `` Yes , my Lord !"
`` That is strange !"
said the Daimio.
`` I thought there was only one Hana-Saka-Jijii in the world ! Has he now some disciples ?"
`` I am the true Hana-Saka-Jijii.
The one who came to you before was only my disciple !"
replied the old man again.
`` Then you must be more skillful than the other.
Try what you can do and let me see !"
But all to no effect.
After trying several times , the ashes were blown into the Daimio 's eyes.
From this imprisonment the wicked old man was never freed.
Thus did he meet with punishment at last for all his evil doings.
A duck arrived from Portugal.
Some said she came from Spain , but that 's all the same.
`` He annoys me with his loud crowing !"
observed the person_0 duck.
How charmingly they sing ! There 's something quite pretty in their warbling.
I call it Portugal.
`` That 's just like the cat ; she 's a villain !"
said the person_0 duck.
`` I remember her ways when I had children of my own.
`` Poor little creature !"
they said , as one after another came up.
`` We certainly ca n't sing ,"
`` But I can talk of it ,"
`` That 's a good deed ,"
she said : `` the others may take example by it"
`` Piep !"
`` You are very kind-hearted , madam ,"
he said ; but he did not wish for a second bath.
`` I have never thought about my heart ,"
But pray make yourself at home , for one can make oneself comfortable.
`` She 's quite full of Portulak ,"
It was too witty ! And all the other ducks now began to notice the little singing bird.
`` The person_0 has certainly a greater command of language ,"
they said.
`` You have a lovely voice ,"
said one of the oldest.
`` Do n't plague him so ,"
interposed the person_0 duck : `` he requires rest and nursing.
My little singing bird , do you wish me to prepare another bath for you ?"
`` Oh no ! pray let me be dry !"
was the little bird 's petition.
`` The water-cure is the only remedy for me when I am unwell ,"
quoth the person_0.
`` Amusement is beneficial too ! The neighbouring fowls will soon come to pay their visit.
There are two Cochin Chinese among them.
`` You are a true singing bird ,"
But one requires a little more shrillness , that every hearer may hear that one is a male"
The two Chinese stood quite enchanted with the appearance of the singing bird.
`` He 's charming ,"
-LRB- Illustration : THE LITTLE SINGING BIRD RECEIVES DISTINGUISHED PATRONAGE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` We are of your race ,"
they continued.
It can not even be said of the inhabitants of the duck-yard.
`` I wonder what those two Chinese are always whispering to one another about ,"
whispered one duck to her friend.
`` They annoy me -- we have never spoken to them"
Now the drake came up.
He thought the little singing bird was a sparrow.
`` Well , I do n't understand the difference ,"
he said ; `` and indeed it 's all the same thing.
He 's only a plaything , and if one has them , why , one has them"
`` Do n't attach any value to what he says ,"
the person_0 whispered.
`` He 's very respectable in business matters ; and with him business takes precedence of everything.
But now I shall lie down for a rest.
The little singing bird busied himself with his broken wing.
But the neighbour 's fowls were awake.
The Chinese were the first to leave the duck-yard ; and the other fowls soon followed them.
The witty little duck said of the person_0 that the old lady was becoming a ducky dotard.
At this the other ducks laughed and cackled aloud.
`` Ducky dotard ,"
they whispered ; `` that 's too witty !"
and then they repeated the former joke about Portulak , and declared that it was vastly amusing.
And then they lay down.
`` Piep !"
he cried ; `` you trod very hard upon me , madam"
`` Well , why do you lie in my way ?"
the duck retorted.
`` You must not be so touchy.
said the little bird `` the ` piep ' came out of my beak unawares"
`` Now I want to rest after my dinner ,"
said the person_0.
`` You must conform to the rules of the house while you 're here.
I want to sleep now"
The little singing bird was quite taken aback , for he had meant it kindly.
`` Give that to a chicken !"
she said , `` and do n't be always standing in my way"
`` Why are you angry with me ?"
replied the little singing bird.
`` What have I done ?"
`` Done !"
`` Yesterday it was sunshine here ,"
said the little bird , `` but to-day it 's cloudy and the air is close"
`` You do n't know much about the weather , I fancy ,"
retorted the person_0.
`` The day is not done yet.
Do n't stand there looking so stupid"
`` Impertinent creature !"
I 've taken your part , and will teach you good manners"
`` Now , what 's the meaning of this ?"
I 've been like a mother to him I know that , for I 've a good heart"
Then the neighbour 's cock stuck his head into the yard , and crowed with steam-engine power.
`` You 'll kill me with your crowing !"
she cried.
`` It 's all your fault.
He 's lost his head , and I am very near losing mine"
`` There 's not much lying where he fell !"
observed the cock.
`` Speak of him with respect ,"
retorted the person_0 duck , `` for he had song , manners , and education.
And all the ducks came crowding round the little dead singing bird.
`` We shall never get such a singing bird again ; he was almost a Chinese ,"
`` We 've hearts of our own ,"
they said ; `` nobody can deny that"
`` Hearts !"
repeated the person_0 , `` yes , that we have , almost as much as in Portugal"
`` Let us think of getting something to satisfy our hunger ,"
said the drake , `` for that 's the most important point.
If one of our toys is broken , why , we have plenty more !"
Dost thou imagine thou art to idle away the whole day ?"
The maiden looked up , and an old woman was by her side.
The girl lay down on her bed , and soon fell asleep.
`` Just look , you awkward creature ,"
When she went out she said , `` The creature is worth more than her salt.
I must give her some work that is still harder"
Go into the thicket and lie down and sleep ; I will soon do thy work"
She went to her step-mother , and showed her that the work was done.
`` It ought to have been done long before this ,"
said she , and grew white with anger , but she meditated something new.
The maiden was dismayed , and said , `` How can I complete such a great work ?"
`` I will endure no opposition ,"
screamed the step-mother.
She sat down and wept , and still she hoped the old woman would help her.
If it would be a pleasure to thee , thou canst live in it thyself"
When the maiden had gone away , the old woman touched the gray rocks.
The inside of the castle was being finished while evening was drawing near.
She hurried to the castle , and entered by the open door.
The steps were spread with red cloth , and the golden balustrade beset with flowering trees.
When she saw the splendor of the apartment , she stood as if turned to stone.
The girl went and told her that the castle was ready.
`` I will move into it at once ,"
said she , and rose from her seat.
`` Thou seest ,"
`` Now we will go down below ,"
said she , looking at the girl with malicious eyes.
Nothing was wanting , not even a coal-box and water-pail.
`` Which is the way to the cellar ?"
she cried.
`` If that is not abundantly filled , it shall go ill with thee"
And now the magnificent castle belonged to the girl alone.
She at first did not know how to reconcile herself to her good fortune.
And soon the fame of the beauty and riches of the maiden went over all the world.
Wooers presented themselves daily , but none pleased her.
I will wait here under the lime-tree until thou returnest"
The maid stayed beneath the lime-tree until sunset , but he did not return.
She sat three days from morning till evening , waiting for him , but in vain.
I will go out and seek him , and will not come back until I have found him"
Far and wide did she wander through the world , but she found him not.
the little calf knelt down , and she stroked it.
`` Alas !"
said she , `` I believed him true to me , but he has forgotten me"
Next day he again came along the road.
When he was aware of the voice , he looked down and reined in his horse.
`` Alas !"
said she , `` he no longer knows me ,"
and her grief was ever greater.
`` Now will I try my last chance ,"
The King 's son went to meet her , but he did not recognize her.
`` Do but tell who thou art ,"
said he , `` I feel just as if I had already known thee a long time"
`` Dost thou not know what I did when thou leftest me ?"
`` Come ,"
said he to her , `` here I stay no longer ,"
gave her his hand , and led her down to the carriage.
The illuminated windows already shone in the distance.
When they drove past the lime-tree , countless glow-worms were swarming about it.
It shook its branches , and sent forth their fragrance.
Long , long ago there lived a man called person_0.
His surname meant `` Millionaire ,"
One day , without any reason whatsoever , the thought of death and sickness came to him.
The idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched.
`` I should like to live ,"
The ordinary span of a man 's life is very short"
person_0 had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named Shin-no - Shiko.
He was one of the most able and powerful rulers in Chinese history.
He built all the large palaces , and also the famous great wall of China.
He could not get away from it.
Ah -- if only he could find the `` Elixir of Life ,"
he would be happy.
of which he had so often read and heard.
Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever.
At last , after wandering in an unknown region for many days , he met a hunter.
`` Can you tell me ,"
asked person_0 , `` where the hermits live who have the Elixir of Life ?"
`` No"
It is said that he is chief of a band of two hundred followers"
`` You , person_0 , are fond of good living and of every comfort.
`` In answer to your prayer , however , I will help you in another way.
person_0 obeyed wonderingly.
The crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort.
On and on they went for thousands of miles.
After several days they reached an island.
The crane flew some distance inland and then alighted.
He walked first round about the country and then through the town.
Everything was , of course , quite strange , and different from his own land.
All this person_0 soon found out by talking to the islanders.
He found himself , according to his ideas , in the land of Topsyturvydom.
Everything was upside down.
He had wished to escape from dying.
These they swallowed eagerly , hoping for death to come so that they might go to Paradise.
Vainly they tried to imagine what death could be like.
Without any change to live on forever seemed to this people wearisome and sad.
person_0 was delighted.
He was the only happy man on the island.
For his part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy life.
As years went by , however , things did not go as smoothly as at first.
He had heavy losses in business , and several times some affairs went wrong with his neighbors.
This caused him great annoyance.
No sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket.
person_0 was amazed to see that it had remained undamaged after all these years.
Once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it.
He tried to stop the bird in vain.
The crane held on its way for thousands of miles across the ocean.
person_0 fell with it.
He looked round , but there was no ship in sight.
He swallowed a quantity of sea-water , which only increased his miserable plight.
As it came nearer it opened its huge mouth ready to devour him.
He was in a cold perspiration with fright , and utterly bewildered.
Suddenly a bright light came towards him , and in the light stood a messenger.
These things are not for such as you -- your life is not austere enough.
The angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking , and person_0 took the lesson to heart.
But the two others said , `` We want something more from good luck than mere silver ,"
and did not touch it , but went onwards.
The second brother stopped , took thought with himself , and was undecided.
`` What shall I do ?"
`` This time ,"
said he , `` my wish has been fulfilled at the right moment"
and folded it up tidily and put it in his pocket.
`` Now I perceive ,"
said he , `` in what kitchen my cooking is done.
Thou shalt be dearer to me than the mountains of silver and gold"
For he saw plainly that it was a wishing-cloth.
`` Good evening , blackbird !"
said the youth.
`` How dost thou get on in thy solitude ?"
`` One day is like another ,"
`` Many thanks ,"
`` Who is to prepare it for thee ?"
said the charcoal-burner.
`` And yet there shall be a meal ,"
answered the youth , `` and better than any thou hast ever tasted"
`` I must first know what these wonderful powers are ,"
answered the youth.
`` That will I tell thee ,"
`` So far as I am concerned ,"
said the youth , `` if nothing else can be done , we will exchange ,"
`` March with all speed to the charcoal-burner , and demand my wishing-cloth back"
By sunset he came to another charcoal-burner , who was making his supper ready by the fire.
said the sooty fellow.
`` No , he replied , this time thou shalt be my guest ,"
and he spread out his cloth , which was instantly covered with the most beautiful dishes.
They ate and drank together , and enjoyed themselves heartily.
The hat is of no use to me , and I will willingly give it for thy table-cloth"
`` That suits me very well ,"
he answered , took the hat , put it on , and left his table-cloth behind him.
`` One thing comes on the top of another ,"
thought he , `` and I feel as if my luck had not yet come to an end"
Neither had his thoughts deceived him.
`` Now ,"
He will come in his carriage in full splendor like a mighty king , not like a beggar ,"
and they drove him out of doors.
The King said , `` This vagabond is not brought to order yet ,"
and next day sent a still larger troop against him , but they could do even less.
`` And now ,"
Then she thought to herself , `` Is it possible that his wonderful powers lie in the knapsack ?"
`` Dear child ,"
And he revealed to her the wonderful virtue with which it was endowed.
Then he would have been ruined if he had not had the little hat.
But his hands were scarcely at liberty before he turned it twice.
Then no one opposed him any longer , and he made himself King of the whole country"
The persimmon-seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone.
The simple-minded crab could not resist the monkey 's clever persuasion.
`` How delicious they will be to eat !"
he said to himself.
He determined to ask the monkey to help him , and set out to find him.
He consented to go with the crab to pick the fruit for him.
The persimmon is as hard as stone when it is unripe.
The monkey 's missile struck home and the crab was sorely hurt by the blow.
There he lay a pitiful sight at the foot of the tree he had himself planted.
At this dreadful sight the poor young crab sat down and wept.
He looked about for some clue which would lead him to discover the murderer.
He besought the mortar with tears to help him avenge his father 's death.
In a short time the bee and the chestnut arrived.
Mortar went home with the young crab to help him bury his poor father.
So he would not go out , and kept himself at home for several days.
Little did he know in his so-called `` monkey 's wisdom"
that this seeming unconcern was part of the young crab 's plan.
So the monkey returned home from his walk quite content.
He told himself he had nothing now to fear.
My master hopes you will honor his house with your kind visit"
He could not guess that a plot had just been set in motion against him.
We were great friends as you know.
I remember that we once exchanged a rice - dumpling for a persimmon-seed.
I accept your kind invitation with many thanks.
I shall be delighted to do honor to my poor old friend !"
And he screwed some false tears from his eyes.
But aloud he thanked the monkey politely and went home.
He changed his dress and set out solemnly to visit the young crab.
As soon as the bows of meeting were over they led him to a hall.
Here the young chief mourner came to receive him.
When the young crab had conducted the monkey to the tearoom he left him and retired.
Time passed and still he did not return.
At last the monkey became impatient.
He said to himself : `` This tea ceremony is always a very slow affair.
I am tired of waiting so long.
I am very thirsty after drinking so much sake at the dinner !"
`` Then you -- are -- my -- enemy ?"
gasped the monkey brokenly.
`` Of course ,"
said the young crab.
`` It -- was -- your -- father 's -- fault -- not -- mine !"
gasped the unrepentant monkey.
`` Can you still lie ? I will soon put an end to your breath !"
and with that he cut off the monkey 's head with his pitcher claws.
This is the end of the story of the monkey , the crab , and the persimmon-seed"
Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.
Let her get the fire at her own house.
Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters.
I can not tell how it is"
But the other sisters said , `` Oh no , do not be unkind , Balna.
The girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother.
Let us rather invite her to come and have some of the fruit"
And calling her to them , they gave her one of the pomeloes.
I ate one , and it was the nicest I have ever tasted"
She answered , `` There is only one thing that will make my headache well.
Then they all began to cry very bitterly.
I can not tell how it is !"
And her daughter said , `` I will watch"
He replied , `` Yes , whatever it is , I will do it"
He found them crying by the ruins of their mother 's grave.
So the first and eldest person_0 took the eldest person_0ss home with him , and married her.
But he said , `` I am a holy man , you must let me in"
Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him , or marry you"
And he answered , `` One of the person_0sses gave it to me as a present"
At hearing which they let him go without further questioning.
Thus time went on , till Balna 's son was fourteen years old.
Then the little person_0 thought , `` These must be my parents and my uncles.
I have found what I seek at last"
To this the person_0 agreed.
You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years ; now rather speak kindly.
`` And do tell me ,"
`` Why do you ask ?"
said he.
`` Because ,"
`` It is true ,"
he added , `` that I am not as others.
It is , however ,"
So saying , he went away.
It was the middle of the day , and the heat was very great.
`` Sir ,"
replied the person_0 , `` I will not sell my parrot"
`` It is done as you desire ,"
said the Magician , `` only give me my parrot"
`` Now , give me my parrot ,"
repeated Punchkin.
`` Not so fast , my master ,"
`` Give me my parrot !"
cried Punchkin.
Punchkin then stretched out his left arm , crying , `` Give me my parrot !"
The person_0 pulled off the parrot 's second wing , and the Magician 's left arm tumbled off.
`` Give me my parrot !"
cried he , and fell on his knees.
`` Take your parrot , then ,"
And as to the rest of the world , every one went to his own house"
`` What fine linen ,"
said he , and put one piece in his pocket.
He returned home , thought no more of what he had found , and went to bed.
`` What do you want ?"
he asked.
`` Give me back my dress ,"
answered the voice , `` that you took away from me last evening by the lake"
`` You shall have it back again ,"
said the drummer , `` if you will tell me who you are"
`` Ah ,"
My sisters have gone away , but I have been forced to stay behind.
I entreat you to give me my dress back"
`` Be easy , poor child ,"
said the drummer.
`` I will willingly give it back to you"
He took it out of his pocket , and reached it to her in the dark.
She snatched it in haste , and wanted to go away with it.
`` Stop a moment , perhaps I can help you"
`` When I want to do a thing I always can do it ,"
said the drummer ; `` I am sorry for you , and have no fear of anything.
But I do not know the way which leads to the glass-mountain"
`` The road goes through the great forest , in which the man-eaters live ,"
she answered , `` and more than that , I dare not tell you"
And then he heard her wings quiver , as she flew away.
`` Wretch !"
`` I am drumming ,"
he replied , `` because I want to show the way to many thousands who are following me"
`` What do they want in my forest ?"
demanded the giant.
`` Oho !"
said the giant , `` I will trample you all to death like so many ants"
`` Dost thou think thou canst do anything against us ?"
I can strangle wolves and bears , but I can not protect myself from these earth-worms"
`` Listen , little fellow ,"
`` Thou hast long legs ,"
`` Come here , worm ,"
The giant thought , `` That is the signal for the other people to turn back"
and so it was.
He began to climb , but that was useless , for he always slipped back again.
`` If one was a bird now ,"
thought he ; but what was the good of wishing , no wings grew for him.
`` What fools you are ,"
said he , `` to quarrel about a saddle , when you have not a horse for it !"
`` The saddle is worth fighting about ,"
The saddle belongs to us in common.
It is my turn to ride on it , but that other man will not let me do it"
`` I will soon decide the quarrel ,"
He went to the door and knocked.
`` Entrance , food , and a bed for the night ,"
replied the drummer.
`` That thou shalt have ,"
said the old woman , `` if thou wilt perform three services in return"
`` Why not ?"
he answered , `` I am not afraid of any kind of work , however hard it may be"
`` That is strange work ,"
said the drummer , but he went to the pond , and began to empty it.
So he gave it up and sat down.
He looked at her , and saw that she was wondrously beautiful.
`` Ah ,"
`` Stay here ,"
said the maiden , `` I will help thee out of thy difficulty.
Thou art tired , lay thy head in my lap , and sleep.
When thou awakest again , thy work will be done"
The drummer did not need to be told that twice.
Fishes , come out"
When the drummer awoke , he saw with amazement that all was done.
'"
She gave him an axe , a mallet , and two wedges.
But the axe was made of lead , and the mallet and wedges were of tin.
`` Lay thy head on my lap ,"
said she , `` and sleep ; when thou awakest , thy work will be done"
'"
The old woman came , `` There thou seest how easy the work was !"
said she ; `` but for whom hast thou left that bough which is lying there still ?"
`` For thee , thou witch ,"
he replied , and gave her a blow with it.
The maiden , however , did not desert him in his need.
`` Listen to me ,"
The maiden departed , and the old woman came sneaking up to him.
`` Oh , I am cold ,"
He carried the log out , and laid it down.
Promise to be true to me , and thou shalt be my husband.
We shall not want for riches , we shall have enough with what the witch has gathered together here"
The maiden left the gold and silver where it was , and took only the precious stones.
`` I do not like the old saddle ,"
said she , `` I need only turn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home"
`` Very well , then ,"
answered the drummer , `` then wish us in front of the town-gate"
`` Ah ,"
said the King 's daughter , `` I beg thee to be careful.
`` How can I forget thee ?"
said he , and promised her to come back very soon , and gave his hand upon it.
He emptied out his pockets , and laid handfuls of the largest jewels on the table.
The parents had not the least idea what to do with the riches.
The son was content to do as his parents desired"
At length she heard the people saying , `` The wedding will take place to-morrow"
Then she said , `` I will try if I can win his heart back"
When all the guests were assembled , she entered the hall.
`` Not for money ,"
On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring and said , `` A dress as silvery as the moon"
But the drummer , who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught , could not be aroused.
Sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest.
Suddenly , his memory returned to him.
`` Ah ,"
`` This is my true bride ,"
said he ; `` if I marry the other , I shall do a great wrong"
The parents , when they heard how everything had happened , gave their consent.
The first bride received the beautiful dresses as a compensation , and declared herself satisfied"
There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage.
Rose-red answered , `` Never so long as we live ,"
and their mother would add , `` What one has she must share with the other"
And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children.
In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the wrekin.
The kettle was of copper and shone like gold , so brightly was it polished.
`` Poor bear ,"
The bear said , `` Here , children , knock the snow out of my coat a little ;"
`` Where are you going , then , dear bear ?"
asked Snow-white.
`` I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs.
The bear ran away quickly , and was soon out of sight behind the trees.
A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get fire-wood.
`` What are you about there , little man ?"
asked Rose-red.
`` You stupid , prying goose !"
`` I will run and fetch some one ,"
said Rose-red.
`` You senseless goose !"
`` Do n't be impatient ,"
said Snow-white , `` I will help you ,"
and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket , and cut off the end of the beard.
Bad luck to you !"
Some time after that Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish.
They ran to it and found it was the dwarf.
`` Where are you going ?"
said Rose-red ; `` you surely do n't want to go into the water ?"
`` I am not such a fool !"
cried the dwarf ; `` do n't you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in ?"
I can not let myself be seen by my people.
I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes !"
Directly afterwards they heard a loud , piteous cry.
`` Why do you stand gaping there ?"
cried the dwarf , and his ashen-gray face became copper-red with rage.
Then in the dread of his heart he cried , `` Dear Mr.
`` I am a King 's son ,"
Now he has got his well-deserved punishment"
The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years.
He was a brave man , however , and putting aside all fear went forward dauntlessly.
He had only gone a few steps when he heard some one calling him from behind.
`` Yes , it was I ,"
answered the man : `` I have an earnest request to make to you.
Do you think you can grant it to me ?"
`` If it is in my power to do so I will ,"
answered Hidesato , `` but first tell me who you are ?"
`` And what is it you have to ask of me !"
said Hidesato.
`` I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede , who lives on the mountain beyond ,"
and the Dragon King pointed to a high peak on the opposite shore of the lake.
I am powerless to save them.
I beg you to have pity upon me.
Will you not help me and kill my enemy the centipede ?"
The warrior asked where the centipede lived , so that he might attack the creature at once.
So Hidesato was conducted to the palace of the Dragon King , under the bridge.
Never had Hidesato seen anything so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake.
Hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him.
The dishes were crystallized lotus leaves and flowers , and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony.
The Dragon King stood by the warrior 's side trembling with fear.
`` The centipede ! The centipede ! Those two balls of fire are its eyes.
It is coming for its prey ! Now is the time to kill it"
Hidesato showed not the least sign of fear.
He tried to calm the Dragon King.
`` Do n't be afraid.
I shall surely kill the centipede.
Just bring me my bow and arrows"
He looked across the waters.
Then suddenly the warrior remembered that he had heard that human saliva was deadly to centipedes.
But this was no ordinary centipede.
This was so monstrous that even to think of such a creature made one creep with horror.
Hidesato determined to try his last chance.
At last the dreadful night was over.
Day dawned beautiful and clear.
The centipede was gone from the mountain.
The gratitude of the Dragon King knew no bounds.
Another feast was prepared , more sumptuous than the first.
The presents that they carried were as follows : First , a large bronze bell.
Second , a bag of rice.
Third , a roll of silk.
Fourth , a cooking pot.
Fifth , a bell.
The cooking pot was wonderful , too.
Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed.
Now began a bad time for the poor step-child.
`` Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor with us ?"
said they.
`` He who wants to eat bread must earn it ; out with the kitchen-wench"
`` Just look at the proud princess , how decked out she is !"
they cried , and laughed , and led her into the kitchen.
.
And as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty , they called her Cinderella.
`` Beautiful dresses ,"
said one , `` Pearls and jewels ,"
said the second.
`` And thou , Cinderella ,"
said he , `` what wilt thou have ?"
`` Father , break off for me the first branch which knocks against your hat on your way home"
Then he broke off the branch and took it with him.
And it grew , however , and became a handsome tree.
`` Thou go , Cinderella !"
Hardly had one hour passed before they had finished , and all flew out again.
And she thought to herself , `` That she most certainly can not do"
On this she turned her back on Cinderella , and hurried away with her two proud daughters.
She put on the dress with all speed , and went to the festival.
The prince went to meet her , took her by the hand and danced with her.
She danced till it was evening , and then she wanted to go home.
But the King 's son said , `` I will go with thee and bear thee company ,"
for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged.
She escaped from him , however , and sprang into the pigeon-house.
The old man thought , `` Can it be Cinderella ?"
Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the preceding day.
When others came and invited her , he said , `` She is my partner"
But she sprang away from him , and into the garden behind the house.
Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pears.
The father thought , `` Can it be Cinderella ?"
and had an axe brought and cut the tree down , but no one was on it.
Then were the two sisters glad , for they had pretty feet.
Then he took her on his his horse as his bride and rode away with her.
Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was streaming from it.
Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again.
`` This also is not the right one ,"
said he , `` have you no other daughter ?"
`` No ,"
He absolutely insisted on it , and Cinderella had to be called.
And thus , for their wickedness and falsehood , they were punished with blindness as long as they lived"
Wife 'Twas clearly I , howe'er , for her you took.
-- Wife Indeed I do , 'twas myself.
Neighbour A flannel petticoat display 'd the elf.
Wife How hard of credence ! -- 'twas myself I vow.
There was once on a time a poor man , who could no longer support his only son.
I would rather go away and see how I can earn my bread"
So the father gave him his blessing , and with great sorrow took leave of him.
Then the others followed him , and he pressed on and conquered the enemy.
The King had a daughter who was very beautiful , but she was also very strange.
`` If he loves me with all his heart ,"
said she , `` of what use will life be to him afterwards ?"
`` But dost thou know what thou must promise ?"
said the King.
`` I must be buried with her ,"
Then the King consented , and the wedding was solemnized with great splendor.
and hewed the snake in three pieces.
`` Thou art with me , dear wife ,"
He was astonished when he saw them come alone , and asked what had happened to them.
and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep themselves hidden from every one.
He said , `` Why dost thou come back alone ? Where is thy husband ?"
`` Ah , dear father ,"
He was present at his death , and can tell you all"
The King said , `` I will make the dead alive again ,"
and opened the chamber , and bade the two come out.
The King said , `` There is no mercy.
SHE entered as the holy monk desired , And they together to his cell retired.
If me thou disbeliev ` st , thy mother ask ; She thoroughly can undertake the task.
ON such a point we readily should say , Long live the fools who wit so well display !"
`` Do give me one night 's lodging , and a little to eat and drink ,"
said he to her , `` or I shall starve"
`` Oho !"
`` What do you wish ?"
said the soldier.
`` That you should dig all round my garden for me , tomorrow"
`` I see well enough ,"
`` To-morrow , you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work.
Next day the old woman took him to the well , and let him down in a basket.
He found the blue light , and made her a signal to draw him up again.
`` No ,"
The witch fell into a passion , let him down again into the well , and went away.
`` This shall be my last pleasure ,"
thought he , pulled it out , lit it at the blue light and began to smoke.
`` What commands have I to give thee ?"
replied the soldier , quite astonished.
`` I must do everything thou biddest me ,"
said the little man.
`` Good ,"
said the soldier ; `` then in the first place help me out of this well"
`` It is all done ,"
said he , `` and the witch is already hanging on the gallows.
What further commands has my lord ?"
inquired the dwarf.
`` At this moment , none ,"
Thereupon he vanished from his sight.
The soldier returned to the town from which he had come.
`` What am I to do ?"
asked the little man.
When twelve o'clock had struck , the door sprang open , and the mannikin carried in the princess.
`` Aha ! art thou there ?"
cried the soldier , `` get to thy work at once ! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber"
`` I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning ,"
`` The dream may have been true ,"
said the King , `` I will give thee a piece of advice.
And again the princess was compelled to do servant 's work until cock-crow.
`` We must think of something else ,"
`` Do what I bid thee ,"
Next morning the King had the entire town searched for his daughter 's shoe.
His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted.
`` Have no fear ,"
said the latter to his master.
When he was led forth to die , he begged a last favor of the King.
`` What is it ?"
asked the King.
`` That I may smoke one more pipe on my way"
`` Thou mayst smoke three ,"
answered the King , `` but do not imagine that I will spare thy life"
Then the little dogs said , `` No , no , we will not go.
If the mistress gets to know it , she will beat us"
The countryman said , `` She will know nothing about it.
Do come ; after all , she never gives you anything good"
So they just had to run away"
The shepherd told all this to his mother , who said , `` Take the third for thy wife"
This he did , and lived contentedly and happily with her"
Now , evaporated apples are nothing more or less than dried apples.
The cook of the loggers ' camp used them to make apple pies.
Now you see what made person_0 Coon feel so queer and uncomfortable.
He had first eaten his dried apples.
And then he had soaked them , by drinking out of the brook.
But he did it , though it cost him a few groans.
And he frightened his mother , too.
`` I only hope you 're not poisoned ,"
she said , when person_0 told her what he had been doing.
And that remark frightened person_0 more than ever.
He was sure he was never going to feel any better.
Poor Mrs.
Coon was much worried all the rest of the night.
But when morning came she knew that person_0 was out of danger.
She knew it because of something he said.
It was this : `` Oh , dear ! I wish I had something to eat !"
Once on a time a poor pious peasant died , and arrived before the gate of heaven.
Fatty wanted to see what it was , though he hardly thought it was anything to eat.
But whenever he came upon something new he always wanted to examine it.
So now Fatty hurried to see what the strange thing was.
Fatty Coon looked carefully at the bright thing.
He walked all around it , so he could see it from all sides.
And at last he thought he knew what it was.
He saw nothing strange in that ; for he knew that the moon often touched the earth.
`` Oh ! the moon ! the moon !"
Fatty shouted.
He had run so fast that , being so plump , he was quite out of breath.
And that was all he could say.
`` Well , well ! What about the moon !"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
`` Anybody would think you had found it , almost"
And she smiled.
Fatty puffed and gasped.
And at last he caught his breath again.
he said.
`` Big , and round , and shiny ! Let 's all go and bring it home !"
`` Well , well , well !"
Mrs.
Coon was puzzled.
`` Are you sure ?"
she asked.
`` Oh , yes , Mother !"
Fatty could hardly wait , he was so eager to lead the way.
And with many a shake of the head , Mrs.
Coon , with her family , started off to see the moon.
`` There !"
Fatty cried , as they came in sight of the bright , round thing.
`` There it is -- just as I told you !"
And they all set up a great shouting.
All but Mrs.
Coon.
She was n't quite sure , even yet , that Fatty had really found the moon.
And she walked close to the shining thing and peered at it.
But not too close ! Mrs.
Coon did n't go too near it.
And she told her children quite sternly to stand back.
It was well that she did ; for when Mrs.
A trap ! THAT was what Mrs.
Coon saw right in front of her.
Yes -- it was a mercy that Fatty had n't begun knocking it about.
And there he would have been , caught fast.
It was no wonder that Mrs.
Coon hurried her family away from that spot.
And Fatty led them all home again.
He could n't get away from his moon fast enough"
`` I can help thee to do that ,"
said the fox.
`` Come to me early to-morrow morning , and I will show thee one"
First came an old discharged soldier.
`` Is that a man ?"
inquired the wolf.
`` No ,"
answered the fox , `` that was one"
Afterwards came a little boy who was going to school.
`` Is that a man ?"
`` No , that is going to be one"
At length came a hunter with his double-barrelled gun at his back , and hanger by his side.
The wolf then rushed on the man.
aimed , and fired his small shot in his face.
`` Well , brother wolf ,"
said the fox , `` how hast thou got on with man ?"
`` Ah !"
`` See what a braggart thou art !"
said the fox.
`` Thou throwest thy hatchet so far that thou canst not fetch it back again !"
He took it home , therefore , and the two children grew up together.
`` If thou wilt never repeat it to anyone , I will tell thee why"
Fundevogel said , `` Neither now , nor ever will I leave thee"
Then said Lina , `` Then I will tell thee.
The two children therefore got up , dressed themselves quickly , and went away.
But when she came in , and went to the beds , both the children were gone.
Then the cook sent three servants after them , who were to run and overtake the children.
Fundevogel said , `` Neither now , nor ever"
Then said Lina , `` Do thou become a rose-tree , and I the rose upon it"
Then said they , `` There is nothing to be done here ,"
They had therefore to go out and look for the second time.
The children , however , saw them coming from a distance.
Then Lina said , `` Fundevogel , never leave me , and I will never leave thee"
Fundevogel said , `` Neither now , nor ever"
Said Lina , `` Then do thou become a church , and I 'll be the chandelier in it"
They said therefore to each other , `` What can we do here , let us go home"
Then said Lina , `` Fundevogel , never leave me , and I will never leave thee"
Then said Fundevogel , `` Neither now , nor ever"
Said Lina , `` Be a fishpond , and I will be the duck upon it"
`` I will see to it , master ,"
answered Grethel.
The master said , `` I will run myself , and fetch the guest"
and took a good drink , and took yet another hearty draught.
So she took another hearty drink , and let the second chicken rejoin the first.
`` Yes , sir , I will soon serve up ,"
answered Grethel.
Presently the guest came , and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.
Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it !"
The guest heard the sharpening , and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could.
`` Eh , why , Grethel ? What do you mean by that ?"
`` Yes ,"
`` That 's a nice trick !"
said her master , and lamented the fine chickens.
`` If he had but left me one , so that something remained for me to eat"
He called to him to stop , but the guest pretended not to hear.
meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken , and not take both.
`` Thirty years ,"
replied God ; `` does that content thee ?"
`` Ah , Lord ,"
answered the ass , `` that is a long time.
Relieve me of a portion of this long time"
Then God had pity on him and relieved him of eighteen years.
The ass went away comforted , and the dog appeared.
`` How long wouldst thou like to live ?"
said God to him.
`` Thirty years are too many for the ass , but thou wilt be satisfied with that"
`` Lord ,"
God saw that he was right , and released him from twelve years of life.
Then came the monkey.
`` Thou wilt certainly live thirty years willingly ?"
said the Lord to him.
`` Ah ! Lord ,"
When it rains porridge I have no spoon.
God was gracious and took off ten.
`` Thirty years shalt thou live ,"
said the Lord.
`` Is that enough for thee ?"
`` What a short time ,"
`` I will add to it the ass 's eighteen years ,"
said God.
`` That is not enough ,"
replied the man.
`` Thou shalt also have the dog 's twelve years"
`` Still too little !"
`` Well , then ,"
The man went away , but was not satisfied.
So man lives seventy years.
Then man is weak-headed and foolish , does silly things , and becomes the jest of the children"
`` Yes ,"
said the King ; `` if you can cross the mountain without falling , you shall have her"
Meanwhile the King 's daughter had fallen quite deep down into the earth into a great cave.
So she did all he bade her.
`` No ,"
said she , `` Old Rinkrank , I will not open the door for thee"
`` I have washed thy dishes already ,"
said she.
`` I have made thy bed already ,"
said she.
He tried to peep in , but could not get his head through because of his long beard.
But she said not until he gave her the ladder with which he ascended the mountain.
Then , whether he would or not , he had to tell her where the ladder was.
She went to her father , and told him all that had happened to her.
Then the King had Old Rinkrank put to death , and took all his gold and silver.
The princess married her betrothed , and lived right happily in great magnificence and joy"
`` If that is all ,"
`` Hollo ,"
He stopped , and felt afraid and alarmed , and pondered over the circumstance.
The woman ran as fast as she could by by-ways so as to get home first.
`` No ,"
said he , `` I see very well that winding wo n't do ,"
Neverthless after some time , the man again began to complain of the disorder in the house.
`` Wife ,"
said he , `` it is really a shame that the spun yarn should lie there all entangled !"
`` I 'll tell you what ,"
`` Yes , that will do ,"
said the man.
but she was secretly contriving another trick.
The man was willing and took good care not to loiter.
He got up as quickly as he could , and went into the kitchen.
But you yourself must own she was an odious woman !"
She walked about and looked for a road , but could find none.
Once , however , the dove came and said , `` Wilt thou do something for my sake ?"
`` With all my heart ,"
said the girl.
The girl went to the little house , and came to the door.
There sat an old woman who stared when she saw her , and said , `` Good-day my child"
The girl gave her no answer , and opened the door.
`` Whither away ,"
But the girl was silent , got away from her , and went straight into the room.
She turned them over and looked for the plain one , but could not find it.
My inclination to trade revived.
We embarked on board a good ship , and after recommending ourselves to God , set sail.
We traded from island to island , and exchanged commodities with great profit.
I made a very good meal , and afterwards fell asleep.
I can not tell how long I slept , but when I awoke the ship was gone.
I was very much surprised to find the ship gone.
I leave you to guess at my melancholy reflections in this sad condition.
But all this was in vain , and my repentance out of season.
It was at least fifty paces round.
In short , the bird lighted , and sat over the egg to hatch it.
When day appeared the serpents retired , and I came out of the cave trembling.
I had scarcely laid me down before the eagles came.
I could not moderate my joy when I found myself delivered from the danger I have mentioned.
Here I exchanged some of my diamonds for good merchandise.
My father left me the best inheritance ; to wit -- good humor.
And who was my father ? Why , that has nothing to do with the humor.
He had to go first before the bishop even , and before the princes of the blood.
I am not quite young.
The newspaper every one can read for himself.
I heard it from my father , or found it out myself.
Now we are in the churchyard.
As if that was of any consequence.
Then sometimes the public applauded too much to suit his taste , and sometimes too little.
`` They 're like wet wood this evening ,"
he would say ; `` they wo n't kindle at all !"
Here rests a very happy man.
That is to say , a very grand man.
Everything is so nicely managed , it 's enough to put one into a good humor.
-LRB- Illustration : THE CHURCHYARD NARRATION.
Nobody derived any benefit from it , and no one even heard what the good thing was.
What an unhappy man he must be ! Here rests a remarkably stingy woman.
Here is a maiden of another kind.
Here sleeps a widow who carried melody in her mouth and gall in her heart.
Here 's a family sepulchre.
they declared his opinion to be the only true one , because he belonged to the family.
The great poet Goethe concludes his `` Faust"
with the words `` may be continued ;"
and our wanderings in the churchyard may be continued too.
And that 's my story"
Then said he , `` Tell Faithful John to come to me"
He is still of tender age , and can not always know how to guide himself.
On this , the old person_0 said , `` Now I die in comfort and peace"
I will show thee thy father 's palace"
`` There is something within it ,"
he replied , `` which would terrify thee"
and he went and tried to break open the door by force.
`` Ah , no ,"
I should have no rest day or night until I had seen it with my own eyes.
I shall not leave the place now until thou hast unlocked the door"
Then he strengthened him with wine , until he came to himself again.
The first words the person_0 said were , `` Ah , the beautiful portrait ! whose it it ?"
`` That is the princess of the Golden Dwelling ,"
answered Faithful John.
I will give my life to win her.
Thou art my most Faithful John , thou must help me"
Faithful John bade the person_0 stay behind on the ship , and wait for him.
`` Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me ,"
So he answered , `` I am a merchant ,"
and opened his apron , and let her look in.
Then she cried , `` Oh , what beautiful gold things !"
and put her pails down and looked at the golden wares one after the other.
She took him by the hand and led him upstairs , for she was the waiting-maid.
But Faithful John said , `` I am only the servant of a rich merchant.
They are the most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in gold"
Then she got into the ship , and the person_0 led her within.
`` Ah ,"
The person_0 , however , seized her hand , and said , `` I am not a merchant.
The first time that I looked on thy portrait , I fell fainting to the ground"
One cried , `` Oh , there he is carrying home the princess of the Golden Dwelling"
`` Yes ,"
replied the second , `` but he has not got her yet"
Said the third , `` But he has got her , she is sitting beside him in the ship"
Spake the second , `` But is there no escape ?"
Said the third , `` Is there no escape at all ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
`` But what avails that ?"
`` Good ,"
said the person_0 , `` he shall carry me to my palace ,"
`` Yes ,"
answered the person_0 , `` it shall be granted unto thee"
Then said Faithful John , `` I am unjustly condemned , and have always been true to thee ,"
Then cried the person_0 , `` Oh , my most Faithful John.
Pardon , pardon -- bring him down"
But as Faithful John spoke the last word he had fallen down lifeless and become a stone.
and ordered the stone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom beside his bed.
Some time passed and the Queen bore twins , two sons who grew fast and were her delight.
Then cried the person_0 , `` I will give everything I have in the world for thee"
He said to the person_0 , `` Thy truth shall not go unrewarded ,"
When she entered , he said to her , `` Hast thou been praying in the church ?"
`` Yes ,"
and told her how everything had occurred.
Then they dwelt together in much happiness until their death"
`` Thou wouldst go out with me ?"
said the father.
`` Stay here , thou wilt be of no use out there , besides thou mightest get lost !"
Whilst he was there , a great giant came over the hill.
`` Do thou see that great bogie ?"
But the giant thought , `` We must do better than that ,"
took him back again , and suckled him two years longer.
`` Now that will do ,"
said the giant , `` thou art perfect ,"
and took him back to the field from whence he had brought him.
His father was there following the plough.
`` No , no , thou art not my son ; and thou canst not plough go away !"
The farmer said , `` That is our son"
She called to him , `` Go away , we do not want thee !"
Then she said , `` Yes ,"
`` No ,"
she replied , `` that is all we have"
`` But that was only a taste , I must have more"
`` At length come a few crumbs ,"
So he went away , and gave out that he was a smith 's apprentice.
The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman.
`` Yes ,"
So he asked , `` How much wages dost thou want ?"
`` I do n't want any at all ,"
The miser was heartily satisfied , and thought he would thus save much money.
Then said he , `` I will only give you quite a small blow , that 's all"
`` Yes ,"
Then the bailiff was satisfied , for he , too , was a covetous fellow.
`` Ah ,"
The bailiff said they were to awaken him again , and tell him to harness the horses.
And then he stayed in bed two hours longer.
`` Do n't you see ,"
and drove on , and the others had to stay where they were.
`` No ,"
The head-servant consented to this delay.
The advice pleased the bailiff , and the head-servant was quite willing to go down the well.
So the bailiff cried , `` Sh-sh ,"
and pretended to frighten the hens away.
and behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing round his neck.
He said , `` I will manage it , just you go away to bed"
Then he went into the mill , and poured out the corn.
About eleven o'clock he went into the miller 's room , and sat down on the bench.
Then he said , `` If anything of that kind comes again , I shall strike out in return"
And when he had received a second box on the ear , he , too struck out.
And so it continued the whole night.
At daybreak , however , everything ceased.
But he said , `` Money , I will not have , I have enough of it"
She cried , `` No , no I can not bear it ,"
and opened the other window , because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead.
Her husband cried , `` Do come to me ,"
but she replied , `` Come thou to me , I can not come to thee"
and he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head.
`` Ah !"
`` I must ,"
`` I will tell you what ,"
`` With all my heart ,"
said Hans , `` but I can tell you , you will have to crawl along with it"
Hans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free.
Never again will I mount it.
What would I not give to have such a cow"
`` Well ,"
Hans agreed with the greatest delight ; the countryman jumped upon the horse , and rode quickly away.
Hans drove his cow quietly before him , and thought over his lucky bargain.
Good heart , what more can I want ?"
Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother 's village.
He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst.
`` I can find a cure for this ,"
thought Hans ; `` I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk"
`` What sort of a trick is this ?"
cried he , and helped the good Hans up.
Hans told him what had happened.
The butcher gave him his flask and said , `` Take a drink and refresh yourself.
`` Well , well ,"
`` Hark ye , Hans ,"
`` Heaven repay you for your kindness !"
Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm.
The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a christening-feast.
`` Just lift her ,"
`` Yes ,"
Meanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other , and shook his head.
`` Look here ,"
he said at length , `` it may not be all right with your pig.
I fear -- I fear that you have got hold of it there.
The good Hans was terrified.
`` Goodness !"
`` I shall risk something at that game ,"
answered the lad , `` but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble"
So he took the cord in his hand , and drove away the pig quickly along a by-path.
The good Hans , free from care , went homewards with the goose under his arm.
`` When I think over it properly ,"
How glad my mother will be !"
`` Yes ,"
answered the scissors-grinder , `` the trade has a golden foundation.
But where did you buy that fine goose ?"
`` I did not buy it , but exchanged my pig for it"
`` And the pig ?"
`` That I got for a cow"
`` And the cow ?"
`` I took that instead of a horse"
`` And the horse ?"
`` For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head"
`` And the gold ?"
`` Well , that was my wages for seven years ' service"
`` You have known how to look after yourself each time ,"
said the grinder.
`` How shall I manage that ?"
said Hans.
`` How can you ask ?"
answered Hans.
and he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange.
`` Now ,"
Take it with you and keep it carefully"
`` I must have been born with a caul ,"
he cried ; `` everything I want happens to me just as if I were a Sunday-child"
Meanwhile , as he had been on his legs since daybreak , he began to feel tired.
`` There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I ,"
he cried out.
He was a Dane , a traveling theater director.
He told me : -LRB- Illustration : THE ANIMATED PUPPETS.
It was wonderful to hear and to see.
All night long I could not go to sleep.
For instance , that a piece of iron that falls through a spiral should become magnetic.
There was some magic in it , or I should certainly have become tipsy.
We drank to my success and clinked our glasses.
It was quite a novel kind of men among whom I now found myself.
The Polytechnic student had fully purified me.
I sat as happy as a king , and went to sleep on the box.
I can put my pieces together just as I please.
On this occasion I chose the general `` moving-day"
But this time I happened to see two children playing in this wilderness of sweepings.
They were playing at `` going to bed ,"
`` It was splendid !"
`` It 's moving-day to-day ,"
` That 's a stupid affair with yonder fir tree , ' said the potsherds.
You see , potsherds think everything is stupid.
-LRB- Illustration : THE REJECTED TRAVELLER.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` There are the good people below , playing at ` changing houses.
`` Just cast your mind 's eye into that great omnibus.
Thus too , there was a Louis XI.
Any day , any how , any minute , the omnibus may draw up.
Then says the mother to the daughter , `` Go into the garden , and chase the hare away"
The girl will not do it.
The maiden refuses.
The third day the hare comes again , and eats the cabbages.
Says the maiden , `` Sh-sh , little hare , you are still eating all our cabbages"
Then all the wedding-guests assembled.
The girl , however , was sad , for she was all alone.
The bride says nothing , but weeps.
The little hare goes away.
The bride again says nothing , and weeps.
The little hare goes away.
and gets up , and strikes the doll on the head so that her cap falls off.
Then the little hare sees that it is not his bride , and goes away and is sorrowful"
`` What sayst thou churl , ` not much ?"
' And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish.
`` What ought I to say , then ?"
asked the youth.
`` Thou must say , ` Get it full , get it full.
'"
Then said he , `` Good morning ; get it full , get it full"
And he again got some blows on his back.
`` What am I to say , then ?"
said he.
`` Thou must say , may God have pity on the poor soul"
Then he came to a pit by which stood a knacker who was cutting up a horse.
The youth said , `` Good morning ; God have pity on the poor soul !"
`` What dost thou say , thou ill-tempered knave ?"
`` What am I to say , then ?"
`` Thou must say , ` There lies the carrion in the pit ! '"
She was , however , good and pious.
and went onwards.
and took it off , and gave away that also.
Then she gathered together the money into this , and was rich all the days of her life"
And when she got to her , Frau Trude said , `` Why art thou so pale ?"
`` Ah ,"
`` What hast thou seen ?"
`` I saw a black man on your steps"
`` That was a collier"
`` Then I saw a green man"
`` That was a huntsman"
`` After that I saw a blood-red man"
`` That was a butcher"
`` Oho !"
said she , `` then thou hast seen the witch in her proper costume.
Then she changed the girl into a block of wood , and threw it into the fire.
On the second and on the third day , it came also exactly in the same way.
said he , neither did he know to whom it could belong.
A louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer in an egg-shell.
Then the little louse fell in and burnt herself.
On this the little flea began to scream loudly.
Then said the little room-door , `` Little flea , why art thou screaming ?"
`` Because the louse has burnt herself"
Then the little door began to creak.
On this a little broom in the corner said , `` Why art thou creaking , little door ?"
`` Have I not reason to creak ?"
`` The little louse has burnt herself , The little flea is weeping"
So the little broom began to sweep frantically.
Then a little cart passed by and said , `` Why art thou sweeping , little broom ?"
`` Have I not reason to sweep ?"
`` The little louse has burnt herself , The little flea is weeping , The little door is creaking"
So the little cart said , `` Then I will run ,"
and began to run wildly.
Then said the ash-heap by which it ran , `` Why art thou running so , little cart ?"
`` Have I not reason to run ?"
The ash-heap said , `` Then I will burn furiously ,"
and began to burn in clear flames.
A little tree stood near the ash-heap and said , `` Ash-heap , why art thou burning ?"
`` Have I not reason to burn ?"
The little tree said , `` Then I will shake myself ,"
`` Have I not reason to shake myself ?"
On this the girl said , `` Then I will break my little water-pitcher ,"
and she broke her little water-pitcher.
`` Have I not reason to break my water-jug ?"
`` Oh , ho !"
said the spring , `` then I will begin to flow ,"
and began to flow violently.
One fine winter 's day person_0 Coon came upon the queerest tracks in the snow.
But these were six times as big as bear tracks.
And person_0 felt a shiver of fear run up and down his back.
He followed the trail a little way.
But he was very careful.
The great tracks led straight toward Farmer Green 's house.
And person_0 did not want to go there.
So he hurried home to ask his mother what he had found.
Mrs.
Coon listened to person_0 's story.
`` I think it must be the monster that almost caught me in the road last summer ,"
said person_0 , meaning the automobile that had given him a great fright.
`` Maybe he 's come back again to catch Farmer Green and his family.
Do you suppose he 's eaten them up ?"
Mrs.
Coon was puzzled.
And she was somewhat alarmed , too.
She wanted to see those strange tracks herself.
It was not often that he could show his mother anything.
And he was so proud that he almost forgot his fright.
`` I guess you 're glad I have sharp eyes ,"
he said , as they hurried along.
his mother told him.
Mrs.
Coon never liked to hear her children boast.
She knew that boasting is one of the most unpleasant things anyone can do.
`` Well -- maybe you do n't think I saw the monster 's tracks at all ,"
said person_0.
`` Maybe you do n't think I heard him screech --"
`` When did you hear him screech ?"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
`` This is the first you 've said about SCREECHING.
When was it ?"
`` Last summer ,"
person_0 answered.
Mrs.
Coon did n't smile.
Perhaps she was too worried for that.
`` It may not be the same monster ,"
she said.
`` It may not be a monster at all"
But by this time person_0 was sure he was right.
He was sure he knew more than his mother.
`` Why ca n't we go right over to Farmer Green 's and take some of his chickens ?"
he asked.
`` The monster has probably eaten him by this time , and all his family , too"
But Mrs.
Coon would do no such thing.
`` Show me the tracks ,"
she said firmly.
And so they went on into the woods.
`` There they are !"
person_0 cried , a few minutes later.
`` See , Mother ! They 're even bigger than I said"
He heard a funny noise behind him , then.
`` Those are Farmer Green 's tracks ,"
she said , as soon as she could stop laughing long enough to speak.
`` What -- as big as that ?"
person_0 pointed at the huge prints in the snow.
`` Snowshoes !"
Mrs.
Coon said.
So that was all there was to person_0 's monster.
Somehow , he was disappointed.
But he was very glad he had said nothing to Jasper Jay about his strange animal.
For if he had , he knew he would never have heard the last of it.
And person_0 was glad about another thing , too.
He felt very happy that his mother had not let him go after Farmer Green 's chickens"
`` Oh , Mother ! What is it ?"
he cried.
`` The loggers have come ,"
Mrs.
Coon said.
`` They are cutting down all the big trees in the swamp"
`` Then we 'll have to move , wo n't we ?"
Fatty asked.
`` No ! They wo n't touch this tree ,"
his mother told him.
`` It 's an old tree , and hollow -- so they wo n't chop it down.
It 's only the good sound trees that they 'll take"
`` But I thought this was a good tree"
Fatty was puzzled.
`` So it is , my son ! It 's a good tree for us.
But not for the loggers.
They would have little use for it"
Fatty Coon felt better when he heard that.
But he took care that they should not see HIM.
He knew what their bright axes could do.
When night came Fatty had still more fun.
The fire was out.
And the pan rested on a stump close beside it.
Fatty Coon climbed up and crawled right inside the pan.
Fatty had jumped to one side , when the tin pan fell.
But no one stirred.
And then Fatty jumped plump into the ashes.
Fatty stood in them for not more than three seconds , but that was quite long enough.
The bottoms of his feet burned as if a hundred hornets had stung them.
He stood first on one foot and then on another.
If you could have seen him you would have thought Fatty was dancing.
And you might have laughed , because he looked funny.
But Fatty Coon did not laugh.
In fact , he came very near crying.
And he did not wait to eat another mouthful.
He limped along toward home.
And it was several days before he stirred out of his mother 's house again.
He just lay in his bed and waited until his burns were well again.
It was very hard.
And he hoped the loggers would not go away before his feet were well again"
So one day he led his brother person_1 over to the old hollow sycamore.
His sisters , Fluffy and Cutey , wanted to go too.
But person_0 would not let them.
`` Girls ca n't be barbers ,"
he said.
And of course they could find no answer to that.
Each of them wanted to use his own tail for the barber 's pole.
They could n't both stick their tails through the hole in the tree at the same time.
So they finally agreed to take turns.
And you know it is n't wise to run any such risk as that.
person_0 offered to cut person_1 's hair.
So person_1 would n't let person_0 touch him.
But HE offered to cut person_0 's hair -- what there was left of it.
`` No , thank you !"
said person_0.
`` I only get my hair cut once a month"
Of course , he had never had his hair cut except that once , in his whole life.
`` I wo n't !"
said person_0.
`` I 'm going to stay here just as long as I please"
And he tried to pull his tail out of the hole.
He wanted to get it out now.
`` Go out and see what 's the matter !"
he cried to person_1.
But person_1 would n't stir.
He was afraid to leave the shelter of the hollow tree.
`` It may be a bear that has hold of your tail ,"
he told person_0.
And somehow , that idea made person_0 tremble all over.
`` Oh , dear ! oh , dear !"
he wailed.
`` What shall I do ? Oh ! whatever shall I do ?"
He began to cry.
And person_1 cried too.
Even if she were at home she could never hear him calling from inside the tree.
So person_0 gave up all hope of her helping.
`` Please , Mr.
Bear , let go of my tail !"
he cried , when he could stand the pain no longer.
And that surprised him.
person_0 and person_1 scrambled out of the hollow sycamore.
person_0 looked all around.
But there was no bear to be seen anywhere -- no one but his mother.
`` Did you frighten the bear away , Mother ?"
he asked.
`` There was no bear ,"
Mrs.
Coon told him.
`` And it 's lucky for you that there was n't.
Now , do n't ever do such a foolish thing again.
Just think what a fix you would have been in if Johnnie Green had come along.
He could have caught you just as easily as anything"
person_0 Coon was so glad to be free once more that he promised to be good forever after.
And he was just as good as any little coon could be -- all the rest of that day"
One night person_0 Coon was strolling along the road that wound through the valley.
There were no farmers driving along the road.
person_0 had it all to himself.
And so he walked slowly homewards.
It was then that the terrible monster almost caught him.
This is how it all happened.
There was a br-br-br-r-r-r in the air.
person_0 really should have heard it long before he did.
And when at last person_0 heard that br - r-r-r it was quite loud.
He was startled.
And he stopped right in the middle of the road to listen.
person_0 had never heard such a sound before.
The strange animal was on him before he knew it.
Its glaring eyes blinded him.
And if it had not screamed at him person_0 would never have escaped.
It was the terrible screech of the monster which finally made person_0 jump.
It was a frightful cry -- like six wildcats all wailing together.
And person_0 leaped to one side of the road just before the monster reached him.
The great creature went past person_0 like the wind and tore on up the hill.
He seemed to be running so fast that he could not stop.
person_0 could hear him panting as he climbed the sharp rise of the road.
person_0 Coon hurried away.
He wanted to get home before the monster could stop and come back to look for him.
When person_0 told his mother about his narrow escape Mrs.
Coon became much excited.
Mrs.
Coon and person_0 climbed to the very top of their old poplar and gazed down the valley.
`` Look , Mother !"
person_0 cried.
`` He 's stopped at Farmer Green 's ! You can see his eyes from here !"
Mrs.
Coon looked.
Sure enough ! It was just as person_0 said.
And that horrid call echoed across the valley once more.
`` Where 's the nearest village , please ?"
the stranger asked.
And after Farmer Green had told him the man drove his car on again.
From their tree-top person_0 and his mother watched the monster dash down the valley.
They knew he had gone , because they could see the gleam of those awful eyes.
`` Do you suppose he ate up Farmer Green and his family ?"
person_0 asked in a frightened voice.
`` I hope so ,"
she said.
`` Then perhaps there 'll be no more traps in the woods"
`` But who would plant the corn ?"
person_0 asked.
Mrs.
Coon did not appear to hear his question"
Fatty loved to eat.
Yes -- he loved eating better than anything else in the world.
That was what made him so fat.
And that , too , was what led him into many adventures.
Among them all there was what grown people call `` a strong family resemblance ,"
which is the same thing as saying that they all looked very much alike.
Each of them had a dark brown patch of fur across the face , like a mask.
Coon , for she was so much bigger than her children.
Mrs.
Coon 's home was in the hollow branch of an old tree.
Coon 's home was as big as most tree-trunks are.
And Cutey was the other sister 's name , because she was so quaint.
Now , Fatty Coon was forever looking around for something to eat.
He was never satisfied with what his mother brought home for him.
No matter how big a dinner Mrs.
Sometimes he went over to the swamp and hunted for duck among the tall reeds.
He ate everything.
And he always wanted more.
`` Is this all there is ?"
Fatty Coon asked his mother one day.
He had gobbled up every bit of the nice fish that Mrs.
Coon had brought home for him.
It was gone in no time at all.
Mrs.
Coon sighed.
`` Yes -- that 's all ,"
she said , `` and I should think that it was enough for a young coon like you"
Fatty said nothing more.
But person_0 made up his mind that he would do the best he could.
He would visit the cornfield every night and feast on those sweet , tender kernels.
The very next night person_0 set out toward Farmer Green 's.
It was hardly dark.
But person_0 could not wait any longer.
He could not even wait for his mother and his sisters and his brother.
He hurried away alone.
And when he came in sight of the cornfield he felt better.
He had been the least bit afraid that the corn might be gone.
person_0 felt very happy as he slipped through the rail-fence.
I would n't dare say how many ears of corn person_0 ate that night.
A dog barked.
And that spoiled person_0 's fun.
For the dog was altogether too near for person_0 to feel safe.
He even dropped the ear of corn he was gnawing and hurried toward the woods.
It was lucky for person_0 that he started when he did.
For that dog was close behind him in no time.
person_0 looked down at the dog and scolded a little.
He was not afraid.
But it made him cross to be driven out of the cornfield.
And he wished the dog would go away.
When Farmer Green saw person_0 he seemed disappointed.
`` He 's too young to bother with ,"
he said.
`` His skin 's not worth much.
We 'll go ` long and see what we can find"
But Johnnie Green stayed behind.
He wanted that young coon.
And he intended to have him , too.
Leaving the young dog to watch person_0 Coon , Johnnie went back to the farmhouse.
After a while he appeared again with an axe over his shoulder.
And when he began to chop away at the big oak , person_0 Coon felt very uneasy.
Whenever Johnnie drove his axe into the tree , both the tree and person_0 shivered together.
And person_0 began to wish he had stayed away from the cornfield.
He looked up longingly at person_0 Coon.
And Johnnie started to climb the tree himself.
But the higher he climbed , the higher person_0 climbed.
And Johnnie knew that he could never catch that plump young coon in that way.
At last Johnnie Green started off , calling his dog after him.
And then person_0 Coon came down.
But he did not go back to the cornfield.
He decided that he had had adventures enough for one night.
But person_0 had learned something -- at least he thought he had.
TREES COULD NOT BE CHOPPED DOWN ! That was what person_0 believed.
Perhaps you will know , later , whether person_0 ever found out that he was mistaken"
Of course it was something to eat -- the surprise.
You must have guessed that , knowing person_0 Coon as you do.
`` Come , children !"
Mrs.
Coon said.
`` Come with me ! I 'm going to give you a treat -- something specially nice"
`` Is it something to eat ?"
person_0 asked , as they started off in the direction of Farmer Green 's fields.
`` Yes -- and the best thing you ever tasted ,"
Mrs.
Coon said.
person_0 was greatly excited.
His little bright eyes turned green in the moonlight.
He wondered what the surprise would be.
And , as usual , he was very hungry.
But you must not forget that person_0 was greedy.
And greedy people are not thoughtful of others.
When Mrs.
`` Here we are !"
said his mother.
person_0 looked about him.
person_0 grunted.
He was very impolite , you see.
`` Well -- what is there to eat that 's so fine ?"
he asked.
`` This stuff is n't good.
It 's like eating reeds"
He had already bitten into one of the stalks.
`` What do you call that ?"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
She showed person_0 a long roll of green that grew out of one of the stalks.
`` That 's something like a cattail ,"
said person_0.
`` It is n't good to eat"
`` Have you ever tried one ?"
asked his mother.
`` N -- no ,"
Patty said.
`` But Freddie Bluejay told me they were n't good"
`` He did , did he ?"
Mrs.
Coon said nothing more.
In a jiffy she had torn it from its stalk.
And then she stripped the green covering off it.
`` Try that !"
said Mrs.
Coon with a smile.
Of course it was person_0 who tasted it first.
He took a good mouthful of the white kernels , and he was overjoyed.
Such sweetness ! Such delicious , milky juice ! It was a moment that person_0 never forgot.
`` What 's its name , Mother ?"
he inquired.
`` Corn , my child"
`` Well , why does n't Freddie Bluejay like it ?"
person_0 asked.
`` He 's probably very fond of corn ,"
said Mrs.
Coon.
`` I 'd like to ,"
said person_0 , with a sigh.
`` I 'd like to eat all the corn in the world"
But he did n't think that THAT was much.
He did n't seem to have much luck , down on the ground.
Fatty loved to climb trees.
Up in the big hemlock he forgot , for a time , that he was still hungry.
He climbed almost to the very tip-top of the tree and wound himself around the straight stem.
The thick , springy branches held him safely , and soon Fatty was fast asleep.
Next to eating , Fatty loved sleeping.
And now he had a good nap.
He was terribly hungry now.
And he felt that he simply MUST find something to eat at once.
Pretty soon Fatty smiled.
He smiled because he was pleased.
And he was pleased because he saw exactly what he had been looking for.
And he began to eat them hungrily.
His nose became smeared with egg , but he did n't mind that at all.
There was a sudden rush through the branches of the tall tree.
And Fatty Coon caught a hard blow on his head.
He felt something sharp sink into his back , too.
And he clutched at the edge of the nest to keep from falling.
And he was frightened , because his back hurt.
There was nothing to do but run home as fast as he could.
He began to think he would never reach home.
But at last he came to the old poplar where his mother lived.
He was glad , because he knew that no crow could follow him down there.
Mrs.
Coon waked up.
`` What on earth is the matter ?"
she exclaimed.
Poor Fatty told her.
`` What color were those eggs ?"
Mrs.
Coon inquired.
`` White !"
said Fatty.
`` Ah , ha !"
Mrs.
Coon said.
And a goshawk is the fiercest of all the hawks there are.
It 's no wonder your back is clawed.
Come here and let me look at it"
Fatty Coon felt quite proud , as his mother examined the marks of the goshawk 's cruel claws.
He only wished there had been a dozen of them"
For once Fatty Coon was not hungry.
He was strolling homewards through the woods when someone called to him.
It was Jimmy Rabbit.
`` Where are you going , Fatty ?"
Jimmy Rabbit asked.
`` Home !"
said Fatty.
`` Are you hungry ?"
Jimmy Rabbit asked anxiously.
`` I should say not !"
Fatty answered.
`` I 've just had the finest meal I ever ate in my life"
Jimmy Rabbit seemed to be relieved to hear that.
`` Come on over and play ,"
he said.
`` All right !"
said Fatty.
`` What do you need me for ?"
Fatty asked , as he trudged along beside Jimmy Rabbit.
`` We need you for the barber 's pole ,"
Jimmy explained.
`` You can come inside the hollow tree and stick your tail out through a hole.
Fatty Coon was greatly pleased.
He looked around at his tail and felt very proud.
`` I 've got a beautiful tail -- have n't I ?"
he asked.
`` Um -- yes !"
But come along ! There may be people waiting to get their hair cut"
Squirrel 's head.
`` How much do you charge for a hair-cut ?"
Fatty asked.
`` Oh , that depends !"
Jimmy Rabbit said.
`` Mr.
Squirrel will pay us six cabbage leaves.
But if we were to cut your hair we 'd have to ask more.
We 'd want a dozen cabbage leaves , at least"
`` Well , do n't I get anything for the use of my tail ?"
Fatty asked.
Jimmy Rabbit and his brother whispered together for a few moments.
`` I 'll tell you what we 'll do ,"
Jimmy said.
Is n't that fair enough ?"
Fatty Coon was satisfied.
But he insisted that Jimmy begin to cut his hair at once.
`` I 'm doing my part of the work now ,"
he pointed out.
`` So there 's no reason why you should n't do yours"
With that Jimmy Rabbit began.
He clipped and snipped at Fatty 's head , pausing now and then to see the effect.
`` Moustache trimmed ?"
Jimmy Rabbit asked , when he had finished with Fatty 's head.
`` Certainly -- of course !"
Fatty Coon answered.
And pretty soon Fatty 's long white moustache lay on the floor of the barber-shop.
`` You have n't cut it too short , I hope ,"
he said.
`` No , indeed !"
Jimmy Rabbit assured him.
`` It 's the very latest style"
`` What on earth has happened to you ?"
Mrs.
Coon cried , -- when Fatty reached home that night.
`` Have you been in a fire ?"
`` It 's the latest style , Mother ,"
Fatty told her.
`` At least , that 's what Jimmy Rabbit says"
He felt the least bit uneasy again.
`` Did you let that Jimmy Rabbit do that to you ?"
Mrs.
Coon asked.
Fatty hung his head.
He said nothing at all.
But his mother knew.
`` Well ! you ARE a sight !"
she exclaimed.
`` It will be months before you look like my child again.
I shall be ashamed to go anywhere with you"
Fatty Coon felt very foolish.
And there was just one thing that kept him from crying.
But when the next day came , Fatty could n't find Jimmy Rabbit and his brother anywhere.
They kept out of sight.
But they had told all the other forest-people about the trick they had played on Fatty Coon.
And everywhere Fatty went he heard nothing but hoots and jeers and laughs.
He felt very silly.
And he wished that he might meet Jimmy Rabbit and his brother"
The winter was fast going.
person_0 was much thinner than he had been in the fall.
He had spent so much of the time sleeping that he had really eaten very little.
And now he hardly knew himself as he looked at his sides.
They no longer stuck out as they had once.
The ground was covered with snow.
And looking at those tracks only made him hungrier than ever.
For a few minutes person_0 thought deeply.
And then he turned about and went straight toward Farmer Green 's place.
As person_0 passed a small , low building he noticed a delicious smell.
And he stopped right there.
He had gone far enough.
The door was open a little way.
There was a long row of hams hung up in a line.
But the fires were out , now ; and person_0 was in no danger of being burned.
The hams were what person_0 Coon had smelled.
And the hams were what person_0 intended to eat.
But when it came to eating , person_0 's courage never failed him.
He would have tried to eat an elephant , if he had had the chance.
person_0 did not stop to look long at that row of hams.
He stopped at the very first ham he came to.
There was no sense in going any further.
person_0 could not eat fast enough.
He wished he had two mouths -- he was so hungry.
But he did very well , with only ONE.
In no time at all he had made a great hole in the ham.
And he had no idea of stopping.
But he did stop.
He stopped very suddenly.
For the first thing he knew , something threw him right down upon the floor.
And the ham fell on top of him and nearly knocked him senseless.
But he was terribly frightened.
person_0 swallowed a whole mouthful of ashes as he dashed across the barnyard.
And he never stopped running until he was almost home.
He was puzzled.
`` It was some sort of trap , probably ,"
Mrs.
Coon said.
But for once Mrs.
Coon was mistaken.
It was very simple.
person_0 's children thought it very exciting.
It was their favorite story.
And they made their father tell it over and over again"
After his adventure with the goshawk Fatty Coon did not go near the tree-tops for a long time.
Somehow , he felt safer on the ground.
Fatty had been looking for frogs , but he had had no luck at all.
He wished he might find a frog.
But not one frog appeared.
And then he forgot all about frogs.
Yes ! Frogs passed completely out of Fatty Coon 's mind.
For whom should he spy but Mrs.
She was swimming toward the bank where Fatty was hidden.
Mrs.
Turtle stopped then ; and for a few minutes she was very busy about something.
First she dug a hole in the sand.
And Fatty wondered what she was looking for.
But he kept very quiet.
And after a time Mrs.
Turtle splashed into the creek again and paddled away.
But before she left she scooped sand into the hole she had dug.
She seemed to have a secret.
Fatty Coon had grown very curious , as he watched Mrs.
Turtle.
He went straight to the spot where Mrs.
Turtle had dug the hole and filled it up again.
Turtle had dug before him.
It took Fatty Coon only about six seconds to discover Mrs.
Turtle 's secret.
Turtle had left there in the warm sand to hatch.
THAT was why she looked all around to make sure that no one saw her.
THAT was why she seemed so pleased.
For Mrs.
But it never happened that way at all.
They were delicious.
And as he finished the last one he could n't help thinking how lucky he had been"
`` Be quiet , my child ,"
said the old woman , `` and thou shalt have it.
When daylight comes , and she sees what she has done , we shall be lost"
`` But ,"
Then she hurried away with her lover.
Then the witch cried , `` Where art thou ?"
`` Here , on the stairs , I am sweeping ,"
answered the first drop of blood.
`` Here in the kitchen , I am warming myself ,"
cried the second drop of blood.
She went into the kitchen , but found no one.
Then she cried again , `` Where art thou ?"
`` Ah , here in the bed , I am sleeping"
cried the third drop of blood.
She went into the room to the bed.
`` That shall not serve you ,"
`` Oh , yes ,"
he replied , `` I will play to you while you do it"
`` Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait for thee ,"
From that time forth , strange things happened in the shepherd 's house.
Swiftly he sprang towards it , and threw a white cloth over it.
The man said , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am God"
`` Then I do not desire to have thee for a godfather ,"
said the man ; `` thou givest to the rich , and leavest the poor to hunger"
Thus spoke the man , for he did not know how wisely God apportions riches and poverty.
He turned therefore away from the Lord , and went farther.
The man asked , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am the Devil"
`` Then I do not desire to have thee for godfather ,"
said the man ; `` thou deceivest men and leadest them astray"
The man asked , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am person_0 , and I make all equal"
The man said , `` Next Sunday is the christening ; be there at the right time"
person_0 appeared as he had promised , and stood godfather quite in the usual way.
I make thee a celebrated physician.
When thou art called to a patient , I will always appear to thee.
But beware of using the herb against my will , or it might fare ill with thee"
It was not long before the youth was the most famous physician in the whole world.
`` If I could but cheat person_0 for once ,"
Then he gave the King some of the herb , and he recovered and grew healthy again.
Soon afterwards the King 's daughter fell into a severe illness.
When the physician came to the sick girl 's bed , he saw person_0 by her feet.
He raised up the sick girl , and placed her head where her feet had lain.
`` See ,"
said person_0 , `` these are the lights of men 's lives.
`` Show me the light of my life ,"
said the physician , and he thought that it would be still very tall.
`` Ah , dear godfather ,"
`` I can not ,"
answered person_0 , `` one must go out before a new one is lighted"
pleaded the physician.
Immediately the physician fell on the ground , and now he himself was in the hands of person_0"
There was once upon a time a person_0 who had no children.
He replied , `` Fakir , a thousand men have come and passed by ; you pass on too"
But the Fakir said , `` Who are you , man ?"
The person_0 replied , `` I am a person_0 , Fakir.
So I have come here , and have laid me down at the cross-roads.
`` Whatever you ask , Fakir ,"
answered the person_0.
The person_0 took the sweetmeats and put them in his bosom.
The person_0 said , `` Well , I agree"
After some time two sons were born to the person_0.
What did the person_0 do but bring two slave-girls ' sons and present them to the Fakir.
Another stronger ant came up and attacked her in order to get this grain of rice.
Then the person_0 went and brought his own sons.
But the person_0 's son said , `` Master first , and pupil after"
Next he let out all the men who were in prison.
Come , I will fight you"
So they got ready and began to fight , and the person_0 's son threw him.
I appoint the tiger as guard over my property.
And you are my slave , you , too , must stay here with my belongings"
So she said to her father , `` My father ; I wish to marry"
`` Good ,"
said her father.
He went in and sat down.
She noticed that the traveller Prince was sitting in the assembly in Fakir 's attire.
The handmaiden obeyed the Princess 's order , went to him , and sprinkled the scent over him.
Then the people said , `` The slave-girl has made a mistake"
What fate had decreed came to pass in that country , and they were married.
People said , `` What is this Fakir that he should go a-hunting ?"
However , they all set out for the hunt , and fixed their meeting-place at a certain pool.
Instantly they killed and brought in a great number.
Now that person_0 had no son.
Then the new Prince told him that in fact he , too , was a Prince.
`` Good-day , Father Hollenthe"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your daughter ?"
`` Where is Mother Malcho , then ?"
`` She is in the cow-house , milking the cow"
`` Good-day , Mother Malcho"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your daughter ?"
`` Where is Brother High-and-Mighty , then ?"
`` He is in the room chopping some wood"
`` Good-day , Brother High-and-Mighty"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your sister ?"
`` Where is Sister K setraut , then ?"
`` She is in the garden cutting cabbages"
`` Good-day , sister K setraut"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` May I be allowed to have your sister ?"
`` Where is fair Katrinelje , then ?"
`` She is in the room counting out her farthings"
`` Good day , fair Katrinelje"
`` Many thanks , Pif-paf-poltrie"
`` Wilt thou be my bride ?"
`` Fair Katrinelje , how much dowry do hast thou ?"
`` Something better"
`` A shoemaker ?"
`` Something better"
`` A husbandman ?"
`` Something better"
`` A joiner ?"
`` Something better"
`` A smith ?"
`` Something better"
`` A miller ?"
`` Something better"
`` Perhaps a broom-maker ?"
`` Yes , that 's what I am , is it not a fine trade ?"
And they let the poor old man know what they felt.
One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles.
`` Look here , friend ,"
said he.
You will soon find them change their conduct towards you.
Salaam.
I will come again soon to see how you are getting on"
He was kept for a while on bread and water , and then set free again.
When he hit her he laughed , and when he missed her , he stormed and swore.
This went on so long that the neighbors came to the wife 's assistance.
The tailor was again summoned before the magistrates , and reminded of his promise.
`` Dear gentlemen ,"
`` How can that be ,"
said the judge , `` when she continually brings such heavy complaints against you ?"
The judges were not satisfied with this answer , but gave him the reward he deserved"
`` I thank you kindly , little dog , I fare as well as you !"
Old Rhyme.
`` Come in good time , my dear Duchess ,"
said Ribby 's letter , `` and we will have something so very nice.
I am baking it in a pie-dish -- a pie - dish with a pink rim.
wrote Ribby.
But it is very strange.
`` I will come very punctually , my dear Ribby ,"
wrote Duchess ; and then at the end she added -- `` I hope it is n't mouse ?"
And then she thought that did not look quite polite ; so she scratched out `` is n't mouse"
and changed it to `` I hope it will be fine ,"
and she gave her letter to the postman.
`` I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse !"
said Duchess to herself -- `` I really could n't , COULD N'T eat mouse pie.
And I shall have to eat it , because it is a party.
And MY pie was going to be veal and ham.
Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it"
THE FAIR my pages safely may pursue , And this apology they 'll not refuse.
Crowns , jewels , palaces , appeared as naught.
'Twas solely beauteous woman now he sought.
THIS savage , solitary , rustick school , The father chose his infancy to rule.
His partner 's death produced distaste of life , And made him fear to seek another wife.
THE city 's palaces and lofty spires , Our rustick 's bosom filled with new desires.
The prince 's residence great splendor showed , And lively pleasure on the youth bestowed.
person_0.
person_0ill I will give you something"
person_0.
person_0.
Brother Lustig gave him also the third quarter of bread and the third kreuzer.
person_0.
When he had had it , he journeyed onwards , and then person_0.
`` Where am I to procure it ?"
The last quarter I ate in the inn , and had a drink with the last kreuzer.
Now my pockets are empty , and if thou also hast nothing we can go a-begging together"
`` No ,"
answered person_0.
Peter , `` we need not quite do that.
I know a little about medicine , and I will soon earn as much as I require by that"
`` Indeed ,"
said Brother Lustig , `` I know nothing of that , so I must go and beg alone"
`` Just come with me ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` and if I earn anything , thou shalt have half of it"
`` All right ,"
said Brother Lustig , so they went away together.
`` person_0op that howling and crying ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` I will make the man well again ,"
But person_0.
Brother Lustig , however , nudged person_0.
Peter , and said , `` Take something ; sure enough we are in need of it"
At length the woman brought a lamb and said to person_0.
Peter that he really must take that , but he would not.
Then person_0.
`` That is nothing ,"
said Brother Lustig.
`` I will easily carry it ,"
and took it on his shoulder.
`` As you like ,"
answered person_0.
`` Well , go , then ,"
said Brother Lustig , `` I understand cookery , I will manage it"
Then person_0.
`` That is said to be the best part ,"
said he , and tasted it , but at last he ate it all up.
At length person_0.
`` But where can it be ?"
said the apostle.
`` I do n't know ,"
`` Oh ,"
said person_0.
`` No , be assured , my brother ,"
`` Well , it is all right ,"
said person_0.
`` What I ca n't eat now , I will carry away in my knapsack ,"
said Brother Lustig , and he ate half the lamb , and put the rest in his knapsack.
They went farther , and then person_0.
Said person_0.
Peter , `` Do thou go first"
`` No ,"
answered Brother Lustig , `` thou must go first ,"
and he thought , `` if the water is too deep I will stay behind"
Then person_0.
Peter strode through it , and the water just reached to his knee.
Then he cried , `` Brother , help me !"
person_0.
Peter said , `` Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb 's heart ?"
`` No ,"
said he , `` I have not eaten it"
Then the water grew deeper still and rose to his mouth.
`` Help me , brother ,"
cried the soldier.
person_0.
Peter said , `` Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb 's heart ?"
`` No ,"
he replied , `` I have not eaten it"
person_0.
`` Hollo , brother !"
said the soldier to person_0.
But person_0.
said he , `` that we may get there in time"
But person_0.
`` Now we are done for !"
said Brother Lustig ; `` that comes of thy sleepy way of walking !"
`` Just be quiet ,"
answered person_0.
`` Well , if thou canst do that ,"
Then they went to the royal palace , where every one was in great grief , but person_0.
Peter told the King that he would restore his daughter to life.
He was taken to her , and said , `` Bring me a kettle and some water ,"
And at the third time , the princess arose , living , healthy and beautiful.
Then the King was in the greatest joy , and said to person_0.
But person_0.
Peter said , `` I want nothing for it"
`` Oh , thou tomfool !"
person_0.
Then they went on their way , and when they came to a forest , person_0.
Peter said to Brother Lustig , `` Now , we will divide the gold"
`` Yes ,"
he replied , `` we will"
So person_0.
Peter divided the gold , and divided it into three heaps.
But person_0.
`` Oh , I ate that !"
replied Brother Lustig , and hastily swept up the gold.
`` You may trust what I say"
`` But how can that be true ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` when a lamb has no heart ?"
`` Well , so be it ,"
said person_0.
`` As you like , dear brother ,"
answered Brother Lustig.
`` Farewell"
Then person_0.
Then he arrived in a certain country where he heard that a King 's daughter was dead.
`` Oh , ho !"
So he went to the King , and offered to raise the dead girl to life again.
Peter do.
and he said this thrice , but the bones did not stir.
cried he , `` Get up , or it shall be worse for you !"
When he had said that , person_0.
`` Dear brother , I have done everything to the best of my ability ,"
he answered.
Thereupon person_0.
and the King 's daughter arose , healthy and beautiful as before.
Then person_0.
`` I should just like to know ,"
When he got out , person_0.
`` How can I help that ,"
answered Brother Lustig , `` if people will put it in for me ?"
`` Faith ,"
said person_0.
Farewell , thou wilt now never see me more"
`` Good-bye ,"
But of the magical power which had been bestowed on his knapsack , he thought no more.
Brother Lustig traveled about with his money , and squandered and wasted what he had as before.
and ordered three kreuzers ' worth of wine and one kreuzer 's worth of bread for himself.
`` Ah , that 's right !"
said he , `` now I am a made man !"
and went away to a meadow and took out the roast meat.
Brother Lustig thought to himself , `` One is enough for me ,"
The landlord ran thither , and behold the oven was empty ! `` What !"
I looked after him myself ; you are the thieves and shall pay !"
`` It surprises me that they should come to you and not go to that splendid castle ,"
said Brother Lustig.
`` Ah , indeed ,"
`` If others have tried it ,"
said Brother Lustig , `` I will try it too"
`` Leave it alone ,"
said the host , `` it will cost you your neck"
`` It wo n't kill me at once ,"
said Brother Lustig , `` just give me the key , and some good food and wine"
`` person_0op , you devils ' ghosts ,"
said he , but they behaved still worse.
and got the leg of a chair and struck out into the midst of them with it.
`` Devils ' crew ,"
cried he , `` it is getting too bad , but wait.
Into my knapsack , all nine of you !"
`` The reason why they have not ,"
`` No ,"
replied Brother Lustig , `` I am used to wandering about , I will travel farther"
`` I should be a fool ,"
thought Brother Lustig , `` if I were to take the narrow , rough road"
Brother Lustig knocked , and the door-keeper peeped out to see who was there.
He once gave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it"
person_0.
Peter was sitting hard by as door-keeper.
But person_0.
Peter said , `` I really believe that thou wantest to come into Heaven"
`` No ,"
said person_0.
Peter , `` thou shalt not enter"
`` Give it here , then ,"
said person_0.
Peter.
Then Brother Lustig gave him the knapsack into Heaven through the bars , and person_0.
Peter took it , and hung it beside his seat.
Then said Brother Lustig , `` And now I wish myself inside my knapsack ,"
and in a second he was in it , and in Heaven , and person_0.
Peter was forced to let him stay there"
Now person_0 felt very sorry for the poor tortoise and made up his mind to rescue it.
Here , boys , go on , go on !"
And they began to treat the poor tortoise more cruelly than ever.
`` No , we wo n't give you the tortoise ,"
said one of the boys.
`` Why should we ? We caught it ourselves"
`` What you say is true ,"
said person_0 , `` but I do not ask you to give it to me for nothing.
Wo n't that do for you , my boys ?"
`` Look , boys , you can buy anything you like with this money.
You can do much more with this money than you can with that poor tortoise.
See what good boys you are to listen to me"
as they say in Japan.
Luckily I was passing by and saved you , and so life is still yours.
Now I am going to take you back to your home , the sea , at once.
The next morning person_0 went out as usual in his boat.
He was suddenly startled from his reverie by hearing his own name called : `` person_0 , person_0 !"
Clear as a bell and soft as the summer wind the name floated over the sea.
person_0 saw with surprise that it was the very tortoise he had rescued the day before.
`` Well , Mr.
Tortoise ,"
said person_0 , `` was it you who called my name just now ?"
The tortoise nodded its head several times and said : `` Yes , it was I.
`` Indeed ,"
said person_0 , `` that is very polite of you.
Come up into the boat.
I would offer you a smoke , but as you are a tortoise doubtless you do not smoke ,"
and the fisherman laughed at the joke.
`` He-he-he-he !"
`` Indeed ,"
said person_0 , `` I regret very much that I have no `` sake"
It must be very far away , if it exists at all !"
If you would like to see the Sea King 's land I will be your guide"
If you will ride on my back I will take you without any trouble on your part"
`` But ,"
said person_0 , `` how is it possible for me to ride on your small back ?"
`` It may seem absurd to you.
but I assure you that you can do so.
`` This is strange indeed !"
said person_0 ; `` then.
Mr.
Tortoise , with your kind permission I will get on your back.
Dokoisho !"
-LRB- Footnote : `` All right"
-LRB- only used by lower classes -RRB-.
-RRB- he exclaimed as he jumped on.
and with these words he leapt into the sea with person_0 on his back.
Down through the water the tortoise dived.
For a long time these two strange companions rode through the sea.
person_0 never grew tired , nor his clothes moist with the water.
`` Ya"
exclaimed person_0.
`` that looks like the gate of some large palace just appearing ! Mr.
Tortoise , can you tell what that place is we can now see ?"
`` Then we have at last come to the realm of the Sea King and to his Palace ,"
said person_0.
`` Yes , indeed ,"
answered the tortoise , `` and do n't you think we have come very quickly ?"
And while he was speaking the tortoise reached the side of the gate.
`` And here we are , and you must please walk from here"
I have had the honor of bringing him as a visitor to this kingdom.
Please show him the way"
Thrice welcome are you , having come from such a distant country.
And you , Mr.
Tortoise , we are greatly indebted to you for all your trouble in bringing person_0 here"
Then , turning again to person_0 , they said , `` Please follow us this way ,"
and from here the whole band of fishes became his guides.
When he reached the portals a beautiful Princess with her attendant maidens came out to welcome him.
person_0 was lost in wonder while he looked upon her , and he could not speak.
`` person_0 Taro , it gives me the highest pleasure to welcome you to my father 's kingdom ,"
said the Princess.
Beyond all words , this is the most wonderful place I have ever seen"
While he was speaking a train of fishes appeared , all dressed in ceremonial , trailing garments.
person_0 enjoyed himself with all his heart.
Never in his whole life had he sat down to such a marvelous feast.
But , to person_0 , more wonderful than the palace was the garden that surrounded it.
I must go back at once without letting one more day pass"
And he began to prepare for the journey in great haste.
But now I must say good-by.
I must go back to my old parents"
Do not think that I wish to leave you.
It is not that.
I must go and see my old parents.
Let me go for one day and I will come back to you"
`` Then ,"
said the Princess sorrowfully , `` there is nothing to be done.
and then he added : `` Tell me what is this box ?"
`` That ,"
And person_0 promised that he would never , never open the box whatever happened.
Wondering what it can mean he walks quickly towards his old home.
and he was about to enter , when he saw a strange man coming out.
`` Perhaps my parents have moved while I have been away , and have gone somewhere else ,"
was the fisherman 's thought.
Somehow he began to feel strangely anxious , he could not tell why.
`` Excuse me ,"
My name is person_0 Taro.
Where have my parents gone whom I left here ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the fisherman , `` I am person_0 Taro !"
`` Ha , ha !"
laughed the man , `` you must not make such jokes.
He could not possibly be alive now !"
I am really person_0 Taro , and I certainly have not lived three hundred years.
Till four or five days ago I lived on this spot.
Tell me what I want to know without more joking , please"
Perhaps you are his spirit come to revisit your old home ?"
`` Why do you mock me ?"
said person_0.
`` I am no spirit ! I am a living man -- do you not see my feet ;"
and `` don-don ,"
-LRB- Japanese ghosts have no feet.
person_0 was lost in bewilderment and trouble.
He seemed to be in a strange dream.
There was no use in staying here any longer.
He must get back to his beautiful wife beyond the sea.
There is nothing else for me to do now.
Yes , yes , I will open the box and look in !"
There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in wait.
`` Well ,"
I have certainly money enough"
Nevertheless , the real reason was that he had caught sight of the pretty girl.
He entered the house , and was well received and courteously entertained.
She did so , saying , `` Now , my dearest , drink to me"
The girl answered , `` We will leave him that , he has lost his wealth"
I must and will have it !"
The huntsman asked , `` Why dost thou stand there so sorrowfully ?"
`` Ah , my beloved ,"
was her answer , `` over yonder lies the Garnet Mountain , where the precious stones grow.
`` Hast thou nothing else to complain of ?"
said the huntsman.
`` I will soon remove that burden from thy heart"
Then they sat down , and he laid his head in her lap , and fell asleep.
and sat down there in care and sorrow , not knowing what to do.
The second said , `` Step upon him and kill him"
So saying they passed by.
Then the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue.
After wandering about for a couple of days he was lucky enough to find it again.
said he , `` that I can go no further"
The witch asked , `` Who are you , countryman , and what is your business ?"
`` Why not ?"
and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad cabbage.
The huntsman thought , `` The salad must have already taken effect ,"
and said , `` I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it"
`` All right ,"
said he , `` the two have taken their portion ,"
`` I bring you the delicate food myself ,"
said he , `` in order that you may not have to wait longer"
`` I have three unmanageable beasts ,"
answered he , `` which I do n't want to keep any longer.
The miller said , `` Why not ? But how am I to manage them ?"
After that he went back into the castle , and found therein everything he needed.
So the wedding was celebrated , and they lived happily together until their death"
Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children.
The boy was called Hansel and the girl Grethel.
`` I 'll tell you what , husband ,"
They will not find the way home again , and we shall be rid of them"
`` No , wife ,"
`` O , thou fool !"
and she left him no peace until he consented.
`` But I feel very sorry for the poor children , all the same ,"
said the man.
Grethel wept bitter tears , and said to Hansel , `` Now all is over with us"
`` Be quiet , Grethel ,"
said Hansel , `` do not distress thyself , I will soon find a way to help us"
and he lay down again in his bed.
Grethel took the bread under her apron , as Hansel had the stones in his pocket.
Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.
`` Ah , father ,"
Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood together , as high as a little hill.
When we have done , we will come back and fetch you away"
When at last they awoke , it was already dark night.
Grethel began to cry and said , `` How are we to get out of the forest now ?"
The children were , however , still awake and had heard the conversation.
Early in the morning came the woman , and took the children out of their beds.
`` Hansel , why dost thou stop and look round ?"
said the father , `` go on"
answered Hansel.
`` Simpleton !"
Hansel , however , little by little , threw all the crumbs on the path.
Hansel said to Grethel , `` We shall soon find the way ,"
but they did not find it.
It was now three mornings since they had left their father 's house.
`` We will set to work on that ,"
said Hansel , `` and have a good meal.
The children answered , `` The wind , the wind , The heaven-born wind ,"
and went on eating without disturbing themselves.
Hansel and Grethel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.
No harm shall happen to you"
She took them both by the hand , and led them into her little house.
He might scream as he liked , that was of no use.
When he is fat , I will eat him"
And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel , but Grethel got nothing but crab-shells.
`` Hola , Grethel ,"
she cried to the girl , `` be active , and bring some water.
Let Hansel be fat or lean , to-morrow I will kill him , and cook him"
she cried.
`` Just keep thy noise to thyself ,"
said the old woman , `` all that wo n't help thee at all"
`` We will bake first ,"
said the old woman , `` I have already heated the oven , and kneaded the dough"
She pushed poor Grethel out to the oven , from which flames of fire were already darting.
`` Creep in ,"
`` Silly goose ,"
and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven.
Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it.
`` These are far better than pebbles !"
and filled her pinafore full.
`` But now we will go away"
said Hansel , `` that we may get out of the witch 's forest"
When they had walked for two hours , they came to a great piece of water.
`` We can not get over ,"
said Hansel , `` I see no foot-plank , and no bridge"
`` And no boat crosses either ,"
`` No ,"
Then all anxiety was at an end , and they lived together in perfect happiness.
It guided him to a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes.
`` Who are you , and what do you want ?"
asked the man in a grumbling voice.
`` I am a poor tailor ,"
`` Go your way ,"
A violent sound of screaming and roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut.
It seemed , however , to him just as if he were flying away.
His courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order.
The stone began to give way under his feet , and sank slowly down into the depths.
Here , however , there was more to look at and to admire.
It ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite.
`` Just Heaven !"
On the self - same day when they end , shall thy happiness begin.
I passed the night in the greatest disquietude , and only fell asleep towards morning.
`` I at once suspected nothing good.
Instead of answering me , he began to laugh loudly.
I fell to the ground , and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness.
I answered him as little as I had done the first time.
He vanished and left me in my prison , in which a deep sleep came on me.
Help me to accomplish the other things which happened in those visions.
for he was afraid.
thought he.
`` That , too , must be an art of which I understand nothing"
Look how thy brother works , but thou dost not even earn thy salt"
`` Well , father ,"
I do n't understand that at all yet"
He who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes"
`` Just think ,"
`` If that be all ,"
replied the sexton , `` he can learn that with me.
Send him to me , and I will soon polish him"
The sexton therefore took him into his house , and he had to ring the bell.
`` Thou shalt soon learn what shuddering is ,"
`` Who is there ?"
cried he , but the figure made no reply , and did not move or stir.
`` Give an answer ,"
cried the boy , `` or take thy self off , thou hast no business here at night"
The sexton , however , remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost.
The sexton thought , `` he ca n't intend to be as bad as his words ,"
uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone.
`` No , I do n't know ,"
I should be sorry if it were"
She carried him down , and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy 's father.
`` Your boy ,"
Take the good-for-nothing fellow away from our house"
The father was terrified , and ran thither and scolded the boy.
`` What wicked tricks are these ?"
said he , `` the devil must have put this into thy head"
`` Father ,"
he replied , `` do listen to me.
I am quite innocent.
He was standing there by night like one who is intending to do some evil.
`` Ah ,"
said the father , `` I have nothing but unhappiness with you.
Go out of my sight.
I will see thee no more"
`` Yes , father , right willingly , wait only until it is day.
`` Learn what thou wilt ,"
spake the father , `` it is all the same to me.
Here are fifty thalers for thee.
`` Yes , father , it shall be as you will.
If you desire nothing more than that , I can easily keep it in mind"
Sit down below it , and wait till night comes , and you will soon learn how to shudder"
`` If that is all that is wanted ,"
Just come back to me early in the morning"
Then the youth went to the gallows , sat down below it , and waited till evening came.
But they sat there and did not stir , and the fire caught their clothes.
So he said , `` Take care , or I will hang you up again"
and he hung them up again each in his turn.
`` No ,"
A waggoner who was striding behind him heard that and asked , `` Who are you ?"
`` I do n't know ,"
answered the youth.
Then the waggoner asked , `` From whence comest thou ?"
`` I know not"
`` Who is thy father ?"
`` That I may not tell thee"
`` What is it that thou art always muttering between thy teeth"
`` Ah ,"
`` Give up thy foolish chatter ,"
said the waggoner.
`` Come , go with me , I will see about a place for thee"
`` Ah , be silent ,"
Already many men had gone into the castle , but as yet none had come out again.
The King had these things carried into the castle for him during the day.
`` Ah , if I could but shudder !"
said he , `` but I shall not learn it here either"
`` You simpletons !"
`` Why not ?"
he replied , `` but just show me your paws"
Then they stretched out their claws.
`` Oh ,"
said he , `` what long nails you have ! Wait , I must first cut them for you"
Thereupon he seized them by the throats , put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast.
`` I have looked at your fingers ,"
said he , `` and my fancy for card-playing has gone ,"
and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water.
and began to cut them down.
Part of them ran away , the others he killed , and threw out into the fish-pond.
When he came back he fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself.
Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner.
`` That is the very thing for me ,"
said he , and got into it.
`` That 's right ,"
said he , `` but go faster"
and lay down by his fire , and slept till it was day.
Then said he , `` After all it is a pity , -- he is a handsome man"
The youth heard it , got up , and said , `` It has not come to that yet"
Then the King was astonished , but very glad , and asked how he had fared.
`` Very well indeed ,"
answered he ; `` one night is past , the two others will get over likewise"
`` No ,"
said he , `` it is all in vain.
If some one would but tell me"
`` Hollo !"
cried he , `` another half belongs to this.
This is too little !"
`` Wait ,"
said he , `` I will just blow up the fire a little for thee"
`` That is no part of our bargain ,"
said the youth , `` the bench is mine"
The youth also wanted to play and said `` Hark you , can I join you ?"
`` Yes , if thou hast any money"
`` Money enough ,"
replied he , `` but your balls are not quite round"
Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round.
`` There , now , they will roll better !"
said he.
`` Hurrah ! Now it goes merrily !"
He lay down and quietly fell asleep.
Next morning the King came to inquire after him.
`` How has it fared with you this time ?"
asked he.
`` I have been playing at nine-pins ,"
he answered , `` and have lost a couple of farthings"
`` Hast thou not shuddered then ?"
`` Eh , what ?"
said he , `` I have made merry.
If I did but know what it was to shudder !"
When it grew late , six tall men came in and brought a coffin.
and he beckoned with his finger , and cried `` Come , little cousin , come"
He felt his face , but it was cold as ice.
`` Stop ,"
said he , `` I will warm thee a little ,"
and carried him to the bed , covered him over and lay down by him.
After a short time the dead man became warm too , and began to move.
Then said the youth , `` See , little cousin , have I not warmed thee ?"
The dead man , however , got up and cried , `` Now will I strangle thee"
`` What !"
and he took him up , threw him into it , and shut the lid.
Then came the six men and carried him away again.
`` I can not manage to shudder ,"
said he.
`` I shall never learn it here as long as I live"
Then a man entered who was taller than all others , and looked terrible.
He was old , however , and had a long white beard.
`` Thou wretch ,"
cried he , `` thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder , for thou shalt die"
`` Not so fast ,"
replied the youth.
`` If I am to die , I shall have to have a say in it"
`` I will soon seize thee ,"
said the fiend.
`` Softly , softly , do not talk so big.
I am as strong as thou art , and perhaps even stronger"
`` We shall see ,"
said the old man.
`` If thou art stronger , I will let thee go -- come , we will try"
`` I can do better than that ,"
said the youth , and went to the other anvil.
`` Now I have thee ,"
said the youth.
`` Now it is thou who will have to die"
The youth drew out the axe and let him go.
`` Of these ,"
`` I shall still be able to find my way out ,"
Next morning the King came and said `` Now thou must have learned what shuddering is ?"
`` No ,"
`` Then ,"
said the King , `` thou hast delivered the castle , and shalt marry my daughter"
`` That is all very well ,"
said he , `` but still I do not know what it is to shudder"
And at last she was angry at this.
His heart was soon the object of the FAIR ; To please Belphegor was their constant care.
No other choice Belphegor now had got , Than -- try himself the hymeneal knot.
The heart alone can tranquilize the mind ; In mutual passion ev ` ry bliss we find.
We daily see from DUTY springs disgust , And PLEASURE likes true LIBERTY to trust.
His utter ruin , howsoe'er , arose From his attorney-steward that he chose.
'Twas said our husband never would succeed ; And truly , such it seemed to be decreed.
Sire , said the demon , it is clearly true , Damnation does the marriage knot pursue.
\* By this character La Fontaine is supposed to have meant his own wife"
To Constance this a thunder-clap appeared ; Howe'er , she in her purpose persevered.
To be confused the wily stripling feigned , And like a statue for a time remained.
BETWEEN the clothes in haste Camillus flew , Without inviting Constance to pursue.
Constance Unlace me then , I pray.
Camillus I can not : I 'm undressed , and cold as clay : Unlace yourself.
THE whole arrangement Nicia much approved ; But now 'twas time the lady should be moved.
LUCRETIA howsoe'er the lad approved ; His winning manners much her favor moved.
The foll ` wing days our youthful am ` rous pair Found opportunities for pleasing fare.
The husband scarcely could himself contain , So anxiously he wished his aim to gain.
PRAY recollect my very life 's at stake , And do not many difficulties make.
But there was no necessity for this ; ` Tis pretty clear that nothing went amiss.
So plausible this prophet 's tale appeared , Each word he dropt was thoroughly revered.
THEN back they bore them motionless to sleep , And wake with wishes further joys to reap.
The holy father then was always prone , To send the servants off and be alone.
BY means of opiate powders , much renowned , The friar plunged him in a sleep profound.
A THING so strange filled numbers with surprise , Who scarcely would believe their ears and eyes.
ONE day , to William 's castle as he moved.
TO their proposal Reynold soon agreed , And they resolved together to proceed.
Yes , Reynold answered.
Well , replied the Wight ; I 'll wage , I 'm better lodged than you to-night.
MEANWHILE , however , while thus the lady sought.
His want of dress and miserable state Raised shame indeed , and showed distress was great.
Though LOVE be seen in Nature 's pure array , No dirt appears , however you survey.
THIS servant girl now hastened to the fair , And ev ` ry circumstance detailed with care.
Unasked , the stranger this attention got , And well perfumed ere clothes they would allot.
When dressed , he waited on the widow fair , And paid his compliments with graceful air.
On ev ` ry side assailed the youthful dame Herself surrendered unto Cupid 's flame.
One sin against another I may weigh , And man for man will equally repay.
THE silence first was broken by the dame ; Who spoke so freely , Reynold bolder came.
Now easy conversation was renewed ; Then mutual kisses ; ev ` ry sweet pursued.
His fortune to complete , that day they took The very wretches that he wished to hook.
If any one met her , she greeted him quite courteously.
`` Good day , dear countryman , it is a fine day.
She has claws beneath her gloves ; she is a witch"
One morning , a handsome young man was going through the forest.
`` But , good little mother ,"
said he , `` how canst thou carry all that away ?"
`` I must carry it , dear sir ,"
`` Will you help me ?"
she said , as he remained standing by her.
How soon you would bound up thither"
The young man took compassion on the old woman.
`` My father is certainly no peasant ,"
`` If you will try it ,"
said she , `` I shall be very glad.
`` See , it is quite light ,"
said she.
`` No , it is not light ,"
answered the count , and pulled a rueful face.
He had a mind to put everything down again , but the old woman would not allow it.
`` Just look ,"
Why are you standing loitering there ?"
she continued.
`` Step out.
No one will take the bundle off again"
`` Dame ,"
said he , `` I can go no farther.
I want to rest a little"
`` Not here ,"
Who knows what good it may do you ?"
`` Old woman , thou art becoming shameless !"
He turned and twisted , but he could not get rid of it.
The old woman laughed at this , and sprang about quite delighted on her crutch.
`` Do n't get angry , dear sir ,"
I will give you a good present when we get home"
She seemed to grow more and more nimble , and his burden still heavier.
`` Good mother ,"
`` By no means , my dear daughter ,"
You have fairly earned your wages , and they shall not be wanting"
The count knew not whether to laugh or to cry.
`` Such a sweetheart as that ,"
thought he , `` could not touch my heart , even if she were thirty years younger"
The youth lay down on the bench , under a wild apple-tree.
`` It is quite delightful here ,"
When he had slept a little while , the old woman came and shook him till he awoke.
`` Sit up ,"
Of money and land thou hast no need , here is something else for thee"
Thereupon she thrust a little book into his hand , which was cut out of a single emerald.
`` Take great care of it ,"
said she , `` it will bring thee good fortune"
She bade him rise and hand her the little book.
When she cried , not tears fell from her eyes , but pearls and jewels only.
You all love me , but the one of you who loves me best , shall fare the best"
Each of them said she loved him best.
`` Can you not express to me ,"
The eldest spoke.
`` I love my father as dearly as the sweetest sugar"
The second , `` I love my father as dearly as my prettiest dress"
But the youngest was silent.
`` I do not know , and can compare my love with nothing"
But her father insisted that she should name something.
You must tell me how you came by that pearl"
The King and the Queen resolved to seek out the old woman.
They thought that there where the pearl had been , they would obtain news of their daughter.
The old woman was sitting in that lonely place at her spinning-wheel , spinning.
Soon afterwards the daughter also entered.
But the old woman scarcely thanked her , and only shook her head a little.
Thus they both sat for two hours , and exchanged never a word.
At last something rustled at the window , and two fiery eyes peered in.
It was an old night-owl , which cried , `` Uhu !"
three times.
But the fair maiden was sad.
She sat down and wept bitterly.
She sprang up like a roe which has been overtaken by the shot of the hunter.
She ran back home , trembling like an aspen-leaf.
She led her into the room and lighted a new log.
she said to the girl.
`` But , mother ,"
`` Dost thou know then what time it is ?"
asked the old woman.
`` Not yet midnight ,"
answered the maiden , `` but already past eleven o'clock"
`` Dost thou not remember ,"
The old woman would not tell the maiden what lay before her.
`` My stay here is over ,"
`` But tell me what is about to happen ,"
the maiden continued to entreat.
`` I tell thee again , do not hinder me in my work.
Next day it seemed to him that he was on the right track.
When the moon illumined the surrounding country he perceived a figure coming down the mountain.
`` Oho ,"
They walked onwards full of joy , and soon came to the little house.
Their daughter , however , they did not see.
You , however , have been sufficiently punished by the misery in which you have lived"
Then she went to the chamber and called , `` Come out , my little daughter"
`` She needs nothing ,"
said the old woman.
When the old woman had said that , she disappeared from their sight.
That does not happen now-a-days , or else the poor would soon become rich"
Hill and vale do not come together , but the children of men do , good and bad.
In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other in their travels.
The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of enjoyment.
The shoemaker took a very hearty drink , and the storm on his face began to clear away.
Shall we travel together ?"
`` All right ,"
`` That is just where I want to go ,"
answered the shoemaker.
Both of them had time enough , but little to bite and to break.
but the tailor began to laugh and to sing , and shared all he got with his comrade.
`` What !"
Each , therefore , bought his own bread , and then they tried their luck in the forest.
It was as quiet there as in a church.
In the meantime he did not lose courage , but relied on God and on his luck.
In short he was pitiless.
`` Eat what one can , and suffer what one must"
When times were good with me , I shared what I had with thee.
My trade is of that kind that each stitch must always be exactly like the other.
If I no longer have my eyes and can sew no more I must go a-begging.
Thither the shoemaker guided the blind tailor , and then left him alone and went his way.
When day dawned he awoke , but knew not where he lay.
`` Yes , I am awake ,"
answered the second.
`` Then I will tell thee something ,"
The first thing he met was a brown foal running about the fields at large.
The foal , however , begged to be set free.
`` I am still too young ,"
A time may perhaps come when I may reward thee for it"
`` Run off ,"
said the tailor , `` I see thou art still a giddy thing"
But the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before.
`` The sun to be sure fills my eyes ,"
said he , `` but the bread does not fill my mouth.
The first thing that comes across me and is even half edible will have to suffer for it"
In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow towards him.
`` Halt , halt !"
cried the tailor , and seized him by the leg.
I must cut thy head off , and roast thee"
`` Do n't do that ,"
Leave me my life , and I may do thee good in some other way"
`` Well , be off , Cousin Longlegs ,"
said the tailor.
The stork rose up , let its long legs hang down , and flew gently away.
`` What 's to be the end of this ?"
Whatsoever comes in my way now is lost"
`` You come just at the right moment ,"
said he , and laid hold of one of them and was about to wring its neck.
`` Canst thou not imagine ,"
`` Only be quiet ,"
said the good-tempered tailor , `` thou shalt keep thy children ,"
and put the prisoner back into the water.
`` There I shall at once find the reward of my good deed ,"
said the tailor , `` the honey will refresh me"
The little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done.
`` Three dishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner !"
When he was satisfied he said , `` Now I will get to work"
He went round the town , sought a master , and soon found a good situation.
`` I can go no further in skill ,"
said he , `` and yet things improve every day"
At last the King appointed him court-tailor.
`` Before he takes revenge on me ,"
thought he to himself , `` I must dig a pit for him"
He , however , who digs a pit for another , falls into it himself.
`` That would please me very much ,"
`` Oho !"
thought the tailor , `` a rogue gives more than he has got.
replied the tailor , and told her his fate.
`` If that be all ,"
said the duck , `` we can help thee.
In the meantime just spread out thy handkerchief on the bank"
They swam to the shore and put the crown on the handkerchief.
The tailor thought , `` It gets worse and worse ! No one can endure that ?"
and threw his bundle on his back , and went forth.
When he came to the hollow tree , he sat down and hung his head.
answered the tailor , `` something quite different weighs me down ,"
and he told her what the King had demanded of him.
`` The time has come ,"
it said to the tailor , `` when I can repay thee for thy good deed.
But good fortune did not last long.
`` The reward is indeed great ,"
`` It ca n't be managed ,"
He tied up his bundle and hurried away to the gate.
The stork came to him and greeted him.
`` I see ,"
he began , `` that thou hast thy pack on thy back.
Why art thou leaving the town ?"
`` Do n't let thy hair grow gray about that ,"
said the stork , `` I will help thee out of thy difficulty.
Go home and be easy.
In nine days from this time repair to the royal palace , and there will I come"
The little tailor went home , and at the appointed time was at the castle.
It was not long before the stork came flying thither and tapped at the window.
`` It seems to me ,"
said he , `` just as if I had won the highest prize.
The road to the forest led him to the gallows.
`` If you want to know ,"
said the mother , `` seek it for yourself ,"
But the step-daughter said , `` Poor man , I will take you there , come with me"
Then said the maiden , `` I should like to be as beautiful and fair as the sun ,"
and instantly she was white and fair as day.
`` Then I should like to have a purse of money which would never grow empty"
That also was granted unto her , and then the Lord left her.
Then she answered , `` But , I pray thee , let no one see the picture"
`` Be quiet ,"
said the old woman , `` I will soon divert it to you ,"
The bride asked , `` What is my dear brother saying ?"
`` Ah ,"
The bride asked , `` What is my dear brother saying ?"
`` Ah ,"
And they drove on farther.
The bride asked , `` What is my dear brother saying ?"
`` Ah ,"
said the old woman , `` he says you must look out of the carriage"
They were , however , just on a bridge , which crossed deep water.
The kitchen-boy did it , and lighted a fire on the hearth.
The scullery-boy replied , `` He is imprisoned in the pit with adders and with snakes"
Then she asked , `` What is the black witch doing in the house ?"
The boy answered , `` She is loved by the King and happy"
`` May God have mercy on him ,"
said the duck , and swam forth by the sink.
The next night she came again and put the same questions , and the third night also.
All of which was done to her , and to her black daughter.
he replied.
Then the other said , `` Come with me , and be a thief"
`` No ,"
`` Oh ,"
`` I do n't know yet ,"
he replied.
The youngest brother also met a man who spoke to him , and inquired what his intentions were.
`` Would you not like to be a tailor ?"
said he.
`` Not that I know of ,"
`` Oh , but you are speaking in ignorance ,"
`` So now ,"
said he , quite delighted , `` the wind has blown you back again to me"
The astronomer took his glass , looked up , and said , `` There are five"
He certainly must have had some of the powder for shooting round corners.
`` Now it 's your turn ,"
The tailor brought his needle , and sewed them as his father wished.
`` Well ,"
I ca n't say which of you deserves the most praise.
That will be proved if you have but an early opportunity of using your talents"
and resolved to go forth together and liberate the King 's daughter.
`` I will soon know where she is ,"
There the King 's daughter was sitting , and the dragon was lying asleep on her lap.
`` Then I will try my art ,"
When the King once more saw his daughter , there were great rejoicings.
Then a warm contest arose among them , for each of them preferred his own claim.
We 'll properly equip you as a belle , And I will certainly reward you well.
A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow 's nest.
Little birds have to encounter great dangers !"
`` Ah , my son ,"
said the son.
`` Where hast thou seen that ?"
`` In a merchant 's garden ,"
said the youngster.
`` Oh , my son , merchant folks are quick folks ,"
said the father.
After this he asked the next , `` Where hast thou passed thy time ?"
`` At court ,"
said the son.
`` Yes , father ,"
`` Where hast thou seen that ?"
said the old bird.
`` At court , among the stable-boys"
The father examined the third also : `` Where didst thou seek thy safety ?"
`` That is indeed dainty fare ,"
`` That is true ,"
`` Where hast thou seen that ?"
`` Mountain folks are working folks , and clever folks.
`` Where hast thou learned this ?"
`` There ,"
he thought , `` I can surely be town-musician"
`` What are you gasping so for , you big fellow ?"
asked the donkey.
`` Ah ,"
`` I tell you what ,"
I will play the lute , and you shall beat the kettledrum"
The hound agreed , and on they went.
asked the donkey.
`` Who can be merry when his neck is in danger ?"
answered the cat.
But now good advice is scarce.
Where am I to go ?"
`` Go with us to Bremen.
You understand night-music , you can be a town-musician"
The cat thought well of it , and went with them.
`` Your crow goes through and through one ,"
said the donkey.
`` What is the matter ?"
Now I am crowing at full pitch while I can"
`` Ah , but red-comb ,"
said the donkey , `` you had better come away with us.
The cock agreed to this plan , and all four went on together.
The donkey , as the biggest , went to the window and looked in.
`` What do you see , my grey-horse ?"
asked the cock.
`` What do I see ?"
`` That would be the sort of thing for us ,"
said the cock.
`` Yes , yes ; ah , how I wish we were there !"
said the donkey.
and ordered one of them to go and examine the house.
And the mouth of him who last told this story is still warm"
The lady fancied what the swain had said , Was policy , and to concealment led.
But most howe'er she grudged the surplus joy , Bestowed on such a vile , deceitful boy.
To blame him useless ` twere you must allow ; The French such frolicks readily avow"

When the sun arose , and Hans woke up , he was lying in a deep cavern.
He looked around on every side and exclaimed , `` Oh , heavens , where am I ?"
`` Alas , thou canst not help me"
`` I well know your desire ,"
said the cat.
`` You wish to have a beautiful horse.
`` Well , this is a wonderful cat !"
thought Hans , `` but I am determined to see if she is telling the truth"
They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs , and were merry and happy.
In the evening when they sat down to dinner , three of them had to make music.
`` No ,"
said he , `` I wo n't dance with a pussy cat.
I have never done that yet"
`` Then take him to bed ,"
said she to the cats.
`` That feels very soft !"
said Hans.
Once she said to him , `` Go and mow my meadow , and dry the grass ,"
`` No ,"
said the cat , `` you must first do something more for me of the same kind.
Nevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six months.
The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses ? `` Yes ,"
said Hans.
So Hans set out , and she showed him the way to the mill.
They asked Hans where his horse was.
`` It will follow me in three days ' time"
Then they laughed and said , `` Indeed , stupid Hans , where wilt thou get a horse ?"
`` It will be a fine one !"
Then the King 's daughter said that they were to bring him immediately.
`` And that is for the third miller 's boy ,"
said she.
`` Then he must have the mill ,"
First Story.
Then the snake came in haste , and enjoyed its food.
The snake , however , only drank the milk , and left the bread-crumbs alone.
From that time forth , a change came over the child.
Second Story.
The girl took up the crown , it glittered and was of delicate golden filagree work.
Third Story.
A snake cries , `` Huhu , huhu"
A child says , `` Come out"
The snake says , `` No"
`` Neither have I"
`` Then I am like you.
Huhu , huhu , huhu"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the doctor , `` that is soon managed"
`` What must I do ?"
asked the peasant.
and have that nailed up above thy house-door"
The peasant did everything that he had been told to do.
Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money.
`` Oh , yes , but Grethe , my wife , must go too"
`` Yes , but my wife , Grethe , too ,"
said he , and he seated himself with her at the table.
meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish.
The second did not want to go in at all , but was forced.
This servant was just as much alarmed , and he got out.
They led him to the spot where the money was concealed.
The fifth servant , however , crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more.
Then Dr.
He asked them , `` Where does the godfather live ?"
The broom replied , `` One flight of stairs higher up"
When he came to the second flight , he saw a heap of dead fingers lying.
He asked , `` Where does the godfather live ?"
One of the fingers replied , `` One flight of stairs higher"
They , too , said , `` One flight of stairs higher"
`` How stupid you are !"
said the godfather.
`` That was the boy and the maid talking to each other"
`` But on the second flight I saw dead fingers lying"
`` Oh , how silly you are ! Those were some roots of scorzonera"
`` On the third flight lay a heap of dead men 's heads"
`` Foolish man , those were cabbages"
`` On the fourth flight , I saw fishes in a pan , which were hissing and baking themselves"
When he had said that , the fishes came and served themselves up.
`` Oh , that is a lie !"
Then he took his fiddle from his back , and played so that it echoed through the trees.
It was not long before a wolf came trotting through the thicket towards him.
`` Ah , here is a wolf coming ! I have no desire for him !"
I should like to learn that , too"
`` It is soon learned ,"
the musician replied , `` thou hast only to do all that I bid thee"
`` Oh , musician ,"
said the wolf , `` I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master"
`` Look ,"
said the musician , `` if thou wilt learn to fiddle , put thy fore paws into this crevice"
`` Stay there until I come back again ,"
said the musician , and went his way.
and took his fiddle and again played in the forest.
It was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him.
`` Ah , there 's a fox coming !"
said the musician.
`` I have no desire for him"
`` That is soon learned ,"
said the musician.
`` Thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee"
`` Oh , musician ,"
then said the fox , `` I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master"
`` Follow me ,"
The fox obeyed , and the musician fastened his paw to the left bough.
`` Little fox ,"
said he , `` now reach me thy right paw"
and he tied it to the right bough.
`` Wait there till I come back again ,"
said the musician , and went his way.
so he took his fiddle , and the sound echoed through the forest.
Then a little hare came springing towards him.
`` Why , a hare is coming ,"
said the musician , `` I do not want him"
`` Ah , dear musician ,"
said the hare , `` how beautifully thou dost fiddle ; I too , should like to learn that"
`` That is soon learned ,"
said the musician , `` thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee"
`` Oh , musician ,"
replied the little hare , `` I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master"
`` Now briskly , little hare , run twenty times round the tree !"
`` Wait there till I come back ,"
said the musician , and went onwards.
Full of anger and rage he hurried after the musician and wanted to tear him to pieces.
`` At last comes the right companion ,"
said the musician , `` for I was seeking a human being , and no wild beast"
Then the beasts were terrified and ran back into the forest.
The musician , however , played once more to the man out of gratitude , and then went onwards"
`` If that be true ,"
said the man , `` then I can well do you a favor"
`` Yes ,"
Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into the water , and went home.
But where his hovel had formerly stood , now stood a great castle.
`` Yes ,"
`` There is no need of your knowing ,"
said the man , `` for I see yonder a great cupboard , just unlock it"
Then the woman cried joyfully , `` What more can you want , my dear ?"
and they sat down , and ate and drank together.
`` Alas ,"
`` Very good ,"
But fortune would so have it , that he once more drew out the golden fish.
`` Listen ,"
`` I will take good care ,"
answered the fisherman , and threw the fish back into the water.
In an instant the castle disappeared , and they were back again in their old hut.
`` Now you have got what you want ,"
said he ; `` and we can gnaw at a bare bone again"
`` Ah ,"
`` Listen ,"
The fisherman took the fish home with him , and did as it had bidden him.
It came to pass , however , that from the two pieces that were"
The neighbors quickly gathered , and the servants came running upstairs to see what was the matter.
On hearing this the merchant went to the king , and told him what had taken place.
`` Oh yes ,"
replied the woman , `` I should know them again among all the people in the city"
`` Then ,"
A royal proclamation was issued to this effect.
They came to see the tamasha.
`` My own son and the son of my chief vizier !"
exclaimed the king , who had been present from the commencement.
`` What examples for the people ! Let them both be executed"
`` Not so , your Majesty ,"
said the vizier , `` I beseech you Let the facts of the case be thoroughly investigated.
How is it ?"
he continued , turning to the two young men.
`` Why have you done this cruel thing ?"
answered the prince.
`` I suppose the arrow struck the merchant 's wife.
Had I known that she or anybody had been near I should not have shot in that direction"
`` We will speak of this later on ,"
said the king , on hearing this answer.
`` Dismiss the people.
Their presence is no longer needed"
In the evening his Majesty and the vizier had a long and earnest talk about their two sons.
This was finally agreed to.
When they reached the last custom - house the vizier 's son overtook them.
He had come with all haste , bringing with him four bags of muhrs on four horses.
`` I am come ,"
We have lived together , we will be exiled together , and we will die together.
Turn me not back , if you love me"
`` Consider ,"
the prince answered , `` what you are doing.
All kinds of trial may be before me.
Why should you leave your home and country to be with me ?"
`` Because I love you ,"
he said , `` and shall never be happy without you"
After waiting half an hour the prince became impatient , and rose up and walked about.
Again he saw the reflection in the water which was in his palm.
There he came across the footmarks of his friend.
`` Alas ! alas !"
he cried , and lifting up the prince , he poured some water over his head and face.
Speak , speak ! I can not bear this !"
`` Thank God !"
exclaimed the vizier 's son.
`` But what is the matter , brother ?"
`` Go away ,"
replied the prince.
`` I do n't want to say anything to you , or to see you.
Go away"
`` Come , come ; let us leave this place.
Look , I have brought some food for you , and horses , and everything.
Let us eat and depart"
`` Go alone ,"
replied the prince.
`` Never ,"
said the vizier 's son.
`` I have looked upon a fairy ,"
the prince said.
Then I fainted.
Oh ! if you can get me that fairy for my wife , I will go anywhere with you"
`` Oh , brother ,"
said the vizier 's son , `` you have indeed seen a fairy.
She is a fairy of the fairies.
This is none other than person_0 of the Ivory City.
I know this from the signs that she gave you.
Be patient , and rest assured that I will arrange your marriage with her"
On the way they met two men.
These two men belonged to a family of robbers.
There were eleven of them altogether.
`` It is late ,"
they said , `` and there is not another village within several miles"
`` Shall we accept this good man 's invitation , brother ?"
asked the prince.
It is very kind of you to ask us"
So they all four went to the robbers ' tower.
`` It is no good groaning ,"
said the vizier 's son.
`` I will climb to the window , and see whether there are any means of escape.
Yes ! yes !"
he whispered , when he had reached the window-hole.
`` Below there is a ditch surrounded by a high wall.
I will jump down and reconnoitre.
You stay here , and wait till I return"
She had agreed to release them on the promise of her marriage with the prince.
So the woman led the way out of the enclosure by a secret door.
`` But where are the horses and the goods ?"
the vizier 's son inquired.
`` You can not bring them ,"
the woman said.
`` To go out by any other way would be to thrust oneself into the grave"
`` All right , then ; they also shall go out by this door.
I have a charm , whereby I can make them thin or fat"
And one of the arrows killed the woman , so they had to leave her behind.
On , on they rode , until they reached a village where they stayed the night.
The following morning they were off again , and asked for Ivory City from every passer-by.
She agreed to let them stay there for a few days.
As soon as her work was over the old woman came and sat down with her lodgers.
The vizier 's son pretended to be utterly ignorant of the place and people.
`` Has this city a name ?"
he asked the old woman.
`` Of course it has , you stupid.
Every little village , much more a city , and such a city as this , has a name"
`` What is the name of this city ?"
`` Ivory City.
Do n't you know that ? I thought the name was known all over the world"
On the mention of the name Ivory City the prince gave a deep sigh.
`` Is there a king of this country ?"
continued the vizier 's son.
`` Of course there is , and a queen , and a princess"
`` What are their names ?"
`` The name of the princess is person_0 , and the name of the queen --"
`` Yes ,"
he said to him afterwards , `` we are in the right country.
We shall see the beautiful princess"
`` Who is coming ?"
said the vizier 's son.
`` Nobody ,"
the old woman replied.
`` Then where are you going ?"
`` I am going to see my daughter , who is a servant of the Princess person_0.
I see her and the princess every day.
I should have gone yesterday , if you had not been here and taken up all my time"
`` Ah-h-h ! Be careful not to say anything about us in the hearing of the princess"
On seeing her mother the girl pretended to be very angry.
`` Why have you not been for two days ?"
she asked.
`` Because , my dear ,"
It is nothing but cooking and cleaning , and cleaning and cooking , all day long.
I ca n't understand the men ,"
she added ; `` one of them especially appears very stupid.
He asked me the name of this country and the name of the king.
They each give me a muhr every morning and every evening"
`` Alas ! alas !"
said the prince , who had eagerly listened to every word.
`` What , then , will be her anger at the sight of a man ?"
`` Anger ?"
said the vizier 's son , with an astonished air.
`` She would be exceedingly glad to see one man.
I know this.
`` Heaven be praised !"
the prince exclaimed.
`` Get the swing ,"
she said to one of the servants standing by.
`` Oh !"
she cried , `` I thought that both of you would be killed by this time.
The royal elephants have got loose and are running about wildly.
When I heard this I was anxious about you.
So the princess gave me this charmed swing to return in.
But come , let us get outside before the elephants arrive and batter down the place"
`` Do n't believe this ,"
said the vizier 's son.
`` It is a mere hoax.
They have been playing tricks with you"
`` You will soon have your heart 's desire ,"
he whispered aside to the prince.
`` These things are signs"
Oh , what a happy meeting it was ! `` At last ,"
said person_0 , `` I have seen my beloved , my husband"
`` A thousand thanks to Heaven for bringing me to you ,"
said the prince.
Henceforth the prince visited person_0 every day and returned to the hut every night.
One morning person_0 begged him to stay with her always.
She could not live without seeing him.
A few days after this conversation she ordered one of her maids to make a pilaw.
Accordingly he sent back his salam and expressions of thankfulness.
Taking off the lid , he threw it aside on the grass and then washed his hands.
The moment the crows ate what was thrown to them they fell down dead.
`` Heaven be praised ,"
exclaimed the vizier 's son , `` who has preserved me from death at this time !"
On the return of the prince that evening the vizier 's son was very reticent and depressed.
The prince noticed this change in him , and asked what was the reason.
`` Is it because I am away so much at the palace ?"
`` Look here ,"
It is saturated with poison.
Thank Heaven , I discovered it in time !"
`` The Princess person_0.
Listen.
It will provoke tears , and person_0 will ask you why you are crying.
Tell her that you weep for the loss of your friend , who died suddenly this morning.
It is strong , and will immediately send her into a deep sleep.
Then , while she is asleep , heat the shovel and mark her back with it.
Remember to bring back the shovel again , and also to take her pearl necklace.
This done , return.
`` It is well ,"
said the vizier 's son , when he heard of this proclamation.
The prince took it to a goldsmith and asked him to buy it.
`` How much do you want for it ?"
asked the man.
`` Fifty thousand rupees ,"
the prince replied.
`` All right ,"
said the man ; `` wait here while I go and fetch the money"
`` How did you get the necklace ?"
the kotwal asked.
`` A fakir , whose servant I am , gave it to me to sell in the bazaar ,"
the prince replied.
`` Permit me , and I will show you where he is"
`` Call the king hither ,"
he replied , `` and then I will tell his Majesty face to face"
On this some men went to the king and told him what the fakir had said.
`` Last night ,"
While running away from me her necklace got loose and dropped.
You wonder at these words , but they are not difficult to prove.
Examine your daughter , and you will find the marks of the burn on her back.
`` It is so ,"
said the maid-servant ; `` the burn is there"
`` Then let the girl be slain immediately ,"
the king shouted.
`` No , no , your Majesty ,"
they replied.
The king agreed , and so the princess was taken to the graveyard.
said the fakir.
The princess wept , and acknowledged that he was her greatest helper and friend.
When the vizier read the letter he went and informed the king.
Accordingly they did this ; the prince wrote the letter at the vizier 's son 's dictation.
He ordered the execution of some of the viziers on a certain date.
`` Come ,"
he wrote back to the vizier 's son , `` and stay at the palace.
And if the prince desires it , I will arrange for his marriage with person_0 as soon as possible"
He agreed to do so , and succeeded in obtaining their pardon.
Henceforth all was sunshine on the path of the prince.
The region round the little town of Kjoege is very bleak and bare.
He might go into the water now , he said , for person_1 had dreamed it.
`` On the shop-board ,"
`` His thoughts were far more extravagant , as is always the case with a man.
`` And that is the story , and here they are , both of them ,"
said the baker in conclusion.
And there they are for you !"
`` She has a very sweet voice , that little girl ,"
they said.
Those were glorious days , but they could not last for ever.
The neighbors were neighbors no longer.
Ah , how often his thoughts were with person_1 ! Did she think of him ? Yes.
He ran the awl far into his finger , but he did not care for that.
How glad person_1 would be ! She was now seventeen years old , and he nineteen.
Next Sunday he was to pay a visit to person_1 's father.
Everything in the room had a prosperous look , and person_1 's father received him very kindly.
`` person_1 will be glad to see you ,"
said the father : `` you have grown quite a nice young man.
You shall see her presently.
She has her own room now , and pays us rent for it"
person_0 saw all this at a glance : and yet he saw nothing but person_1.
In all Kjoege there was not a girl like her.
She did not really do so , but she came very near it.
No , she had not grown proud at all.
Yes , certainly she was fond of person_0.
and therefore he could very well go again the next Sunday , and resolved to do so.
`` He is only a young fellow ,"
he said.
Nothing comes of silent love : I have learned that from the cakes"
And all the people shouted and applauded , and person_0 cried out `` hurrah !"
Even the king smiled at person_1 , and seemed to delight in her.
So soon as Sunday came , he went again.
He felt as if he were going into a church.
person_1 was alone , and received him -- it could not have happened more fortunately.
`` It is well that you are come ,"
she said.
It seemed to person_0 as if the whole room were whirling round and round with him.
`` You honest , faithful soul !"
she exclaimed ; and these words of hers loosened person_0 's tongue.
And she drew her white hand over his hot forehead.
`` Heaven gives us strength for much ,"
she said , `` if we only endeavor to do our best"
Come , be a man ,"
`` You are a child ,"
And then they parted.
-- and certainly there was good consolation in that -- and thus they parted.
She sailed to France , and person_0 wandered about the muddy streets of Copenhagen.
And they went with him to the dancing-rooms.
`` Heaven gives us strength for a great deal , if we only try to do our best ,"
she had said ; and holy thoughts came into his mind , and he folded his hands.
The world went on its course , but person_0 pursued his lonely way , unheedingly.
The winter came , and the streams were frozen.
Everything seemed to be preparing for a burial.
The streets seem to stretch themselves along just as they please.
The houses do not like standing in regular ranks.
Here in the market-place stood person_0 , with his knapsack on his back.
The sunlight streamed in through the stained glass windows , between the two lofty slender pillars.
His spirit became prayerful , and peace returned to his soul.
Yes , he had certainly gone from the `` Elder-mother"
to the `` Willow-father"
Nevertheless , he could not remain.
And thus it stood with him.
sighed he , `` that the Last Day were come !"
Silently he wandered through the land , that seemed to him as an orchard covered with soft turf.
They were an old pious couple , in whose workshop he now labored.
To himself also it seemed as if Heaven had lifted the heavy burden from his heart.
Poor person_0 seized his master 's hand , and called out aloud , `` person_1 !"
`` Yes , yes , her name is person_1 ,"
In the street the people crowded round her carriage , and drew it away in triumph.
Then person_0 went home and packed his knapsack.
The old couple begged him to remain , but no words could induce him to stay.
So he went away towards the mountains , and marched up them and down them.
The stars gleamed above him , his feet stumbled , and his head grew dizzy.
He felt he was ill.
.
It was thawing ; there was rain in the valley.
It was evening.
He was walking on the public high-road.
By the road-side grew a great willow tree.
to him.
`` We thank you ,"
they said to person_0.
`` Our master first ,"
`` That was the most delicious hour of my life !"
he said , `` and it was but a dream.
Oh , let me dream again !"
And he closed his eyes once more , and slept and dreamed.
Towards morning there was a great fall of snow.
The wind drifted the snow over him , but he slept on.
The villagers came forth to go to church , and by the road-side sat a journeyman.
He was dead -- frozen to death under the willow tree !"
Some years have elapsed since the time of which we speak.
-- that is to say , it eats as much as it earns.
Jeppe-Jaens cultivated his field in summer.
They carved shoes and spoons , and that brought in money.
It would have been wronging the Jeppe-Jaenses to call them poor people.
person_0 's father and his assistant propelled the boat with staves.
The water-lilies rocked themselves on the river.
`` Take me with you !"
she cried.
`` Follow me !"
he cried.
`` Yonder lies the house"
But the house was not yonder.
Soon they heard a loud piercing scream.
They stood still and listened , and presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood.
Now again they heard the cry they had heard before.
`` We shall get into trouble about the pig ,"
said person_0.
`` Come , let us go to our house ,"
said person_1 ; `` it is here in the wood"

aaaaa -RRB- aaa And they went forward.
At last they both lost themselves in a thicket.
The sun was high in the heavens when the two children awoke.
They could see fish in great numbers in the pure water illumined by the sun 's rays.
But there was another surprise and another fright in store for them.
She was a gipsy.
The children did not at once understand what she said.
And person_1 and person_0 looked at the wishing-nuts with great eyes.
`` Is there a carriage with a pair of horses in this nut ?"
he asked.
`` Yes , there 's a golden carriage with two horses ,"
answered the woman.
`` Then give me the nut ,"
said little person_0.
inquired person_1.
`` There are ten neckerchiefs in it ,"
answered the woman.
`` There are beautiful dresses in it , and stockings , and a hat with a veil"
`` Then I will have that one too ,"
cried little person_0.
And person_1 gave her the second nut also.
The third was a little black thing.
`` That one you can keep ,"
said person_0 ; `` and it is a pretty one too"
`` What is in it ?"
inquired person_1.
`` The best of all things for you ,"
replied the gipsy-woman.
And person_1 held the nut very tight.
But that is no reason why we should suspect the gipsy-woman of wanting to steal the children.
They were pardoned and forgiven , although they had indeed both deserved `` to get into trouble ;"
was said to be enclosed.
`` Yes , that 's exactly what I thought ,"
said person_1.
And winter came on , and the new year began ; indeed , several years went by.
`` Only think ,"
And person_1 and person_0 took leave of one another.
People called them `` the betrothed ;"
And thereupon they parted.
person_1 was confirmed.
Only seldom he got news of person_0 from some passing postillion or eel-fisher.
This was certainly good news.
There she stood , in grand array , and person_1 was in his working clothes.
`` Did you know me again directly , person_1 ?"
How often I have thought of you , person_0 , and of the old times !"
Her father and person_1 escorted her as far as the village.
His eyes brightened , but still the words came halting over his lips.
`` Yes , let us wait for a time , person_1 ,"
she replied ; and he kissed her lips.
`` I confide in you , person_1 ,"
said person_0 ; `` and I think that I love you -- but I will sleep upon it"
And with that they parted.
The signature was prefaced by the words , `` Faithful till death !"
One day the boatman came into person_1 , and brought him a greeting from person_0.
said the boatman.
Then he said slowly : `` person_0 must not refuse this advantageous offer"
`` Then do you write a few words to her ,"
said the boatman.
Do not think of me , or my position , but think of your own welfare.
May all treasures of happiness be poured out upon you , person_0.
Heaven will console me in its own good time.
`` Ever your sincere friend , `` ib"
And the letter was dispatched , and person_0 duly received it.
Her part had thus come true.
And to him , person_1 , the nut had offered only black earth.
The gipsy-woman had said , this was `` the best of all for him"
Yes , it was right , that also was coming true.
The black earth was the best for him.
Now he understood clearly what had been the woman 's meaning.
In the black earth , in the dark grave , would be the best happiness for him.
Yes , now person_0 could have the golden carriage , and plenty of fine clothes.
And again the weather bloomed and faded.
.
It was a great golden armlet of ancient workmanship that he had found.
He had disturbed a `` Hun 's Grave ,"
and discovered the costly treasure buried in it.
`` You have found in the earth the best thing you could find ,"
said the judge.
`` The best thing !"
thought person_1.
So person_1 traveled with the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen.
And he arrived in Copenhagen.
And person_1 of the heath wandered about in the great capital.
He had wandered into the suburb of Christianhaven , into a poor little street.
Not a human being was to be seen.
At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched houses.
He asked her what ailed her , but could not understand what she said in reply.
person_1 struck a light with the help of a match.
It was the mother of the child who lay sighing on the miserable bed.
`` Can I be of any service to you ?"
asked person_1.
Are there no neighbors or friends whom I could call to you ?"
And he raised the sick woman 's head , and smoothed her pillow.
The wealth which her husband had inherited from his parents had made him proud and arrogant.
The icy hand of death was already on person_0.
`` I am unhappy at the thought of dying and leaving the poor child here alone ,"
she said.
`` Ah , what is to become of the poor thing ?"
And not a word more could she utter.
And it was in the forest by the river Gudenau , in the region of the heath.
-LRB- Illustration : LITTLE CHRISTINE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa person_1 had money , and was said to have provided for the future.
This person_1 was the second son of the Emperor Keiko , and he was named person_0.
She then wished him all success in his undertaking and bade him good speed.
`` I will now set out ,"
said the person_1 , and returning to the Palace he put himself at the head of his troops.
He now met with great difficulties , for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough.
It was all but impossible to go on.
We can not clear the roads and fight as well.
It is wiser for me to resort to stratagem and come upon my enemies unawares.
In that way I may be able to kill them without much exertion"
So he now bade his army halt by the way.
When he had finished his unusual toilet , Ototachibana brought him her mirror.
He smiled as he gazed at himself -- the disguise was so perfect.
He hardly knew himself , so changed was he.
Thus completely disguised , he set out for the enemy 's camp alone.
Like an apparition of loveliness she appeared in the soft twilight.
`` What a beautiful woman ! Where has she come from ?"
said the astonished Kumaso , forgetting war and council and everything as he looked at the gentle intruder.
He beckoned to the disguised person_1 and bade him sit down and serve them with wine.
This was the moment for which the brave person_1 had been waiting.
`` Wait one moment !"
gasped the brigand painfully , and he seized the person_1 's hand.
person_0 relaxed his hold somewhat and said.
`` Why should I pause , thou villain ?"
and he held the dagger dripping red above the rebel 's head.
`` Ah ,"
gasped the dying man with a great effort , `` I have often heard of you.
You are indeed a strong man to have so easily overcome us.
Allow me to give you a new name.
From henceforth you shall be known as person_0 Take.
Our title I bequeath to you as the bravest man in person_0"
And with these noble words , Takeru fell back and died.
On the way back he passed through the province of Idum.
He again resorted to stratagem , and feigned friendship with the rebel under an assumed name.
Knowing nothing of this , the brigand came up to the bank shortly.
He seized quickly what he thought was his sword and stood on guard to defend himself.
But the person_1 was not allowed to live an idle life long.
These she presented to him as a parting gift.
Here the governor welcomed the person_1 right heartily and entertained him royally with many feasts.
He looked round for a chance of escape.
There was none.
He was surrounded by fire.
`` This deer hunt was then only a cunning trick of the enemy !"
`` What a fool I was to be lured into this trap like a wild beast !"
and he ground his teeth with rage as he thought of the governor 's smiling treachery.
Dangerous as was his situation now , the person_1 was not in the least confounded.
He was full of resource and courage , and finally outwitted and subdued all his foes.
In these dangers and adventures he had been followed by his faithful loving wife the person_1ss Ototachibana.
For Kin Jin.
I will now cast myself into your outraged depths , giving my life for his.
Therefore hear me and bring him safely to the shore of Kadzusa"
When the person_1 reached Omi he found the people in a state of great excitement and fear.
In many houses as he passed along he saw the signs of mourning and heard loud lamentations.
It.
Not long shall it find pleasure in devouring innocent folk.
I will start out and kill it at once"
With these words he set out for the Ibuki Mountain , where the monster was said to live.
`` This must be the monster ,"
said the person_1 ; `` I do not need my sword for a serpent.
I can kill him with my hands"
He thereupon sprang upon the serpent and tried to strangle it to death with his bare arms.
Here ends the story of person_1 Take of Japan"
Long , long ago , there lived an old bamboo wood-cutter.
Looking round in astonishment , he saw that the brilliance was streaming from one bamboo.
The old man.
full of wonder.
dropped his ax and went towards the light.
Her presence seemed to have a benign influence on those there.
For three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music.
They stood there in all weathers , in sunshine and in rain.
Sometimes they wrote letters to the person_2 , but no answer was vouchsafed to them.
Still Princes person_1 gave no sign of having received their verses.
In this hopeless state the winter passed.
The snow and frost and the cold winds gradually gave place to the gentle warmth of spring.
Thus several days passed , but even so they could not rest in their homes.
So again they set out for the bamboo-cutter 's house.
Will you refuse to do as I wish ?"
The old man listened with great joy as she spoke these dutiful words.
It is necessary and right that you should see these five suitors and choose one of them"
`` Oh , why ,"
said the person_2 in distress , `` must I do this ? I have no wish to marry now"
`` I found you ,"
The light streamed from the bamboo in which you were hid and led me to you.
So I have always thought that you were more than mortal woman.
`` All you say is very reasonable ,"
What more can you demand ?"
This was to test them.
person_2 wondered that the person_0 should have returned so soon.
She returned it at once and refused to see him.
The person_0 threw the bowl away and returned to his home in despair.
He gave up now all hopes of ever winning the person_2.
He only allowed his servants to accompany him half-way , and then sent them back.
So he tried to persuade the person_2 to consent to see the man.
But she remained silent and looked very sad.
person_2 took the branch in her hand and looked at it carefully.
Then the man did not scruple to make up a long story.
`` Two years ago I took a ship and started in search of Mount Horai.
After going before the wind for some time I reached the far Eastern Sea.
Our food gave out , and we suffered much from sickness on board.
` Yes , this is Mount Horai ! '"
She called in the workmen and had them paid liberally , and they went away happy.
But on the way home they were overtaken by the disappointed man.
The virtue of any part of this animal was that no fire could harm it.
He handed his friend a large sum of money , and received the fire-rat 's skin.
If it were the real thing it would not burn.
So the Third person_0 failed also.
Now the Fourth person_0 was no more enterprising than the rest.
The person_0 became desperate.
They were at last blown on shore , for navigation was primitive in those days.
Worn out with his travels and anxiety , the fourth suitor gave himself up to rest.
The Imperial messenger insisted , saying it was the Emperor 's order.
The next day the Emperor set out with his retinue , which he soon managed to outride.
He found the bamboo-cutter 's house and dismounted.
Her only answer was to hide her face in her sleeves.
But the person_2 stopped him.
Her figure faded from his sight while he looked.
So be bade her good-by , and left the house with a sad heart.
These little songs always gave him pleasure.
The old bamboo-cutter went out to meet the Imperial messengers.
The men returned and told His Majesty all that had passed.
All were well trained archers , with bows and arrows.
The bamboo-cutter and his wife hid person_2 in an inner room.
Even the Emperors men would be powerless.
`` The time has come ,"
he said , `` for person_2 to return to the moon from whence she came.
We put the gold in the bamboos for you to find"
said the old man.
`` I pray you to look elsewhere"
Then the messenger called aloud , saying : `` person_2 , come out from this lowly dwelling.
Rest not here another moment ,"
The messenger led her forth and placed her in the chariot.
She looked back , and saw with pity the deep sorrow of the old man.
The bamboo-cutter implored to be allowed to accompany her , but this was not allowed.
The person_2 took off her embroidered outer garment and gave it to him as a keepsake.
I must not forget my good friend the Emperor.
I must write him once more to say good-by while still in this human form"
In spite of the impatience of the messengers and charioteers she kept them waiting while she wrote.
person_2 's letter was carried to the Palace.
Mount Fuji , and there the Royal emissaries burnt it on the summit at sunrise.
Because of his matchless skill as a hunter , he was called `` Yama-sachi-hiko"
or `` The person_0 of the Mountains"
or the `` Skillful Fisher of the Sea"
He baited his hook and then threw it into the sea clumsily.
`` What is the matter ? -- what have you done ?"
asked the elder brother impatiently.
`` I have lost your precious fishing hook --"
The mistake of our trying unfamiliar tasks is soon seen ! And you have done badly.
I will not return you your bow and arrow till you have found my hook.
Look to it that you find it and return it to me quickly"
He hunted everywhere for the hook most diligently , but it was nowhere to be found.
He was at last obliged to give up all hope of finding it.
It was useless ; his brother would not listen to him , much less grant his request.
`` Though you make a million hooks ,"
said the Skillful Fisher , shaking his head , `` they are of no use to me.
I can not forgive you unless you bring me back my own hook"
`` You are Hohodemi , the Augustness , sometimes called the person_0 , are you not ?"
asked the old man.
`` What are you doing alone in such a place ?"
`` Yes , I am he ,"
answered the unhappy young man.
`` Unfortunately , while fishing I lost my brother 's precious fishing hook.
But who are you ?"
`` My name is Shiwozuchino Okina , and I live near by on this shore.
I am sorry to hear what misfortune has befallen you.
You must indeed be anxious.
`` Then what can I do ?"
asked the distressed man.
I think that would be the best way"
`` Your idea is a splendid one ,"
`` Oh , there will be no difficulty about your getting there ,"
said the old man ; `` I can soon make something for you to ride on through the sea"
`` Thank you ,"
said the person_0 , `` I shall be very grateful to you if you will be so kind"
Large katsura trees overshadowed it.
Surely some one would come out to draw water from the well some time , he thought.
Ere long he saw the huge gate swing open , and two beautiful women came out.
He saw that in their hands they carried golden buckets.
So I climbed into the tree , much vexed , and waited for some one to come.
`` No ordinary mortal would give away a jewel so freely.
Will you not honor us by telling us who you are ?"
said the elder damsel.
`` Certainly ,"
`` Are you indeed Hohodemi , the grandson of Amaterasu , the Sun Goddess ?"
asked the damsel who had spoken first.
`` And ,"
said the person_0.
This kind old man also showed me how to come.
Now you know how it is I am here and why.
I want to ask Ryn Jin , if he knows where the lost hook is.
asked the person_0 anxiously.
should come down to the bottom of the sea"
`` Yes , indeed ,"
answered the Princess Tamayori , in her sweet voice.
`` As you say , we can know no greater honor than to welcome the Mikoto to our home"
`` Then I ask you to be so kind as to lead the way ,"
said the person_0.
`` Condescend to enter , Mikoto -LRB- Augustness -RRB- ,"
said both the sisters , and bowing low , they led him through the gate.
He then ordered them all to the entrance of the Palace to welcome the person_0.
Ryn Jin then dressed himself in his robes of ceremony , and went out to welcome him.
Condescend to remember us forever !"
answered the person_0 , saluting his host most ceremoniously.
`` I must apologize for all the trouble I am giving you by my unexpected visit"
And he bowed again , and thanked the Sea person_2.
`` You need not thank me ,"
said Ryn Jin.
`` It is I who must thank you for coming.
A great feast was now spread before the person_2 and his Royal guest.
`` Certainly ,"
said the obliging Sea person_2 , `` I will immediately summon them all here and ask them"
They sat looking at each other and at the Dragon person_2.
`` Where is your proof ?"
asked the person_2.
You had better send for him at once !"
Will you send for him and inquire into the matter.
Then our innocence will be proved"
`` Yes ,"
Send for him at once !"
He led him before the person_2.
The TAI sat there looking frightened and ill.
.
`` Answer , O TAI !"
cried the Sea person_2 , `` why did you not come in answer to my summons today ?"
`` I have been ill since yesterday ,"
answered the TAI ; `` that is why I could not come"
`` Do n't say another word !"
cried out Ryn Jin angrily.
`` Your illness is the punishment of the gods for stealing the Mikoto 's hook"
`` It is only too true !"
I had no intention of stealing the Mikoto 's hook.
So I hope you will pardon me"
The cuttlefish now came forward , and said to the person_2 : `` What I said was right.
You see the hook still sticks in the TAI 'S throat.
`` O please make haste and pull it out !"
`` All right , TAI SAN ,"
He then washed it and brought it to the person_2.
What had been done was done in heedlessness and not by intention.
So he begged the Sea person_2 to forgive his subject.
and was obliged to stay on for some time.
The years pass swiftly when any one is truly happy.
With your gracious permission , I will take my leave to-day.
I hope to make you another visit some day.
Please give up the idea of my staying longer now"
You have been a noble and honored guest and we have heartily made you welcome.
I hope you will not forget us.
The two Princesses bowed low , rose and glided out of the hall.
As the person_0 looked at them he wondered what they could be.
These two gems are called the nanjiu and the kanjiu"
`` The nanjiu ,"
After thanking his kind host again and again , he prepared to depart.
Never had he seen such a huge creature.
The Sea person_2 had ordered the monster to carry the person_0 back to Japan.
The Skillful Fisher stood amazed and terrified to see what was happening.
The Skillful Fisher promised and there was peace between the two brothers.
From this time he kept his word and became a good man and a kind brother.
This is the congratulatory ending of the person_0 and the Skillful Fisher"
There is a street in Copenhagen that has this strange name -- `` Hysken Straede"
and not `` Hysken"
-- in fact , it is several centuries ago.
The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck carried on trade with Copenhagen.
and this must be understood by all who wish to comprehend this history.
The `` pepper gentleman"
The boys sing , `` Cut , cut wood ! Poor bachelor so good.
Go , take your nightcap , go to rest , For ` tis the nightcap suits you best !"
Yes , that 's what they sing about the `` pepperer"
-LRB- Illustration : THE PEPPERER 'S BOOTH.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa In the old times the `` Housekin Street"
Behind the counters young men were seldom seen.
The old fellow was a subject for a painter.
His own native place was in Thuringia , the town of Eisenach , close by the Wartburg.
Old person_1 did not speak much of this , but he thought of it all the more.
The old clerks of the Haeuschen Street did not often come together.
It was certainly not an amusing life.
The plash of the water against the neighbouring rampart at the castle wharf could be plainly heard.
Such evenings are long and dreary , unless people devise some employment for themselves.
When he at last sought his couch , he used from habit to keep his nightcap on.
This he remembered very vividly.
The boy had red cheeks , and yellow curling hair , and honest blue eyes.
He was the son of the merchant person_1 -- it was himself.
The little girl had brown eyes and black hair , and had a bright clever look.
She was the burgomaster 's daughter person_0.
The two were playing with an apple.
They shook the apple , and heard the pips rattling in it.
`` Then you shall see ,"
she said , `` what will come out.
It will be something you do n't at all expect.
A whole apple tree will come out , but not directly"
And she put the pip in a flower-pot , and both were very busy and eager about it.
`` Now , you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has struck root ,"
said person_0.
`` That wo n't do at all.
I did it with my flowers ; but only twice.
`` Those are for me and person_0 ,"
said the boy.
`` That 's beautiful -- that 's marvellously beautiful !"
Soon a third leaf made its appearance.
Whom did that represent ? Yes , and there came another , and yet another.
In the neighborhood of Eisenach a row of stony mountains rises up.
It is called the Venus Mount.
In this mountain dwells Lady Venus , one of the deities of the heathen times.
-LRB- Illustration : IMPERTINENT MOLLY.
But person_1 did not dare.
_ I _ may kiss him !"
she would say proudly.
That was her vanity ; and person_1 submitted , and thought no more about it.
And the tree developed itself strongly , so that it could resist the winter.
In the autumn it brought two apples -- one for person_0 and one for person_1.
It could not well have produced less.
The tree had grown apace , and person_0 grew like the tree.
She was as fresh as an apple-blossom ; but person_1 was not long to behold this flower.
For person_0 told him she loved him -- loved him more than all the splendors of Weimar.
One , two , three years went by , and during this period two letters were received.
One came by a carrier , and a traveller brought the other.
The way was long and difficult , and passed through many windings by towns and villages.
He wished to come unexpectedly , and he came unexpectedly.
One may be admitted into a house and associate with a family without becoming one of them.
Yes , this was the kind of thing person_1 felt.
`` I am an honest girl ,"
said person_0 ; `` and I myself will tell you what it is.
Much has changed since we were children together -- changed inwardly and outwardly.
Habit and will have no power over our hearts.
You must reconcile yourself to this.
Farewell , person_1 !"
And person_1 bade her farewell.
`` What matter !"
person_1 's father ceased to be the richest of merchants.
The father became a poor man.
Sorrow and suffering took away his strength.
Then person_1 had to think of something else besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against person_0.
person_1 went to Bremen.
`` God 's will is best !"
he would say then.
That was a mercy of Providence towards me.
Everything has happened for the best.
And years went by.
person_1 's father was dead , and strangers lived in the old house.
But person_1 was destined to see it again.
The old Wartburg stood unchanged on the mountain , with `` the monk and the nun"
hewn out in stone.
The great oaks gave to the scene the outlines it had possessed in his childish days.
The Venus Mount glimmered gray and naked over the valley.
That was a sinful thought , and he blessed himself to drive it away.
`` That flourishes !"
he said.
`` The tree can grow !"
Nevertheless , one of the branches of the tree was broken.
`` Marry ! Ha , ha !"
he laughed bitterly to himself.
Winter had set in early ; it was freezing hard.
Forsaken by all , lay the old bachelor , unable to help himself.
It was not fever , nor sickness , but old age that had struck him down.
The time was very slow , and long , and dreary.
Tears he had none to shed , nor did he feel pain.
The thought of person_0 never came into his mind.
For a moment he felt a sensation of hunger -- of thirst.
Yes , he felt them both.
But nobody came to tend him -- nobody.
Her pious deeds shone bright upon his soul.
Yes , the roses seemed to unfold themselves in fragrance.
And the tree strewed down its fragrant leaves upon him , cooling his burning brow.
`` Now I shall sleep ,"
he whispered to himself.
`` Sleep is refreshing.
-LRB- Illustration : THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOUR LOOKS AFTER OLD ANTHONY.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa And he slept.
Do n't wish for such a cap for yourself.
He was immediately seized with dreams of unfortunate love , of bankruptcy , and of heavy times.
`` Hallo ! how the nightcap burns !"
he cried out , and tore it from his head.
And a pearl rolled out , and another , and another , and they sounded and glittered.
`` This must be gout ,"
said the burgomaster.
`` Something dazzles my eyes !"
They were tears , shed half a century before by old person_1 from Eisenach.
But some one else may tell _ them _.
We have told the first.
And our last word is -- do n't wish for `` The Old Bachelor 's Nightcap"
This was done.
For a whole year she never afforded him the pleasure of a single word.
Once more the king endeavored to get a word from his wife.
' The person_0 of person_1 , ravished to hear the fair slave speak , embraced her tenderly.
After the person_0 of person_1 had given this order , he returned to the fair slave again.
One day `` Sister ,"
` At this discourse of my brother 's , I fell into a violent passion.
`` Brother ,"
` The palaces of the kings and princes are very sumptuous and magnificent.
After that she bade her retire , and shut the door.
She had no sooner ended , than the sea began to be disturbed.
The company came forward , borne , as it were , upon the surface of the waves.
' She then related the whole of what had befallen her since she quitted the sea.
' But Queen Gulnare soon put him out of his fears.
He is a religious , wise , and temperate king.
Besides , I have a child , the little Prince Beder.
She went directly to the recess , and recovered the person_0 of person_1 from his surprise.
You see I am not alarmed ; neither in truth ought I to be so.
This made us come empty handed.
' Many tears were shed on both sides upon their separation.
'"
There was once a sultan of India who had three sons.
These , with the princess his niece , were the ornaments of his court.
Prince Houssain could not see this quarter without admiration.
It was thirty cubits long , and twenty broad , built of red marble , highly polished.
' Prince Ali accepted the merchant 's obliging offer , and presently the crier passed by.
Come with me , and I will pay you the money.
He who possesses it is master of a great treasure.
' ` But then , ' replied Prince Ali , ` you made a short stay there.
I will show you both the experiment whenever you please.
Take the tube , behold for yourselves the miserable state she is in.
The opportunity now presents itself to show you its wonderful virtue.
' The three princes had nothing to say against the decision of the sultan.
There were once upon a time two brothers , one rich and the other poor.
The rich one was a goldsmith and evil-hearted.
The poor one supported himself by making brooms , and was good and honorable.
and gave him a great deal of money for it.
and gave him what it was worth.
At last the goldsmith said , `` I should indeed like to have the bird itself"
`` Now I can get on ,"
thought he , and went contentedly home.
I have a fancy to eat it all myself"
The woman made the bird ready , put it on the spit , and let it roast.
`` Two little morsels which fell out of the bird ,"
answered they.
`` That must have been the heart and the liver ,"
The two children did not know what a piece of good-fortune had fallen to their lot.
At length they met with a huntsman , who asked , `` To whom do you children belong ?"
`` We are the poor broom-maker 's boys ,"
`` Come ,"
He did it , and thus accomplished his trial shot.
`` Now ,"
said the foster-father , `` I pronounce you out of your apprenticeship ; you are skilled huntsmen"
Said he , `` What , then , is your request ?"
Thereupon they ate and drank joyously together.
and loaded his gun , and looked about him.
and sprang instantly into the thicket , and brought two young ones.
They therefore kept them with them , and the little hares followed on foot.
The huntsmen put the two wolves beside the other animals , and they followed behind them.
The two young bears were added to the others , and there were already eight of them.
At length who came ? A lion came , and tossed his mane.
You are crafty and deep"
He went into an inn , and asked the host if he could accommodate his animals.
The huntsman inquired if she was `` sick unto death ?"
`` No ,"
answered the host , `` she is vigorous and healthy , nevertheless she must die !"
`` How is that ?"
asked the huntsman.
Said the huntsman , `` Why is the dragon not killed ?"
`` Ah ,"
It was not long before the seven-headed dragon came thither with loud roaring.
The huntsman answered , `` I want to fight with thee"
and he breathed fire out of seven jaws.
Then she said , `` yes ,"
and both fell asleep.
`` I can not do that ,"
she replied , `` for it was a huntsman with his animals who did it"
The King said to the maiden , `` Is what he says true ?"
`` Ah , yes ,"
for she thought in that time she should hear something of her dear huntsman.
The humble-bee came a second time , but the hare again rubbed it off and slept on.
Then it came for the third time , and stung his nose so that he awoke.
The bear asked the wolf , `` Why didst thou not waken me ?"
and the wolf the fox , `` Why didst thou not waken me ?"
and the fox the hare , `` Why didst thou not waken me ?"
The poor hare alone did not know what answer to make , and the blame rested with him.
But the mountain lies two hundred hours journey from here"
`` Nay ,"
said the host , `` I would bet a hundred pieces of gold that that will not come true"
`` Alas !"
Then she said , `` Wilt thou get away ?"
and thought it was her dog.
and thought it was her dog.
Then she peeped down , and knew the hare by its collar.
Then said the huntsman , `` Behold , sir host , the hundred pieces of gold are mine"
The host said , `` I should indeed like to see that ,"
but he would make no more wagers.
I am to ask for some roast meat such as the King is eating"
`` Behold , sir host ,"
`` Behold , sir host ,"
`` Behold , sir host ,"
Then the lion went to the royal apartment , and knocked at the door with his tail.
The lion said , `` I will go with him , and see that I get the right wine"
and he drew half a measure , and swallowed it down at one draught.
`` No ,"
said he , `` that is not right"
The lion said , `` Stop , let me taste the wine first ,"
and drew half a measure and drank it.
`` That is better , but still not right ,"
said he.
Then the cup-bearer grew angry and said , `` How can a stupid animal like you understand wine ?"
When the King heard the answer , he said to his daughter , `` What shall I do ?"
She answered , `` Go to meet him and you will do well"
Then the King went to meet him and led him in , and his animals followed.
and he unfolded the handkerchief , and there lay all seven inside it.
And he put each tongue in the mouth to which it belonged , and it fitted exactly.
Then the King asked his daughter , `` Is it true that this man killed the dragon ?"
And she answered , `` Yes , it is true.
The host said , `` Yes , according to justice it is so"
But the young King said , `` It shall be done according to mercy ,"
And now the young King and Queen were thoroughly happy , and lived in gladness together.
and he rode into the forest after it , followed only by his animals.
Then she was in the greatest concern about him.
He looked round , but could perceived nothing.
Said he , `` Come down , and warm thyself if thou art cold"
But she said , `` No , thy animals will bite me"
He answered , `` They will do thee no harm , old mother , do come down"
and then he rode into the forest and his animals ran after him.
Then he looked up , and the self-same witch was sitting in the tree.
Said he , `` If thou art cold , come down , little old mother , and warm thyself"
She answered , `` No , thy animals will bite me"
But he said , `` They will not hurt thee"
Come down , or I will fetch thee"
Then she cried , `` What dost thou want ? Thou shalt not touch me"
But he replied , `` If thou dost not come , I will shoot thee"
Said she , `` Shoot away , I do not fear thy bullets !"
Thereupon the two brothers went home together , and on the way told each other their histories.
cried he , `` and I have killed him for it ,"
and he bewailed him aloud.
The King said , `` It is not possible , the gates lie quite a mile apart"
Then the King said to the daughter , `` Say which is thy husband.
Each of them looks exactly like the other , I can not tell"
Then the young King laughed and said , `` Yes , he is the right one ,"
and they sat down together to table , and ate and drank , and were merry.
Then he knew how true his brother had been"
There could not be found in the whole of the Island Empire a happier little family.
`` Do not be anxious , I will come back soon ,"
said the man.
`` While I am away take care of everything , and especially of our little daughter"
`` Yes.
said the wife , while the tears fell like rain from her eyes.
But he knew that he must go , for the call was imperative.
`` Now father has gone , you and I must take care of everything till he comes back ,"
said the mother , as she made her way back to the house.
`` Yes , I will be very good ,"
`` Father is sure to bring you something that you want very much.
I know , for I asked him to bring you a doll.
You must think of father every day , and pray for a safe journey till he comes back"
`` O , yes , when he comes home again how happy I shall be ,"
Then she set to work to make the winter clothes for the three of them.
Thus did the wife find consolation in work during the lonely days of her husband 's absence.
Both the man and his wife rejoiced to find each other well.
`` Here ,"
he said to the little girl , `` is a present for you.
It is a prize for taking care of mother and the house so well while I was away"
`` Thank you ,"
The husband laughed and said : `` Why , it is your own face that you see.
There the mirror is considered a very necessary requisite for a woman to possess.
It is also one of the treasures that form the insignia of the Emperor.
So you must lay great store by your mirror , and use it carefully"
But , alas ! in this world nothing lasts forever.
So at last the happiness of this family was broken up by a great sorrow.
The good and gentle wife and mother was one day taken ill.
.
But in spite of all their efforts the woman 's life was not to be saved.
Her breath was labored and she spoke with difficulty : `` My daughter.
I am sure that nothing can save me now.
`` Oh , mother ,"
said the girl as the tears rushed to her eyes , `` you must not say such things.
And now I have something to give you whereby to remember me when I am gone"
This I give you before I die.
With these words the dying woman handed the mirror to her daughter.
In spite of this the daughter 's life seemed to her desolate.
She threw herself down in her mother 's room and wept as if her heart would break.
Suddenly she sat up.
Her mother 's last words had rung through her memory hitherto dulled by grief.
`` It is certainly my mother 's soul that I see.
She knows how miserable I am without her and she has come to comfort me.
Whenever I long to see her she will meet me here ; how grateful I ought to be !"
And from this time the weight of sorrow was greatly lightened for her young heart.
The woman soon saw that he began to show more concern for his lonely child than before.
So crooked did the woman 's heart become.
The woman herself was a little frightened too at what she had seen.
`` Do you find it so disagreeable ,"
he asked , `` in my house , that you can stay no longer ?"
And the woman began to weep afresh.
`` I will tell you since you ask me.
Your daughter dislikes me as her step-mother.
He decided to go at once to his daughter and try to find out the truth.
The girl had for a long time past been very unhappy.
But she soon found that her efforts were in vain.
It was the only comfort that she had in these wretched days.
Her father found her occupied in this way.
Pushing aside the fusama , he saw her bending over something or other very intently.
So before turning to her father she slipped the mirror into her long sleeve.
The girl was frightened by her father 's severity.
Never had he spoken to her in such a tone.
Her confusion changed to apprehension , her color from scarlet to white.
She sat dumb and shamefaced , unable to reply.
But she saw that she must speak and clear herself somehow.
She loved her father dearly , and could not bear the idea of his anger.
I am still your obedient child.
Indeed , I am.
He wished to clear up his doubts once for all.
So she slipped the mirror out from her long sleeve and laid it before him.
`` This ,"
she said , `` is what you saw me looking at just now"
`` Why ,"
he said in great surprise"
`` What do you mean ?"
he asked.
`` It is indeed true ,"
said the girl : `` and if you do n't believe what I say , look for yourself ,"
and she placed the mirror before her.
There , looking back from the smooth metal disk , was her own sweet face.
She pointed to the reflection seriously : `` Do you doubt me still ?"
she asked earnestly , looking up into his face.
With an exclamation of sudden understanding the father smote his two hands together.
`` How stupid I am ! At last I understand.
Living in constant remembrance of your lost mother has helped you to grow like her in character.
How clever it was of her to tell you to do this.
Before you I have no countenance left , and I beg you to forgive me"
And here the father wept.
`` I am ashamed ! I am ashamed !"
she exclaimed in broken tones.
`` I did not know what n filial child you were.
I shall think of you as a child that I have borne myself.
Thus did the unkind step-mother humble herself and ask forgiveness of the girl she had so wronged.
From this time on , the three lived together as happily as fish in water.
Her patience and goodness were rewarded at last"
Mrs.
When it became known that the old fox was dead , wooers presented themselves.
The maid heard some one standing at the house-door , knocking.
`` No , thank you , miss ,"
said the fox , `` what is Mrs.
Fox doing ?"
Fox is dead"
`` Certainly , young sir"
`` Oh yes , my little cat ,"
she cried.
`` A wooer he stands at the door out there"
`` Tell me what he is like , my dear ?"
`` But has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr.
Fox ?"
`` Oh , no ,"
answered the cat , `` he has only one"
`` Then I will not have him"
Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away.
Fox.
He had two tails , but he did not fare better than the first.
Fox.
Fox outside"
But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized , old Mr.
Fox stirred under the bench , and cudgelled all the rabble , and drove them and Mrs.
Fox out of the house.
SECOND STORY When old Mr.
Fox , opened it for him.
The wolf greeted her , and said , `` Good day , Mrs.
Cat of Kehrewit , `` How comes it that alone you sit ? What are you making good ?"
`` No , thank you , Mrs.
Cat ,"
answered the wolf.
`` Is Mrs.
Fox not at home ?"
Fox is no more"
Fox asked , `` Has the gentleman red stockings on ' and has he a pointed mouth ?"
`` No ,"
answered the cat.
`` Then he wo n't do for me"
But one of the good points which old Mr.
At length came a young fox.
Then Mrs.
Fox said , `` Has the gentleman red stockings on , and has he a little pointed mouth ?"
`` Yes ,"
said the cat , `` he has"
`` Then let him come upstairs ,"
said Mrs.
Fox , and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding-feast.
Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr.
`` What !"
`` I am Death ,"
answered the other.
`` No one resists me , and thou also must obey my commands"
But the giant refused , and began to struggle with Death.
`` What will be done now ,"
`` Dost thou know ,"
`` No ,"
answered the youth , `` I do not know thee"
`` I am Death ,"
said he.
`` Well ,"
`` Die , I shall not ,"
As soon as he felt himself well again he began once more to live merrily.
Then one day some one tapped him on the shoulder.
`` What ,"
`` Silence !"
answered Death.
`` I come from Rome ,"
said the Moon.
Peter 's.
On her head she carried an earthen pitcher of antique shape filled with water.
Her feet were bare , her short frock and her white sleeves were torn.
I kissed her pretty round shoulders , her dark eyes , and black shining hair.
She burst into tears.
But the maiden took it to heart daily , and thought she must deliver her brothers.
And now she went continually onwards , far , far to the very end of the world.
`` I am looking for my brothers , the seven ravens ,"
she replied.
And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass , the ring rolled against his mouth.
And they embraced and kissed each other , and went joyfully home"
`` I looked through the windows of an editor 's house ,"
said the Moon.
`` It was somewhere in Germany.
I saw handsome furniture , many books , and a chaos of newspapers.
` This one has been sent to me , ' said he.
But what will you have ? You ca n't be always getting something new.
He is well read , a remarkable Oriental scholar , and has a good judgment.
It was he who wrote that nice review of my ` Reflections on Domestic Life.
' We must be lenient towards the young man.
'"
` But he is a complete hack ! ' objected another of the gentlemen.
` Nothing is worse in poetry than mediocrity , and he certainly does not go beyond this.
'"
` Poor fellow , ' observed a third , ` and his aunt is so happy about him.
It was she , Mr.
Editor , who got together so many subscribers for your last translation.
'"
` Ah , the good woman ! Well , I have noticed the book briefly.
He has genius , certainly ; do n't you think so ? '"
The punctuation of the book , in particular , is very eccentric.
'"
'"
` But that would be unfair , ' objected the fourth.
'"
` Not so.
If he is a true genius , he can bear the sharp voice of censure.
There are people enough to praise him.
Do n't let us quite turn his head.
'"
` Decided talent , ' wrote the editor , ` with the usual carelessness.
We recommend him to study the ancients , etc.
' `` I went away ,"
continued the Moon , `` and looked through the windows in the aunt 's house.
But it must be allowed that , as a man , you are highly respectable.
' `` A young girl sat in a corner ; and she read in a book these words :"
` In the dust lies genius and glory , But ev ` ry-day talent will _ pay _.
It 's only the old , old story , But the piece is repeated each day.
'"
Then he thanked her , and ascended again.
`` Why should we give ourselves a great deal of trouble to search ?"
Then the father said , `` He who brings me the most beautiful ring shall inherit the kingdom ,"
The two eldest laughed at Simpleton for going to seek a golden ring.
He again blew the three feathers into the air , and they flew as before.
`` Oh ,"
She gave him a yellow turnip which had been hollowed out , to which six mice were harnessed.
Then Simpleton said quite mournfully , `` What am I to do with that ?"
The toad answered , `` Just put one of my little toads into it"
When the King saw them he said , `` After my death the kingdom belongs to my youngest son"
The aged King agreed likewise to this.
So he received the crown , and has ruled wisely for a length of time"
A countryman was once going out to plough with a pair of oxen.
On the way , however , he lost one seed out of the bag.
`` If I were to fall down from hence it would be a bad thing ,"
But he came down on the earth exactly in the middle of a deep , deep hole.
There was once on a time a far-sighted , crafty peasant whose tricks were much talked about.
`` Thou dost indeed sit upon a treasure !"
said the peasant.
`` Yes , in truth ,"
`` The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me ,"
said the peasant.
`` It is thine ,"
Money I have enough of , but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth"
The peasant agreed to the bargain.
`` In order , however , that no dispute may arise about the division ,"
The Devil was quite satisfied with that , but the cunning peasant had sown turnips.
`` Thou hast had the best of it for once ,"
said the Devil , `` but the next time that wo n't do.
What grows above ground shall be thine , and what is under it , mine"
`` I am willing ,"
`` That is the way to cheat the Devil ,"
said the peasant , and went and fetched away the treasure"
and with that he chased him into the open country.
`` Alas ,"
replied the horse , `` avarice and fidelity do not dwell together in one house.
`` Without giving thee a chance ?"
asked the fox.
`` The chance was a bad one.
Then up sprang the horse at once , and drew the lion away with him.
and he gave him plenty to eat until he died"
There were once a cock and a hen who wanted to take a journey together.
The hen seated herself in it with the cock , and they drove away together.
Not long afterwards they met a cat who said , `` Where are you going ?"
The cock replied , `` We are going to the house of Herr Korbes"
`` Take me with you ,"
said the cat.
Take great care not to dirty my little red wheels.
When , however , they reached the house of Herr Korbes , Herr Korbes was not there.
The cat sat down by the hearth , the duck on the well-pole.
Herr Korbes must have been a very wicked man !"
SAID one , a princely husband I have got.
For pleasure never gives me full delight , Unless a little pain the bliss invite.
Down William came.
Wife Too much is this : -- such accusations grieve.
Husband Thou did ` st most clearly suffer his embrace.
Wife I ? WHY , you dream ! Husband This seems a curious case.
Be that as ` twill , to-night from hence you go.
Still he thought within himself , `` Surely my father 's prophecy never proved untrue.
I must survive this calamity to find my death on some sea-coast"
At last he succeeded ; heaven threw in his way a ruined well.
For the last three days I have had nothing.
Fortune has sent you here.
If you assist me now you will find a sure help in me throughout your life.
Do not think that I am a beast of prey.
When you have become my deliverer I will never touch you.
Pray , kindly lift me up"
No ; that he will not do.
For my father 's prophecy never came untrue.
I must die on a sea coast , and not by a tiger"
The tiger reached the top of the well and felt himself on safe ground.
True to his word , he did no harm to person_0.
In return for this kind assistance I pledge my oath to stand by you in all calamities.
Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me.
I am there with you ready to oblige you by all the means that I can.
I chased him.
In the second lives a serpent half-famished with hunger.
In the same way the goldsmith also may ask you.
Goldsmiths are never to be trusted.
But never trust a goldsmith.
Thus advising , the hungry tiger went away without waiting for an answer.
But still his thirst was not quenched.
Release me now.
Oblige me : I am dying"
person_0 , calling again to mind the `` DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE"
of the prophecy lifted him up.
I chased him.
He fell into this well.
I am going away now to see my father.
Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me.
I will be there by your side to assist you by all possible means"
Whenever you are in any calamity just think of me.
I will come to you , and assist you.
It is nothing but a sad truth that goldsmiths ought never to be trusted.
Therefore , never assist him as you have done to us all.
And if you do , you will suffer for it.
I am hungry ; let me go for the present"
Thus taking leave of his benefactor , the rat , too , ran away.
So thinking to himself , person_0 let down the vessel again.
The goldsmith caught hold of it , and demanded help.
The Soothsayer 's son had no time to lose ; he was himself dying of thirst.
Therefore he lifted the goldsmith up , who now began his story.
`` Stop for a while ,"
I am just now dying of hunger.
Permit me to go away.
My name is Manikkasari.
`` I have secured enough merit now by my religious observances.
Let me return home"
Thus thought person_0 within himself , and very soon he was on his way back to his country.
I can never forget the day when I owed my life to your lotus hands.
I have several jewels with me of little value.
Much more , therefore , must Manikkasari be faithful.
I do not want anything from him now.
It may also excite the curiosity of some robbers on the way.
I will go now to Ujjaini on my way.
Manikkasari requested me to see him without failure on my return journey.
He must do that kindness at least for me.
I shall then roll up these diamonds and gold ball in my rags , and wend my way homewards"
Thus thinking and thinking , he reached Ujjaini.
At once he inquired for the house of his goldsmith friend , and found him without difficulty.
All of a sudden the tiger-king started from the wood , seized the king , and vanished.
`` He is bathing in the river , and is of such and such appearance ,"
was the reply.
Such was the cellar into which person_0 was thrust.
We are all the children of fate.
We must obey her commands.
This is but the first day of my father 's prophecy.
So far his statement is true.
But how pass ten years ? That can not be , and I must die.
Before death comes let me think of my faithful brute friends"
So pondered person_0 in the dark cell underground , and at that moment thought of his three friends.
The rat raja issued an order at once to that effect to his army.
After reaching it they found that their teeth could not work on the hard stones.
Thus a passage was effected.
He will squeeze them and gather water for drink ! and the bread and sweetmeats shall form his food"
Having issued these orders , the king of the rats took leave of person_0.
The king of the rats has promised to do his best to provide you with food.
We would now do what we can for your release.
From that day these calamities have broken out in his dominions.
Every day people were carried away by tigers or bitten by serpents.
Thus passed months and years.
Thus passed full ten years , as prophesied in the horoscope.
Ten complete years rolled away in close imprisonment.
She breathed her last.
She was the only daughter of the king.
The king at once sent for all the snake-bite curers.
The king at once ordered the cell to be examined.
There was the man sitting in it.
Thus they discussed , while they brought person_0 to the king.
The king no sooner saw person_0 than he fell on the ground.
He was struck by the majesty and grandeur of his person.
His hair had first to be cut before his face could be seen.
The king begged forgiveness for his former fault , and requested him to revive his daughter.
were the only words that person_0 spoke.
Cartloads of corpses of men and cattle began to come in every minute.
All rose up as if from deep slumber , and went to their respective homes.
The princess , too , was restored to life.
The joy of the king knew no bounds.
`` I shall there call in all the tigers and serpents , and give them a general order"
People began to take to their heels at the sight of tigers.
person_0 assured them of safety , and stopped them.
`` Care not for it ; it may be by magic.
That is not a great thing.
That he revived cartloads of corpses shows him to be surely person_0 ,"
said others.
I was the messenger of death sent to deal the blow on his neck.
I did it , and gave the crown to your honor.
The prince makes no inquiry , and at once imprisons your honor.
The gold-smith fled for his life.
All returned to their homes.
The king again pressed person_0 to accept the hand of his daughter.
He agreed to do so , not then , but some time afterwards.
The king agreed ; and person_0 left the city that very day on his way home.
His elder brother was also on his way up to Benares by that very same route.
They met and recognized each other , even at a distance.
They flew into each other 's arms.
Both remained still for a time almost unconscious with joy.
The pleasure of person_0 was so great that he died of joy.
The elder brother was a devout worshipper of Ganesa.
That was a Friday , a day very sacred to that god.
The elder brother took the corpse to the nearest Ganesa temple and called upon him.
The god came , and asked him what he wanted.
`` My poor brother is dead and gone ; and this is his corpse.
Kindly keep it in your charge till I finish worshipping you.
Ganesa made over the corpse to his Ganas , asking them to watch over it carefully.
But instead of that they devoured it.
The elder brother , after finishing the puja , demanded his brother 's corpse of the god.
The god was greatly enraged.
The elder brother was very angry.
Ganesa was much ashamed at the remark.
Thus was the second son of the Soothsayer restored to life.
The brothers had a long talk about each other 's adventures.
He reigned for a long time , conferring several benefits upon his brother.
And so the horoscope was fully fulfilled"
A mortal was allowed these charms to view , Which others ' eyes could never dare pursue.
Such treasures were for gods , or rather kings The privilege of both are beauteous things.
A tempting journey truly it appears , For youths from twenty on to thirty years.
He criticised whatever passed around , And oft , at others ' cost , diversion found.
Beneath their veils were beauteous sparkling eyes ; The holy-water scarcely would suffice.
By this time I 'm convinced her loving spouse.
We made haste to do so , and set sail with all possible diligence.
The mariners and passengers were all killed by the stone , or sunk.
I overcame that difficulty however , and got ashore.
It seemed to be a delicious garden.
I went towards him and saluted him , but he only bowed his head a little.
They were extremely surprised to see me , and to hear the particulars of my adventures.
The vessel in which I came sailed with merchants who loaded her with cocoa-nuts.
I expected the arrival of another , whose merchants landed speedily for the like loading.
We set sail towards the islands where pepper grows in great plenty.
I hired divers , who fetched me up those that were very large and pure.
They found it at last , but we had no reason to rejoice at it.
He threw off his turban , pulled his beard , and beat his head like a madman.
All these objects served only to augment our grief.
Then a pleasing sleep fell upon me.
I got up as soon as I saw them and saluted them.
They spoke to me , but I did not understand their language.
I told them I was ready to do whatever they pleased.
We conjure you this in the rank of a brother.
Farewell.
And fourthly , a she-slave of ravishing beauty , whose apparel was covered all over with jewels.
I made my reverence , and after a short speech gave him the letter and present.
There is nothing more capable of raising a man 's admiration than the magnificence of his palace.
And the officer in front replies , `` Praise be to Him who lives for ever"
` Further , the King of Serendib is so just that there are no judges in his dominions.
His people have no need of them.
They understand and observe justice of themselves.
' The caliph was much pleased with my discourse.
' Having spoken thus he dismissed me , and sent me home with a rich present"
To be precipitate , in such a case , Perhaps might lead at once to dire disgrace.
At night howe'er the horn was heard once more , And terrified the females as before.
Six steps behind , the beauteous daughter stood , And waited the decree she thought so good.
The hypocrite howe'er the hermit played , And sent these humble pilgrims back dismayed.
The mother with him let her girl remain , And hastened to her humble roof again.
O HYPOCRITES ! how oft your wily art Deceives the world and causes poignant smart.
AT matins they so very often met , Some awkward indications caused regret.
For sev ` n long months the nymph her visits paid ; Her inexperience doubtless wanted aid.
I rose from the table , and went to him.
It is but just I should return his civility.
' This command of the caliph to me was like a clap of thunder.
I have also made a vow never to go out of Bagdad.
After that you are at liberty to return.
That prince knew me immediately , and testified very great joy to see me.
Farewell.
' The King of Serendib was highly pleased that the caliph returned his friendship.
God ordered it otherwise.
Some of the crew offered resistance , which cost them their lives.
, to trade with.
I confess to you that this furnished me with abundance of reflections.
Pray tell me what befell you , and by what good hap you are still alive.
I declare before Him that I give you your liberty.
I concealed from you what I am now going to tell you.
God has delivered you from their fury , and has bestowed that favor upon you only.
You have procured me incredible gain.
' To this obliging discourse I replied , ` Patron , God preserve you.
I will send you home then , and give you wherewith to pay your expenses.
' I thanked him again for my liberty , and his good intentions towards me.
After I had returned him a thousand thanks for all his favors , I went on board.
We stopped at some islands to take in fresh provisions.
All these fatigues ended at last , and I came safe to Bagdad.
I went immediately to wait upon the caliph , and gave him an account of my embassy.
`` Melancholy ! Why do you say that ?"
the Ephemera would then always reply.
`` But only one day , and then it 's all done !"
`` Done !"
repeated the Ephemera.
`` What 's the meaning of _ done _ ? Are you _ done _ , too ?"
`` No ? then I do n't understand you.
Does all the beauty of this world cease when you die ?"
`` No ,"
replied the Tree ; `` it will certainly last much longer -- far longer than I can possibly think"
`` Well , then , we have the same time , only that we reckon differently"
`` Poor little Ephemera !"
said the Oak.
`` That was a terribly short life !"
Winter was approaching.
Already the storms were singing their `` good night , good night !"
Here fell a leaf , and there fell a leaf.
Sweet sleep to you , and pleasant dreams !"
The great Oak had once been small -- indeed , an acorn had been its cradle.
According to human computation , it was now in its fourth century.
It was just at the holy Christmas time , when the tree dreamed its most glorious dream.
The hunting horn sounded , and the dogs barked.
The watch-fires flamed up anew , and men sang and slept under the branches of the tree.
-LRB- Illustration : THE LOVERS AT THE OLD OAK TREE.
The birch was the quickest of all.
`` But the little blue flower by the water-side , where is that ?"
said the Oak ; `` and the purple bell-flower and the daisy ?"
for , you see , the old Oak Tree wanted to have them all about him.
`` We are here -- we are here !"
was shouted and sung in reply.
`` We are here , we are here !"
replied voices still higher in the air.
It seemed as if they had flown on before.
`` Why , that is beautiful , indescribably beautiful !"
exclaimed the old Oak Tree , rejoicingly.
`` In heaven , in the better land , it can be imagined , and it is possible !"
the reply sounded through the air.
`` That 's right , that 's better than all !"
said the tree.
He fell.
His three hundred and sixty-five years were now as the single day of the Ephemera.
On the morning of the Christmas festival , when the sun rose , the storm had subsided.
`` The tree is down -- the old Oak Tree , our landmark on the coast !"
said the sailors.
`` It fell in the storm of last night.
Who can replace it ? No one can"
He slept thus till morning.
We returned to the palace towards evening , and the giant arrived a little while after.
We were forced to see another of our comrades roasted.
But at last we revenged ourselves on the brutish giant thus.
We entered the port , and came to anchor.
The merchants began to unload their goods , in order to sell or exchange them.
' ` You believe him then to be dead ? ' said I.
` Certainly , ' answered he.
I fell asleep by a brook , and when I awoke I found all the company gone.
I restore them to you , with the profit I have made on them.
I saw another which had the shape and color of a camel.
The pleasures I took after my third voyage had not charms enough to divert me from another.
I was again prevailed upon by my passion for traffic and curiosity to see new things.
I ate of it also , but very sparingly.
The fear of death under which I labored turned all my food into poison.
This I took to be a good omen , and went to them without any scruple.
They presented me to their king , who was a good prince.
I observed one thing which to me appeared very extraordinary.
All the people , the king himself not excepted , rode their horses without bridle or stirrups.
This made me one day take the liberty to ask the king how that came to pass.
I have one thing to demand of thee , which thou must grant.
This is a law which our ancestors established in this island , and always observed inviolably.
Nothing can save me ; every one must submit to this law.
The husband walked at the head of the company , and followed the corpse.
The mountain was pretty long , and reached to the sea.
The ceremony being over , they covered the hole again with the stone , and returned.
I could not forbear speaking my thoughts on this matter to the king.
I shall be interred with the queen , my wife , if she die first.
But thou hast drawn all this upon thyself by thy cursed avarice.
This island produces lead from its mines , Indian canes , and excellent camphor.
The inhabitants are so barbarous that they still eat human flesh.
The bird 's work was to fly every day into the forest and bring back wood.
He who is too well off is always longing for something new.
They were much troubled , but agreed to do their best and remain together.
When the bird came to carry up the dinner , no cook was there.
Then a snail came running up and killed two furious lions.
Then a cock crowed , Cock-a - doodle-doo ! The story is all told , -- Cock-a-doodle-doo !"
`` Ah ,"
`` Yes , my child ,"
`` Mother ,"
said the little daughter , `` is brother not to have one too ?"
This made the woman angry , but she said , `` Yes , when he comes out of school"
Then she threw the apple into the chest , and shut it.
and she looked wickedly at him.
`` Mother ,"
said the little boy , `` how dreadful you look ! Yes , give me an apple"
and she opened the lid of the chest and said , `` Take out an apple for thyself ,"
`` Mother ,"
`` Go back to him ,"
So Marlinchen went to him and said , `` Brother , give me the apple"
and she wept and wept and could not be comforted.
`` Marlinchen ,"
Then the father again said , `` But where is my son ?"
`` Ah ,"
`` And what is he going to do there ? He did not even say good-bye to me"
`` Ah ,"
said the man , `` I feel so unhappy lest all should not be right.
He ought to have said good-bye to me"
Then he said , `` Ah , wife , how delicious this food is , give me some more"
It seems to me as if it were all mine"
Marlinchen , however , was as gay and happy as if her brother were still alive.
And she went merrily into the house , and sat down to dinner and ate.
He stood up , but as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers.
Then he went right on and stood still , and said to the bird , `` Bird ,"
said he then , `` how beautifully thou canst sing ! Sing me that piece again"
`` No ,"
`` There ,"
said the goldsmith , `` there is the golden chain for thee , now sing me that song again"
`` Bird ,"
said he , `` how beautifully thou canst sing !"
`` Bird ,"
said the shoemaker , `` now sing me that song again"
`` Nay ,"
said the bird , `` I do not sing twice for nothing ; thou must give me something"
`` Wife ,"
Then the wife went and brought the shoes.
`` There , bird ,"
said the man , `` now sing me that piece again"
And when he had sung the whole he flew away.
Then one of them stopped working , `` My father he ate me"
Then two more stopped working and listened to that , `` My sister , little Marlinchen ,"
Then four more stopped , `` Gathered together all my bones , Tied them in a silken handkerchief ,"
Now eight only were hewing , `` Laid them beneath"
Now only five , `` The juniper-tree ,"
And now only one , `` Kywitt , kywitt , what a beautiful bird am I !"
Then the last stopped also , and heard the last words.
`` Bird ,"
said he , `` how beautifully thou singest ! Let me , too , hear that.
Sing that once more for me"
`` Nay ,"
said the bird , `` I will not sing twice for nothing.
Give me the millstone , and then I will sing it again"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` if it belonged to me only , thou shouldst have it"
`` Yes ,"
said the others , `` if he sings again he shall have it"
`` Nay ,"
said the mother , `` I feel so uneasy , just as if a heavy storm were coming"
`` Nay ,"
Then the bird sat on the juniper tree , and sang , `` My mother she killed me ,"
`` Ah , mother ,"
`` My sister , little Marlinchen ,"
`` Oh , do n't go ,"
said the woman , `` I feel as if the whole house were shaking and on fire"
Then sang the bird once more , `` My mother she killed me"
`` Would that I were a thousand feet beneath the earth so as not to hear that !"
`` My father he ate me ,"
Then the woman fell down again as if dead.
`` My sister , little Marlinchen ,"
`` Ah ,"
said Marlinchen , `` I too will go out and see if the bird will give me anything ,"
and she went out.
`` Gathered together all my bones , Tied them in a silken handkerchief ,"
Then he threw down the shoes to her.
`` Laid them beneath the juniper-tree , Kywitt , kywitt , what a beautiful bird am I !"
`` Ah ,"
`` Well ,"
`` If the feather is so precious ,"
`` How can such a silly beast give wise advice ?"
thought the King 's son , and he pulled the trigger.
But he missed the Fox , who stretched out his tail and ran quickly into the wood.
`` I should be a fool , indeed ,"
He could not resist , but went inside and lived only for pleasure.
`` It is of no use ,"
But at last , as he had no peace , he let him go.
`` You shall not repent it ,"
When he came to the castle he found everything as the Fox had said.
`` But ,"
so he opened the door , laid hold of it , and put it into the golden cage.
But at the same moment the bird uttered a shrill cry.
The soldiers awoke , rushed in , and took him off to prison.
`` Look you ,"
said the Fox , `` this has happened because you did not give heed to me.
However , be of good courage.
I will give you my help , and tell you how to get to the Golden Horse.
But scarcely had the golden saddle touched the horse than he began to neigh loudly.
The grooms awoke , seized the youth , and threw him into prison.
`` I ought only to leave you to your ill-luck ,"
When he reached the Golden Castle it was just as the Fox had said.
Then he sprang out and gave her a kiss.
If you do that you shall have my daughter as your reward"
The next morning when he awoke and looked out of the window the hill had gone.
`` You have certainly got what is best ,"
said he , `` but the Golden Horse also belongs to the maiden of the Golden Castle"
`` How shall I get it ?"
asked the youth.
`` That I will tell you ,"
`` What do you require for it ?"
asked the youth.
`` That would be fine gratitude ,"
said the King 's son.
`` I can not possibly do that for you"
Be careful about two things.
Buy no gallows ' - flesh , and do not sit at the edge of any well"
And then he ran into the wood.
He inquired whether they could not be set free.
`` If you will pay for them ,"
`` Here we bring you not only the Golden Bird ,"
said they ; `` we have won the Golden Horse also , and the maiden from the Golden Castle"
But the youngest brother was not dead.
`` But yet I can not give it up so ,"
he said ; `` I will help you up again into daylight"
`` You are not out of all danger yet ,"
said the Fox.
The King , astonished , asked , `` What does this mean ?"
and again he asked him with tears to shoot him dead and chop off his head and feet.
And now nothing more was wanting to their happiness as long as they lived"
`` Come ,"
Then the Fisherman got up and went home to his wife in the hovel.
`` Husband ,"
said the woman , `` have you caught nothing to-day ?"
`` No ,"
`` Did you not wish for anything first ?"
said the woman.
`` No ,"
said the man ; `` what should I wish for ?"
`` Ah ,"
Go back and call him.
Tell him we want to have a small cottage , he will certainly give us that"
`` Ah ,"
said the man , `` why should I go there again ?"
`` Why ,"
Go at once"
Then the person_0 came swimming to him and said , `` Well what does she want , then ?"
`` Ah ,"
She does not like to live in a wretched hovel any longer.
She would like to have a cottage"
`` Go , then ,"
said the person_0 , `` she has it already"
`` Look ,"
said the wife , `` is not that nice !"
`` Yes ,"
`` We will think about that ,"
said the wife.
With that they ate something and went to bed.
`` Ah , wife ,"
`` What !"
said the woman ; `` just go there , the person_0 can always do that"
`` No , wife ,"
`` Go ,"
The man 's heart grew heavy , and he would not go.
He said to himself , `` It is not right ,"
and yet he went.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said the man , half scared , `` she wants to live in a great stone castle"
`` Go to it , then , she is standing before the door ,"
said the person_0.
`` Come ,"
said the woman , `` is n't that beautiful ?"
`` Yes , indeed ,"
`` We will consider about that ,"
said the woman , `` and sleep upon it ;"
thereupon they went to bed.
`` Ah , wife ,"
said the man , `` why should we be King ? I do not want to be King"
`` Well ,"
`` Ah , wife ,"
`` Why not ?"
said the woman ; `` go to him this instant ; I must be King !"
So the man went , and was quite unhappy because his wife wished to be King.
`` It is not right ; it is not right ,"
thought he.
He did not wish to go , but yet he went.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said the man , `` she wants to be King"
`` Go to her ; she is King already"
`` Yes ,"
said the woman , `` now I am King"
`` Nay , husband ,"
`` Alas , wife , why do you wish to be Emperor ?"
`` Husband ,"
said she , `` go to the person_0.
I will be Emperor"
`` Alas , wife ,"
There is only one Emperor in the land.
An Emperor the person_0 can not make you ! I assure you he can not"
`` What !"
I will be Emperor ; go instantly"
So he was forced to go.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas , person_0 ,"
said he , `` my wife wants to be Emperor"
`` Go to her ,"
said the person_0 ; `` she is Emperor already"
Then they opened the doors to him , which were of pure gold.
And before it stood a number of princes and dukes.
`` Yes ,"
said she , `` now I am Emperor"
`` Husband ,"
`` Alas , wife ,"
said the man , `` what will you not wish for ? You can not be Pope.
There is but one in Christendom.
He can not make you Pope"
`` Husband ,"
said she , `` I will be Pope ; go immediately , I must be Pope this very day"
`` No , wife ,"
`` Husband ,"
said she , `` what nonsense ! If he can make an emperor he can make a pope.
Go to him directly.
I am Emperor , and you are nothing but my husband ; will you go at once ?"
For my wife , good Ilsabil , Wills not as I 'd have her will.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said the man , `` she wants to be Pope"
`` Go to her then ,"
said the person_0 ; `` she is Pope already"
He pushed his way through the crowd.
`` Wife ,"
said the man , and looked attentively at her , `` are you now Pope ?"
`` Yes ,"
said she , `` I am Pope"
`` I will consider about that ,"
said the woman.
`` Husband ,"
The man was still half asleep , but he was so horrified that he fell out of bed.
`` Husband ,"
`` Alas , wife ,"
Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman.
`` Well , what does she want , then ?"
said the person_0.
`` Alas ,"
said he , `` she wants to be like unto God"
`` Go to her , and you will find her back again in the dirty hovel"
And there they are living still at this very time"
`` Dearest child ,"
she answered , `` I may not tell thee"
After she had blessed her sons therefore , they went forth into the forest.
Then the Queen answered with a heavy heart , `` Dear child , these belong to thy twelve brothers"
Said the maiden , `` Where are my twelve brothers , I have never yet heard of them ?"
She replied , `` God knows where they are , they are wandering about the world"
`` These coffins ,"
So she took the twelve shirts and went forth , and straight into the great forest.
She walked the whole day , and in the evening she came to the bewitched hut.
She likewise showed him the twelve shirts which belonged to them.
But after this he said , `` Dear sister , there is still one difficulty.
`` No ,"
Said Benjamin , `` Do n't you know anything ?"
`` No ,"
they answered.
`` Tell us then ,"
they cried.
He answered , `` But promise me that the first maiden who meets us shall not be killed"
`` Yes ,"
they all cried , `` she shall have mercy , only do tell us"
Then said he , `` Our sister is here ,"
Now she stayed at home with Benjamin and helped him with the work.
The maiden said , weeping , `` Is there no way of delivering them ?"
`` No ,"
She made no answer , but nodded a little with her head.
`` I shall win the princess !"
So cried both of them.
Therefore their old papa gave to each a handsome horse.
`` Hallo !"
`` We 're going to the king 's court , as suitors to the king 's daughter.
Do n't you know the announcement that has been made all through the country ?"
And they told him all about it.
`` My word ! I 'll be in it too !"
cried Jack the Dullard ; and his two brothers burst out laughing at him , and rode away.
`` Father dear ,"
said Jack , `` I must have a horse too.
`` Do n't talk nonsense ,"
replied the old gentleman.
`` You shall have no horse from me.
You do n't know how to speak -- you ca n't arrange your words.
Your brothers are very different fellows from you"
`` Well ,"
And so said , so done.
`` Hei , houp ! that was a ride ! Here I come !"
shouted Jack the Dullard , and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide.
But his brothers rode slowly on in advance of him.
`` Hallo !"
shouted Jack the Dullard.
`` Here am I ! Look what I have found on the high-road"
And he showed them what it was , and it was a dead crow.
`` Dullard !"
exclaimed the brothers , `` what are you going to do with that ?"
`` With the crow ? why , I am going to give it to the princess"
`` Yes , do so ,"
said they ; and they laughed , and rode on.
And the brothers turned round to see what he could have found now.
`` Dullard !"
`` Most certainly I shall ,"
and there was Jack the Dullard again.
`` It is getting better and better ,"
he cried.
`` Hurrah ! it is quite famous"
`` Why , what have you found this time ?"
inquired the brothers.
`` Oh ,"
said Jack the Dullard , `` I can hardly tell you.
How glad the princess will be !"
`` Bah !"
said the brothers ; `` that is nothing but clay out of the ditch"
`` Yes , certainly it is ,"
said Jack the Dullard ; `` and clay of the finest sort.
See , it is so wet , it runs through one 's fingers"
And he filled his pocket with the clay.
`` It is dreadfully hot here !"
observed the first brother.
`` Yes ,"
replied the princess , `` my father is going to roast young pullets to-day"
`` Baa !"
there he stood like a baa-lamb.
`` Baa !"
`` He is of no use !"
said the princess.
`` Away with him"
And he was obliged to go accordingly.
And now the second brother came in.
`` It is terribly warm here !"
he observed.
`` Yes , we 're roasting pullets to-day ,"
replied the princess.
`` What -- what were you -- were you pleased to ob --"
stammered he -- and all the clerks wrote down , `` pleased to ob --"
`` He is of no use !"
said the princess.
`` Away with him !"
Now came the turn of Jack the Dullard.
He rode into the hall on his goat.
`` Well , it 's most abominably hot here"
`` Yes , because I 'm roasting young pullets ,"
replied the princess.
`` Ah , that 's lucky !"
`` With the greatest pleasure ,"
said the princess.
`` But have you anything you can roast it in ? for I have neither pot nor pan"
`` Certainly I have !"
said Jack.
`` Here 's a cooking utensil with a tin handle"
And he brought out the old wooden shoe , and put the crow into it.
`` Well , that _ is _ a famous dish !"
said the princess.
`` But what shall we do for sauce ?"
`` Oh , I have that in my pocket ,"
and he poured some of the clay out of his pocket.
`` I like that !"
said the princess.
`` Oh , those are the gentlemen , are they ?"
said Jack ; `` then I will give the best I have to the head clerk"
`` That was very cleverly done ,"
observed the princess.
`` I could not have done that ; but I shall learn in time"
`` It 's so wonderfully cold that my whole body crackles !"
said the person_0.
He meant the sun , which was just about to set.
`` It shall not make _ me _ wink -- I shall manage to keep the pieces"
He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head instead of eyes.
His mouth was made of an old rake , and consequently was furnished with teeth.
`` There it comes again from the other side ,"
said the person_0.
He intended to say the sun is showing himself again.
`` Ah ! I have cured him of staring.
Now let him hang up there and shine , that I may see myself.
`` Away ! away !"
barked the old Yard Dog.
He was quite hoarse , and could not pronounce the genuine `` bow , wow"
Away ! away ! -- and away they all go"
`` I do n't understand you , comrade ,"
said the person_0.
`` That thing up yonder is to teach me to run ?"
He meant the moon.
`` You know nothing at all ,"
retorted the Yard Dog.
`` But then you 've only just been patched up.
What you see yonder is the moon , and the one that went before was the sun.
`` I do n't understand him ,"
said the person_0 ; `` but I have a feeling that he 's talking about something disagreeable.
I can feel that too"
`` Away ! away !"
The weather really changed.
A snowy radiance sprang from every twig.
It was wonderfully beautiful.
`` That is wonderfully beautiful ,"
said a young girl , who came with a young man into the garden.
They both stood still near the person_0 , and contemplated the glittering trees.
`` Summer can not show a more beautiful sight ,"
said she ; and her eyes sparkled.
`` And we ca n't have such a fellow as this in summer-time ,"
replied the young man , and he pointed to the person_0.
`` He is capital"
`` Who were those two ?"
the person_0 inquired of the Yard Dog.
`` You 've been longer in the yard than I.
Do you know them ?"
`` Of course I know them ,"
replied the Yard Dog.
`` She has stroked me , and he has thrown me a meat bone.
I do n't bite those two"
`` But what are they ?"
asked the person_0.
`` Lovers !"
replied the Yard Dog.
`` They will go to live in the same kennel , and gnaw at the same bone.
Away ! away !"
-LRB- Illustration : THE SNOW MAN AND THE YARD DOG.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Are they the same kind of beings as you and I ?"
asked the person_0.
`` Why , they belong to the master ,"
retorted the Yard Dog.
`` People certainly know very little who were only born yesterday.
I can see that in you.
I have age , and information.
Away ! away !"
`` The cold is charming ,"
said the person_0.
`` Tell me , tell me.
-- But you must not clank with your chain , for it jars within me when you do that"
`` Away ! away !"
barked the Yard Dog.
They used to kiss my nose , and wipe my paws with an embroidered handkerchief.
I was called ` Ami -- dear Ami -- sweet Ami.
So I came to live in the basement storey.
I received just as good food as ever , and even better.
I went under the stove , and could lie down quite beneath it.
Ah ! I still dream of that stove.
Away ! away !"
`` Does a stove look so beautiful ?"
asked the person_0.
`` Is it at all like me ?"
`` It 's just the reverse of you.
It 's as black as a crow , and has a long neck and a brazen drum.
It eats firewood , so that the fire spurts out of its mouth.
One must keep at its side , or under it , and there one is very comfortable.
You can see it through the window from where you stand"
`` And why did you leave her ?"
`` How could you quit such a comfortable place ?"
`` I was obliged ,"
replied the Yard Dog.
`` They turned me out of doors , and chained me up here.
` Bone for bone , ' I thought.
Away ! away ! that was the end of the affair"
But the person_0 was no longer listening to him.
`` What a strange crackling within me !"
he said.
I must go in there and lean against her , even if I have to break through the window"
`` You will never get in there ,"
said the Yard Dog ; `` and if you approach the stove you 'll melt away -- away !"
`` I am as good as gone ,"
replied the person_0.
`` I think I am breaking up"
The whole day the person_0 stood looking in through the window.
`` I can endure it no longer ,"
said he ; `` how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue !"
In the morning the window-panes of the basement lodging were covered with ice.
said the Yard Dog.
`` I have suffered from it myself , but I got over it.
Away ! away !"
he barked ; and he added , `` the weather is going to change"
And the weather did change ; it began to thaw.
The warmth increased , and the person_0 decreased.
He said nothing , and made no complaint -- and that 's an infallible sign.
One morning he broke down.
It was the pole round which the boys had built him up.
`` Ah ! now I can understand why he had such an intense longing ,"
said the Yard Dog.
`` Why , there 's a shovel for cleaning out the stove fastened to the pole.
The person_0 had a stove-rake in his body , and that 's what moved within him.
Now he has got over that too.
Away ! away !"
And soon they had got over the winter.
`` Away ! away !"
And nobody thought any more of the person_0"
There was mourning in the house , sorrow in every heart.
It was a heavy trial.
The father was bowed down , and the mother completely struck down by the great grief.
The tears of her husband fell upon her forehead , but she did not look at him.
The day of the funeral came.
It was necessary to do so"
`` When God is hard towards me , how should men be better ?"
she said , with sobs and groans.
The coffin was carried to the grave.
The disconsolate mother sat with her young daughters.
`` Thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child ,"
But she glanced keenly up , and saw his face under his hood.
`` Down to my child !"
she repeated ; and a despairing supplication spoke out of her words.
`` Darest thou follow me ?"
asked the form.
`` I am Death"
And she bowed her head in acquiescence.
It was twilight.
She uttered a cry , but it was inaudible.
`` My sweet darling mother ,"
she heard her child say.
`` It is not so beautiful on earth.
Do you see , mother -- do you see them all ? Oh , that is happiness !"
-LRB- Illustration : THE MOTHER AT THE GRAVE.
`` Oh , stay ! stay !"
entreated the mother.
And she kissed and fondled the child.
Then her name was called from above -- called in a plaintive voice.
What might this mean ? `` Hearest thou ?"
asked the child.
`` It is my father who calls thee"
And in a few moments deep sighs were heard , as of weeping children.
`` They are my sisters ,"
said the child.
`` Mother , you surely have not forgotten them ?"
And then she remembered those she had left behind.
A great terror came upon her.
She looked out into the night , and above her dim forms were flitting past.
She seemed to recognize a few more of these.
They floated through the Hall of Death towards the dark curtain , and there they vanished.
said the child.
`` Mother , now the sun is going to rise"
And an overpowering light streamed in upon her.
The child had vanished , and she was borne upwards.
And when she had spoken those words , it was as if her heart were lightened.
Everything was holy around her , and her heart was chastened.
THE key , which opes the chest of hoarded gold.
Unlocks the heart that favors would withhold.
As person_0 was a judge of high degree , No one so well embassador could be.
Long embassies and journeys far from home Oft cuckoldom around induce to roam.
` Gainst those declare at once ; nor lend an ear To flattery , their cunning sister-peer.
Bur , said the wife , my husband made me vow.
Revenge induced her ev ` ry thing to tell , Though she were implicated with the belle.
person_0 My lord !.
THUS metamorphosed to a pretty boy , The judge proceeded in the black 's employ.
Within a corner hidden , Argia lay , And heard what person_0 had been led to say.
AT length , as person_0 through a passage came , He suddenly beheld his beauteous dame.
OUR couple mutual compensation made , Then bade adieu to hill , and dale , and glade.
Why put such questions ? -- strict is not my pen.
I made myself perfect in polite learning , in the works of poets , and in versification.
I applied myself to geography , chronology , and to speak our Arabic tongue in its purity.
' Having spoken thus , they surrounded and fell upon us.
I will take care to supply you with a rope and a hatchet.
We ate together , and passed the remaining part of the day with much satisfaction.
' The genie made no other answer but reproaches and blows of which I heard the noise.
My landlord , the tailor , was very much rejoiced to see me.
I retired to my chamber , where I reproached myself a thousand times for my excessive imprudence.
' While I was thus giving myself over to melancholy thoughts , the tailor came in.
' At this discourse I changed color , and began to tremble.
Upon this I stepped back , and threw the scimitar on the ground.
Take your choice of any of these ; I will leave it to yourself.
' These words gave me some hope to mollify him.
I launched out in this posture , and advanced near the ship.
I threw myself at his feet , and took him by the coat in a begging posture.
` Let him alone , ' said he ; ` suffer him to write.
When I had done , the officers took the roll , and carried it to the sultan.
' At this command the officers could not forbear laughing.
' ` What do you say ? ' said the sultan.
By this science I know all enchanted persons at first sight.
I know who they are , and by whom they have been enchanted.
' These words were hardly uttered when I became a man as I was before.
Every one was in deep mourning for seven days , and many ceremonies were performed.
This is all I have to say to you.
And so I became a hermit"
When he arrived at the age of fifteen he was very wise and prudent.
The day for the ceremony was appointed.
After which he took his place among the crowd of viziers and emirs below the throne.
It required no less than a whole year for this young king to carry out his plans.
One evening when they rose from table , they talked of various matters.
I need only mention to you the Princess Giauhara , daughter of the king of Samandal.
Let me but know the difficulties that are to be surmounted , and we will surmount them.
Next day person_0 Saleh took leave of Queen Gulnare and the king his nephew.
He remained a good while absorbed in thought , without speaking a word.
It was not our intention you should have known anything , and we thought you were asleep.
' These words of the person_0 of Persia greatly embarrassed person_0 Saleh.
He begged him to wait.
But these reasons were not sufficient to satisfy the person_0 of Persia.
The fault is committed ; I will therefore do all that I can to remedy it.
Speak , and tell me frankly wherein I can serve you.
No king or prince in the world can dispute her with him.
At length , however , he broke into outrageous language , unworthy of a great king.
' This said , he came forward , and approached the princess with profound reverence.
I am a princess , daughter of the person_0 of Samandal , and my name is Giauhara.
I had only time to save myself , and escaped hither from his violence.
' This declaration of person_0 Beder did not produce the effect he expected.
Let us return to person_0 Saleh.
The queen her mother made her consider the necessity of not yielding too much to her grief.
' Queen Gulnare yielded.
He employed all his art to catch him , and at length succeeded.
Although I am advanced in years , I never saw such a bird in my life.
The officer , going to the peasant , asked him how much he wanted for that bird.
Looking earnestly at it , he asked the officer if he had seen it eat.
The king , surprised at her proceeding , asked the reason of it.
The queen consented to it with great willingness.
The greater part of the people were instantly drowned.
Some few were saved by swimming , and others by getting on pieces of the wreck.
This made him think it was not without cause that so many animals had opposed his passage.
' ` Alas ! why ? ' replied king Beder , very much surprised and alarmed.
But she does not suffer them long to enjoy this happiness.
You told me all these animals opposed your landing and entering , the city.
' This account exceedingly afflicted the young person_0 of Persia.
He became as fond of him as if he had been his own son.
But person_0 Beder was little charmed.
It is only to render thy fall most terrible that thou art raised so high.
They discoursed of indifferent matters , till the queen was informed that dinner was upon the table.
' This said , she ordered him a horse richly caparisoned , and he departed.
But fear nothing.
I know the way to make the mischief she intends for you fall upon herself.
If you had stayed ever so little longer , I was preparing to come and fetch you.
I should think yours were the same , did I not know she was dead.
My son and I will certainly die with grief if you do not grant it.
The surprise of person_0 Beder , at the sight of this purse , was not small.
Immediately rose a genie of gigantic form and stature.
' Lightning immediately disappeared , and got in an instant to the palace of the magic queen.
She immediately embraced him with an excess of joy.
After her , he was likewise embraced by the king his uncle and his relations.
Do but tell me in what I can serve you.
There remains one more , which I desire you to think of.
You have no doubt heard that I have already given my heart to the Princess of Samandal.
I have seen her , and do not repent of the present I then made her.
The princess had remained where the person_0 of Persia had left her.
The officer soon perceived her , and brought her with her women.
The preference he has given you over all other Princesses obliges us both to express our gratitude.
They were all sons of kings or princes , or persons of high rank.
I did not expect such proposals to one so young as I am.
It requires time to determine on what your majesty requires of me.
' Prince Camaralzaman 's answer extremely afflicted his father.
' He stopped here , and went out without staying to hear what the sultan would answer.
He communicated this new cause of discontent to his prime minister.
As for person_0 , she belonged to that class whom the great Solomon compelled to acknowledge him.
He therefore broke silence first.
King Gaiour , in a word , has shown that he has spared no expense.
' ' `` Sir ,"
` At last there came an embassy from the most rich and potent king of all.
' ` Hold thy tongue , cursed sprite , ' replied person_0.
` I tell thee once more that that can never be.
At once there arose a great contest between the genie and the fairy about their respective beauty.
' This proposal of Caschcasch 's pleased equally both person_0 and Danhasch.
He raised his head and leaned on his elbow , the better to consider her.
He was going to awaken her at that instant , but suddenly refrained himself.
I will content myself with this ring , as a remembrance of her.
After this he fell into a more profound sleep than before through the enchantment of the genies.
From surprise she proceeded to admiration , and from admiration to a transport of joy.
She could not comprehend how this exchange could have been made.
Tired with her fruitless endeavors to awaken the prince , she soon fell asleep.
Another time believe me when I assert anything.
' Danhasch and Caschcasch did as they were commanded , and person_0 retired to her well.
I am glad I was aware of it.
' The prince drew the slave up , and pressed him to tell him.
Do this quickly , and bring me a speedy answer.
Prince Camaralzaman received the king his father in the tower with great respect.
The king at length spoke of the lady to the prince.
I am ready to receive her at your hands with the deepest gratitude.
I beseech you to rise.
You will think so yourself if you go and see her.
' Here the queen endeavored to calm the princess by soft words.
He was the finest and best made youth the sun ever saw.
I entreat you , do not refuse me.
The princess demanded what all these preparations were for.
Then his majesty demanded of him who he was , and whence he came.
She has suffered no less on your account than you have on hers.
Think then immediately of the recovery of your health.
' This discourse had a marvellous effect on the prince.
The joy was soon general in the capital and every corner of his dominions.
You see he scarcely ever leaves me.
This then is the means I have contrived to obtain your liberty.
' Next day Prince Camaralzarnan took his opportunity.
The prince demanded his reason for what he had done.
The officer , redoubling his pace , with much ado got up with him.
' He had just spoken these words as he was at the door.
' The officer immediately went to tell the King of China what had happened.
' Then he told the king how he did it.
' He then told him his history.
I HAVE made many books about well-behaved people.
Tod.
Nobody could call person_1.
Tod `` nice"
The rabbits could not bear him ; they could smell him half a mile off.
Benjamin Bouncer.
He had half a dozen houses , but he was seldom at home.
The houses were not always empty when person_1.
Tod moved OUT ; because sometimes Tommy person_0 moved IN ; -LRB- without asking leave -RRB-.
He was not nice in his habits.
And the bed which he went to bed in , was generally person_1.
Tod 's.
He was friendly with old person_1.
Bouncer ; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and person_1.
Tod ; they often talked over that painful subject.
Old person_1.
Bouncer was stricken in years.
He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy , who had a young family.
Old person_1.
Bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon , because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.
The little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick.
To tell the truth -- old person_1.
Bouncer had forgotten them.
He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants ' eggs , and accused person_1.
Tod of poaching them.
I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail !"
said Tommy person_0.
It was not much of a joke , but it tickled old person_1.
Bouncer ; because Tommy person_0 was so fat and stumpy and grinning.
So old person_1.
Tommy person_0 squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.
Then old person_1.
Old person_1.
Bouncer coughed and laughed ; and Tommy person_0 puffed and grinned.
And person_1.
Bouncer laughed and coughed , and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke.
.
When Flopsy and Benjamin came back -- old person_1.
Bouncer woke up.
Tommy person_0 and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared ! person_1.
Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole.
But the smell of badger was undeniable ; and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand.
He was in disgrace ; Flopsy wrung her ears , and slapped him.
Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy person_0.
Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel.
A little stream crossed the way.
Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot ; the badger 's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.
Tod 's stick house was before him and , for once , person_1.
Tod was at home.
Benjamin Bunny sat up , staring ; his whiskers twitched.
Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate , and said something.
Benjamin stamped his foot , and bolted.
He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood.
Apparently Tommy person_0 had turned the same way.
Benjamin climbed over the wall , into a meadow.
He found another mole trap newly set ; he was still upon the track of Tommy person_0.
It was getting late in the afternoon.
Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air.
One of them in a blue coat by himself , was busily hunting for dandelions.
-- `` Cousin Peter ! Peter Rabbit , Peter Rabbit !"
shouted Benjamin Bunny.
`` Tommy person_0 ? how many , Cousin Benjamin ?"
`` Yes , yes ; not ten minutes since.
he said they were caterpillars ; I did think they were kicking rather hard , for caterpillars"
`` Which way ? which way has he gone , Cousin Peter ?"
Let me use my mind , Cousin Benjamin ; tell me from the beginning"
Benjamin did so.
`` My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years ;"
said Peter reflectively , `` but there are two hopeful circumstances.
Your family is alive and kicking ; and Tommy person_0 has had refreshment.
He will probably go to sleep , and keep them for breakfast"
`` Which way ?"
`` Cousin Benjamin , compose yourself.
I know very well which way.
Because person_1.
Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to person_1.
Tod 's other house , at the top of Bull Banks.
-LRB- Cottontail had married a black rabbit , and gone to live on the hill -RRB-.
Peter hid his dandelions , and accompanied the afflicted parent , who was all of a twitter.
He seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards , to rest.
`` He must be very puffed ; we are close behind him , by the scent.
What a nasty person !"
said Peter.
The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures.
Cottontail had seen Tommy person_0 passing in the distance.
He had nodded , and pointed to the sack , and seemed doubled up with laughing.
-- `` Come away , Peter ; he will be cooking them ; come quicker !"
said Benjamin Bunny.
`` They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbors.
Come on Cousin Benjamin !"
When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks , they went cautiously.
The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks ; and there , beneath a crag -- person_1.
Tod had made one of his homes.
It was at the top of a steep bank ; the rocks and bushes overhung it.
The rabbits crept up carefully , listening and peeping.
This house was something between a cave , a prison , and a tumble - down pig-stye.
There was a strong door , which was shut and locked.
Benjamin sighed with relief.
But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder.
No person was to be seen , and no young rabbits.
The kitchen was empty and silent ; the clock had run down.
Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window , and stared into the dusk.
Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house.
It was damp and smelly , and over - grown with thorns and briars.
The rabbits shivered in their shoes.
`` Oh my poor rabbit babies ! What a dreadful place ; I shall never see them again !"
sighed Benjamin.
They crept up to the bedroom window.
It was closed and bolted like the kitchen.
And as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness , they perceived that somebody was asleep on person_1.
Tod 's bed , curled up under the blanket.
-- `` He has gone to bed in his boots ,"
whispered Peter.
Benjamin , who was all of a twitter , pulled Peter off the window-sill.
Tommy person_0 's snores continued , grunty and regular from person_1.
Tod 's bed.
Nothing could be seen of the young family.
The sun had set ; an owl began to hoot in the wood.
It was a shocking place , and very dark.
They sat side by side outside the window , whispering and listening.
In half an hour the moon rose over the wood.
Tod 's bed.
But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery.
After much whispering , Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel.
They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank.
They dug and dug for hours.
Benjamin was on his back , scratching upwards.
Peter 's claws were worn down ; he was outside the tunnel , shuffling sand away.
Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill.
They did the most foolish thing that they could have done.
Tod 's kitchen floor.
person_1.
Tod was coming up Bull Banks , and he was in the very worst of tempers.
First he had been upset by breaking the plate.
Then the midges had been very bad.
person_1.
Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.
As usual , when out of humor , he determined to move house.
person_1.
Tod likes nobody 's leavings but his own.
No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as Tommy person_0.
person_1.
He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.
Once when it flew screaming over his head -- person_1.
Tod snapped at it , and barked.
He approached his house very carefully , with a large rusty key.
He sniffed and his whiskers bristled.
The house was locked up , but person_1.
Tod had his doubts whether it was empty.
He turned the rusty key in the lock ; the rabbits below could hear it.
person_1.
Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.
The sight that met person_1.
Tod 's eyes in person_1.
Tod 's kitchen made person_1.
Tod furious.
There was person_1.
Tod 's chair , and person_1.
But what absorbed person_1.
He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door.
Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry.
His whiskers bristled and his coat-collar stood on end with rage.
For the next twenty minutes person_1.
Tod kept creeping cautiously into the house , and retreating hurriedly out again.
By degrees he ventured further in -- right into the bedroom.
When he was outside the house , he scratched up the earth with fury.
But when he was inside -- he did not like the look of Tommy person_0 's teeth.
He was lying on his back with his mouth open , grinning from ear to ear.
He snored peacefully and regularly ; but one eye was not perfectly shut.
person_1.
Tod came in and out of the bedroom.
Twice he brought in his walking-stick , and once he brought in the coal-scuttle.
But he thought better of it , and took them away.
He was an incurably indolent person ; he was not in the least afraid of person_1.
Tod ; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.
person_1.
Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line.
He stood a minute watching Tommy person_0 and listening attentively to the snores.
They were very loud indeed , but seemed quite natural.
person_1.
Tod turned his back towards the bed , and undid the window.
It creaked ; he turned round with a jump.
Tommy person_0 , who had opened one eye -- shut it hastily.
The snores continued.
person_1.
The rest of the line , with a hook at the end , remained in his hand.
Tommy person_0 snored conscientiously.
person_1.
Tod stood and looked at him for a minute ; then he left the room again.
Tommy person_0 opened both eyes , and looked at the rope and grinned.
There was a noise outside the window.
Tommy person_0 shut his eyes in a hurry.
person_1.
Tod had gone out at the front door , and round to the back of the house.
On the way , he stumbled over the rabbit burrow.
Tommy person_0 watched him with one eye , through the window.
He was puzzled.
person_1.
Tommy person_0 snored industriously , with rather a snort.
person_1.
The snores were almost apoplectic ; but the grin was not quite so big.
person_1.
Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead.
His legs were dangerously near to Tommy person_0 's teeth.
-LRB- person_1.
Tod 's curtains were folded up , and put away , owing to the house being unoccupied.
So was the counterpane.
Tommy person_0 was covered with a blanket only.
-RRB- person_1.
person_1.
He very nearly overbalanced himself.
The snores became more and more apoplectic.
person_1.
Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident.
After considerable thought , he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug.
Surely there never was such a sleeper ! person_1.
Tod got up and down , down and up on the chair.
The pail got fuller and fuller , and swung like a pendulum.
At last person_1.
Tod 's preparations were complete.
said person_1.
Tod.
person_1.
Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room.
He went out of the house , shutting the front door.
The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.
said person_1.
Tod.
The moment he had gone , Tommy person_0 got up in a hurry ; he rolled person_1.
When person_1.
He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth.
He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes.
But no screams.
person_1.
Tod was mystified ; he sat quite still , and listened attentively.
Then he peeped in at the window.
The water was dripping from the bed , the pail had rolled into a corner.
Its head was covered by the wet blanket and it was NOT SNORING ANY LONGER.
person_1.
Tod watched it for half an hour ; his eyes glistened.
I will bring my bedding out , and dry it in the sun ,"
said person_1.
Tod.
`` I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach.
I must have a disinfecting.
Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur"
He opened the door.
Tommy person_0 was sitting at person_1.
Tod 's kitchen table , pouring out tea from person_1.
Tod 's tea-pot into person_1.
Tod 's tea-cup.
Tod.
Then person_1.
Tod rushed upon Tommy person_0 , and Tommy person_0 grappled with person_1.
Tod amongst the broken crockery , and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen.
Inside the house the racket was fearful.
Everything was upset except the kitchen table.
And everything was broken , except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender.
The crockery was smashed to atoms.
Tod 's sandy whiskers.
Tommy person_0 put his foot in a jar of raspberry Jam.
And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of person_1.
Tod.
Tod over and over like a log , out at the door.
There will never be any love lost between Tommy person_0 and person_1.
Tod.
But Benjamin was frightened -- `` Oh ; oh ! they are coming back !"
`` No they are not"
`` Yes they are !"
`` What dreadful bad language ! I think they have fallen down the stone quarry"
Still Benjamin hesitated , and Peter kept pushing him -- `` Be quick , it 's all right.
Shut the oven door , Cousin Benjamin , so that he wo n't miss them"
Decidedly there were lively doings in person_1.
Tod 's kitchen ! At home in the rabbit hole , things had not been quite comfortable.
After quarrelling at supper , Flopsy and old person_1.
Bouncer had passed a sleepless night , and quarrelled again at breakfast.
Old person_1.
The day passed heavily.
Old person_1.
Bouncer , very sulky , was huddled up in a corner , barricaded with a chair.
Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco.
She had been having a complete turn out and spring - cleaning , to relieve her feelings.
She had just finished.
Old person_1.
Bouncer , behind his chair , was wondering anxiously what she would do next.
In person_1.
He opened the oven door , felt inside , and found something warm and wriggling.
He lifted it out carefully , and rejoined Peter Rabbit.
`` I 've got them ! Can we get away ? Shall we hide , Cousin Peter ?"
Peter pricked his ears ; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.
They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit hole.
Great was old person_1.
They soon recovered.
A long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to person_1.
Bouncer.
He was rather upon his dignity ; but he accepted.
Old person_1.
Bouncer was forgiven , and they all had dinner.
Tod.
The End"
They were situated in a barren country , about four leagues distant from whence he set out.
He walked down with his arrow in his hand.
Raising her voice , she said , ` Come near , Prince person_0 ; you are welcome.
It is in your power to avail yourself of this favourable opportunity.
Night draws near , and it will be time for supper.
' She appointed twenty horsemen , well mounted and equipped , to attend him.
I readily consent.
Go immediately out on the road , find out where he retires , and bring me word.
I commend her to your care , and am persuaded that you will not abandon her.
Go and pursue your journey.
' This discourse of the fairy 's did not in the least alarm Prince person_0.
You will find the effect of it in less than an hour 's time.
When she had lain down again , the two women covered her up.
The melancholy you observe proceeds from another cause than the want of success.
And this is the cause of the melancholy which you perceived.
He ordered her to follow him to them.
' This advice all the other favorites unanimously applauded.
But they are all genies.
I know not what reason you had thus to treat a father.
I therefore will make a trial this day.
Though it may be a difficult thing , she will not refuse you.
All the world knows that fairies are capable of doing the most extraordinary things.
I have married the fairy you speak of.
I love her , and am persuaded she loves me.
But I can say nothing as to the influence your majesty believes I have over her.
Go , only ask her.
' Prince person_0 could not long withstand the fairy.
The sultan has imposed upon me the disagreeable task of worrying you.
How he has been informed of it I can not tell.
' Here the fairy Pari Banou interrupted Prince person_0 , and said , ` But I know.
Once more remember it is not I , but the sultan my father who asks this favor.
Pari Banou burst out laughing.
He took the tent and admired its smallness.
Do me this service , and complete the duty of a good son towards a tender father.
For this reason I dare not promise to bring the water.
I leave you to your own discretion to gratify or reject this new desire.
It shall be as you please.
But let not that frighten you.
I will give you means to pass by them without any danger.
When it stops , as the gates will be open , you will see the four lions.
The two that are awake will , by their roaring , wake the other two.
Fill your bottle without alighting , and then return with the same speed.
The lions will be so busy eating that they will let you pass.
He therefore put his sword again into its scabbard.
It is enough for me that he is your husband.
' ` He need but lead the way ; I will follow him , ' replied Schaibar.
Here likewise the officers , at the approach of Schaibar , abandoned their posts.
I will tell you something.
Then they sailed over a high mountain , and there they were miserably drowned.
In that country the flies are as big as the goats are here.
Open the window , that the lies may fly out"
`` I looked down upon Tyrol ,"
I looked at the pictures of St.
St.
And the horn sounded faint and more faintly , and the convent bell drowned its expiring echoes"
I looked upon a prison.
A closed carriage stood before it ; a prisoner was to be carried away.
His wife was a noble , good , and beautiful woman called Princess Murasaki -LRB- Violet -RRB-.
And their prayer was answered.
Do your best not to give trouble to your nurse or any other of your family.
Perhaps your father will marry again and some one will fill my place as your mother.
Do n't forget this.
I die with the hope that you will grow up a model woman"
The little Princess was very diligent , and her favorite studies were music and poetry.
It was the Festival of the Cherry Flowers , and there were great festivities at the Court.
On this momentous occasion she played well.
So one day she secretly ordered some poison and poisoned some sweet wine.
This poisoned wine she put into a bottle.
Into another similar bottle she poured some good wine.
`` You are both so good and happy"
And she filled two cups from the different bottles.
Suddenly the little boy screamed and threw himself on the floor , doubled up with pain.
But this was of no avail.
At last the day came and her poem was finished.
It was written on a leaflet of paper heavily flecked with gold-dust.
Strange indeed it seemed to all those standing round.
The waters ceased their roaring , and the river was quiet in direct answer to her prayer.
After this the Emperor soon recovered his health.
There was only one person who was not pleased at person_1-person_0 's success.
That one was her stepmother.
Her envy and jealousy burned in her heart like fire.
Many were the lies she carried to her husband about person_1-person_0 , but all to no purpose.
He would listen to none of her tales , telling her sharply that she was quite mistaken.
Katoda , her vassal , was bound to obey his mistress.
He was nearly ill with anxiety.
They were soon ready and mounted , waiting at the gate for their lord.
The cottage was wide open and she was sitting facing the view.
Listening attentively , he heard her reading the Buddhist scriptures with great devotion.
`` person_1-person_0 !"
he cried , `` it is you.
my person_1-person_0 !"
`` My father , my father ! It is indeed you -- oh , my father !"
The Prince 's astonishment and indignation knew no bounds.
He gave up the hunt at once and hurried home with his daughter.
This is said to have been the work of the hands of the good Princess person_1"
Long , long ago there lived a great Chinese person_1 who succeeded her brother the Emperor Fuki.
She was a wonderful woman , and an able ruler.
The rebel 's name was person_0.
He was twenty-six feet high.
His body was entirely covered with hair , and his face was as black as iron.
He was a wizard and a very terrible character indeed.
person_0 was so angry at being thwarted in his desire that he raised a revolt.
Do you dare to stop me ?"
`` Yes ,"
answered Eiko.
`` I ought to lead the army.
It is you who should follow me"
At this bold reply Hako 's anger burst from a spark into a flame.
`` Dare you answer me thus ? Take that ,"
and he lunged at him with his lance.
The action was so quick that Hako stood dazed , not knowing what to do.
One hundred thousand soldiers followed them and marched to put down the rebel person_0.
Within a short time the two Generals reached the castle where person_0 had fortified himself.
-LRB- He little thought how hard he would find the fight.
and they attacked him from the right and from the left with sword and with lance.
The wizard saw that both his enemies remained unscathed.
They cried to him to help them.
The old man nodded his head and came down to the edge of the water.
So they presented themselves before the person_1 Jokwa.
Now Shikuyu , the Fire King , lived at the South Pole.
To look at he was a giant , and stood thirty feet high.
`` Surely ,"
thought the person_1 , `` Shikuyu can conquer person_0"
Eiko was surprised at learning this.
Shikuyu did as he was asked , and returned with Eiko to the person_1.
His reply was very reassuring : `` Do not have any anxiety.
I will certainly kill person_0"
Then he repeated an incantation , and the water-floods rose and welled as high as mountains.
Eiko rode to meet him , and the two fought together for some time.
They were well matched in a hand-to-hand combat.
I will not hurt such a good man"
And he pretended to retreat , turning away the head of his horse.
Saying this , the Fire King made a sign to the unwary Hako to attack him.
He now broke from the fray and tried to escape in earnest.
Shikuyu now turned and bade Jokwa 's soldiers charge the enemy 's forces.
The wizard found that the battle was against him.
She showered all manner of gifts and honors upon Shikuyu.
But all this time fire was bursting from the mountain broken by the fall of person_0.
Having ascertained this , she set to work at repairs.
Now all was ready.
Neither the sun shone by day nor the moon by night.
But Jokwa had recourse to magic.
`` You need have no anxiety about the broken pillar ,"
said the two ambassadors.
Then the Sun and Moon appeared satisfied , and they both set out to try the roads.
They found that what the person_1 's deputies had told them was correct.
`` Yes , it 's all very well for you to sing ,"
But after all it is well that there should be somebody at least who is merry.
I 've no reason to sing , and , moreover , I ca n't sing.
I have gone through a great deal , when I come to recollect.
And now the Bottle-neck told its story , which was sufficiently remarkable.
All the bottles were packed up , and our bottle was among them.
A ticket was placed on it , marked `` first quality ;"
`` Ah , how beautiful is life !"
The bottle-neck looked out from the folds of the white napkin.
It also looked at the young sailor who sat next to the girl.
He was a friend of old days , the son of the portrait painter.
The young people sauntered through the green wood , and talked to one another.
The father took the full bottle and the corkscrew in his hand.
`` Health to the betrothed pair !"
`` Happiness and blessing !"
`` Safe return , and a wedding this day next year !"
And so saying he hurled it high into the air.
`` I gave them wine , and they gave me marsh-water ,"
he said ; `` but it was all meant for the best"
-LRB- Illustration : THE BOTTLE IS PRESENT ON A JOYOUS OCCASION.
Accordingly , whenever Peter Jensen brought it out , it was dubbed by his messmates The Apothecary.
It was black night.
The ship sank , and the crew sank with her.
Beyond this it was its own master , but one may grow tired even of that.
The bottle was fished out and examined on all sides.
`` If I had been down in the room ,"
thought the Bottle , `` I might have learned it"
It was now washed and rinsed , and indeed this was requisite.
The bottle was filled with seeds , though it scarcely knew what they were.
It was corked , and well wrapped up.
`` What trouble they have taken over yonder with that bottle !"
it heard people say ; `` and yet it is most likely broken"
But it was not broken.
Out in the garden there was a great festival.
Flaming lamps hung like garlands , and paper lanterns shone transparent , like great tulips.
or the `` down ;"
`` This is a wonderful passage , up into the air !"
Steeples and roofs lay far , far beneath , and the people looked like mites.
`` That would do capitally for a bird-glass ,"
`` Yes , it 's very well for you to sing ,"
`` No , you certainly must not spend a dollar for your daughter 's bridal wreath ,"
said the old maid.
`` You shall have a beautiful little nosegay from me , full of blossoms.
There were tears in the eyes of the old maid.
ONCE upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes.
Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.
The eight little pigs had very fine appetites.
`` Yus , yus , yus ! they eat and indeed they DO eat !"
said Aunt Pettitoes , looking at her family with pride.
Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.
And presently in a basket of clean clothes , we found another dirty little pig.
`` Tchut , tut , tut ! whichever is this ?"
grunted Aunt Pettitoes.
I went into the garden ; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots.
I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.
Cross-patch tried to bite me.
Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and person_1"
`` Yus , yus !"
sighed Aunt Pettitoes.
Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether"
`` Yus , yus , yus ,"
said Aunt Pettitoes , `` there will be more to eat without them"
And the other two little boy pigs , person_1 and Alexander , went to market.
Take your brother Alexander by the hand.
Mind your Sunday clothes , and remember to blow your nose"
Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other -- `` Now son Alexander take the hand"
-- `` Wee , wee , wee !"
giggled Alexander -- `` take the hand of your brother person_1 , you must go to market.
Mind --"
`` Wee , wee , wee !"
interrupted Alexander again.
`` You put me out ,"
said Aunt Pettitoes.
`` Observe sign-posts and milestones ; do not gobble herring bones --"
`` And remember ,"
said I impressively , `` if you once cross the county boundary you can not come back.
Alexander , you are not attending.
Here are two licences permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire.
Attend , Alexander.
I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman"
person_1 listened gravely ; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.
Then they started.
person_1 and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile ; at least person_1 did.
Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side.
person_1 and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles.
Alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time ; he had already eaten all his own peppermints.
`` Give me one of yours , please , person_1"
`` But I wish to preserve them for emergencies ,"
said person_1 doubtfully.
Alexander went into squeals of laughter.
person_1 reproved Alexander.
`` What 's that , young sirs ? Stole a pig ? Where are your licences ?"
said the policeman.
They had nearly run against him round a corner.
conversation sweeties at three farthings"
-- `` What 's this ? This ai n't a licence"
Alexander 's nose lengthened visibly , he had lost it.
`` I had one , indeed I had , Mr.
Policeman !"
`` It 's not likely they let you start without.
I am passing the farm.
You may walk with me"
`` Can I come back too ?"
inquired person_1.
`` I see no reason , young sir ; your paper is all right"
person_1 did not like going on alone , and it was beginning to rain.
I disposed of Alexander in the neighborhood ; he did fairly well when he had settled down.
`` Over the Hills , 4 miles ,"
`` To Pettitoes Farm , 3 miles"
said person_1.
He took a wrong turn -- several wrong turns , and was quite lost.
It grew dark , the wind whistled , the trees creaked and groaned.
said person_1 , wet and cold and quite tired out.
`` Bacon and eggs , bacon and eggs !"
clucked a hen on a perch.
`` Trap , trap , trap ! cackle , cackle , cackle !"
scolded the disturbed cockerel.
`` To market , to market ! jiggetty jig !"
clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him.
person_1 , much alarmed , determined to leave at daybreak.
In the meantime , he and the hens fell asleep.
In less than an hour they were all awakened.
The owner , Mr.
He made a singular remark -- `` Hallo , here 's another !"
-- seized person_1 by the scruff of the neck , and dropped him into the hamper.
`` This one 's come of himself , whatever ,"
said Mr.
Piperson , turning person_1 's pockets inside out.
Mr.
There was a smothered noise -- `` Shut up !"
said Mr.
Piperson.
person_1 warmed his hands , and eyed him.
Mr.
said Mr.
Piperson.
person_1 sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.
Mr.
Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge.
Mr.
person_1 ate his supper discreetly.
After supper Mr.
Besides , the hens had seen this pig.
He looked at the small remains of a flitch , and then looked undecidedly at person_1.
`` You may sleep on the rug ,"
said Mr.
Peter Thomas Piperson.
person_1 slept like a top.
In the morning Mr.
Piperson made more porridge ; the weather was warmer.
said he to person_1.
Before person_1 could reply , a neighbor , who was giving Mr.
Piperson and the hens a lift , whistled from the gate.
Mr.
said Mr.
Piperson.
But he distrusted Peter Thomas.
He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen.
person_1 ate the peel , and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket.
` Over the hills and far away ! '"
person_1 put down a plate which he was wiping , and listened.
There was nobody there.
It was quite quiet.
After another long pause , person_1 pushed a peppermint under the door.
It was sucked in immediately.
In the course of the day person_1 pushed in all the remaining six peppermints.
When Mr.
Mr.
He did lock the cupboard door ; but without properly shutting it.
person_1 sat by the fire , eating his supper.
Make me more porridge , please !"
person_1 jumped , and looked round.
A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.
`` How did you come here ?"
asked person_1.
`` Stolen ,"
replied person_0-wig , with her mouth full.
person_1 helped himself to meal without scruple.
`` What for ?"
`` Bacon , hams ,"
replied person_0-wig cheerfully.
`` Why on earth do n't you run away ?"
exclaimed the horrified person_1.
`` I shall after supper ,"
said person_0 - wig decidedly.
person_1 made more porridge and watched her shyly.
`` You ca n't go in the dark ,"
said person_1.
person_0-wig looked anxious.
`` Do you know your way by daylight ?"
`` I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river.
Which way are YOU going , Mr.
person_0 ?"
`` To market -- I have two pig papers.
I might take you to the bridge ; if you have no objection ,"
said person_1 much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool.
He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep.
She became quiet , and there was a smell of peppermint.
`` I thought you had eaten them ,"
said person_1 , waking suddenly.
`` Only the corners ,"
replied person_0 - wig , studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight.
`` I wish you would n't ; he might smell them through the ceiling ,"
said the alarmed person_1.
person_0-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket ; `` Sing something ,"
she demanded.
`` I am sorry.
I have tooth - ache ,"
said person_1 much dismayed.
`` Then I will sing ,"
replied person_0-wig.
`` You will not mind if I say iddy tidditty ? I have forgotten some of the words"
person_1 made no objection ; he sat with his eyes half shut , and watched her.
person_1 , on tip-toe , covered her up with an antimacassar.
Piperson overhead.
She was excited and half - frightened.
`` But it 's dark ! How can we find our way ?"
Piperson"
person_0-wig sat down again , and commenced to cry.
`` Come away person_0-wig ; we can see when we get used to it.
Come ! I can hear them clucking !"
He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them.
There was no garden ; the neighborhood of Mr.
Piperson 's was all scratched up by fowls.
They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.
`` That 's Westmorland ,"
said person_0-wig.
`` Come , person_0-wig , we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring"
`` Why do you want to go to market , person_1 ?"
inquired person_0-wig presently.
`` I do n't want ; I want to grow potatoes"
`` Have a peppermint ?"
said person_0-wig.
person_1 refused quite crossly.
`` Does your poor toothy hurt ?"
inquired person_0-wig.
person_1 grunted.
person_0-wig ate the peppermint herself and followed the opposite side of the road.
`` person_0-wig ! keep under the wall , there 's a man ploughing"
person_0-wig crossed over , they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.
Suddenly person_1 stopped ; he heard wheels.
Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman 's cart.
The reins flapped on the horse 's back , the grocer was reading a newspaper.
`` Take that peppermint out of your mouth , person_0-wig , we may have to run.
Do n't say one word.
Leave it to me.
And in sight of the bridge !"
said poor person_1 , nearly crying.
He began to walk frightfully lame , holding person_0-wig 's arm.
He pulled the cart crossways , and held down his whip.
`` Hallo ! Where are YOU going to ?"
-- person_1 stared at him vacantly.
`` Are you deaf ? Are you going to market ?"
person_1 nodded slowly.
`` I thought as much.
It was yesterday.
Show me your licence ?"
person_1 stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer 's horse which had picked up a stone.
The grocer flicked his whip -- `` Papers ? person_0 licence ?"
person_1 fumbled in all his pockets , and handed up the papers.
The grocer read them , but still seemed dissatisfied.
`` This here pig is a young lady ; is her name Alexander ?"
person_0-wig opened her mouth and shut it again ; person_1 coughed asthmatically.
reward"
He looked suspiciously at person_0-wig.
Then he stood up in the trap , and whistled for the ploughman.
`` You wait here while I drive on and speak to him ,"
said the grocer , gathering up the reins.
The grocer did so ; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road.
`` Now , person_0-wig , NOW !"
said person_1.
Then said the merchant , `` If thou couldst help me I would willingly tell thee"
`` Who knows ?"
replied the black dwarf.
`` Perhaps , I can help thee"
`` Do not trouble thyself ,"
said the dwarf.
The merchant thought , `` What can that be but my dog ?"
In the meantime the boy grew tall , and at the same time sharp and clever.
One day his son asked what ailed him , but the father would not say.
The black man has no power over me"
He was silent , but the son asked , `` What dost thou want here ?"
Then said the black dwarf , `` I have to speak with thy father , and not with thee"
The son replied , `` Thou hast betrayed and misled my father , give back the writing"
`` No ,"
said the black dwarf , `` I will not give up my rights"
But when he entered it , he found that it was bewitched.
`` How can I do that ?"
he inquired.
Then said he , `` I will gladly set thee free"
After this their marriage was celebrated , and he was King of the Golden Mountain.
They lived very happily together , and the Queen bore a fine boy.
but he suffered her to have no rest until she consented.
Then the shepherd said to his parents , `` I am verily your son.
Do you know of no mark on my body by which you could recognize me ?"
`` Yes ,"
said his mother , `` our son had a raspberry mark under his right arm"
He said , `` I have done it thoughtlessly , and not with evil intention ,"
And he laid his head on her lap , and fell asleep.
`` Home to thy parents thou canst not return ,"
`` Oh , no ,"
said he , `` I will not do that"
So they gave him the boots as well.
So he put on his cloak , and unseen by all went into the palace.
He placed himself behind her , and no one saw him.
She said , `` Has the devil power over me , or did my deliverer never come ?"
Have I deserved this from thee ?"
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them.
King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.
From that time she began repeating , `` person_0 , person_0 ; I want person_0 ,"
and would say nothing else.
Her father used to get quite vexed with her.
`` Who is this person_0 ? who ever heard of this person_0 ?"
he would say.
`` He is the man I am to marry ,"
said person_1.
`` Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but person_0"
And she was half mad.
All the time she kept saying , `` person_0 , person_0 ; I want person_0"
The prince heard her , and turned round.
`` Who is calling me ?"
he asked.
`` Very well , you shall have him for your husband ,"
said Munsuk Raja.
`` We will ask him to-morrow"
person_1 consented to wait , although she was very impatient.
All the time she kept saying , `` person_0 , person_0 ; I want person_0 ;"
and so she wandered about for twelve years.
`` I think you will never get there ,"
But person_1 said she did not care ; she must see Prince person_0.
`` Well ,"
She went on and on , and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river.
There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish.
All the time she kept saying , `` person_0 , person_0"
At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he could.
`` Oh , Mr.
Crow ,"
said the poor fish `` do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise"
`` Very well ,"
said the crow , `` open your mouth wide , and I 'll fly down and see"
`` You have a Rakshas in your stomach ,"
said the crow , and he flew away.
There he stopped.
And a jackal came down to the river to drink.
`` Oh , jackal ,"
said the Rohu `` do tell me what I have inside me"
`` How can I tell ?"
said the jackal.
`` I can not see unless I go inside you"
So off he ran.
After the jackal came an enormous snake.
`` Oh ,"
'"
`` If you do that , I shall die ,"
said the Rohu.
`` Oh , no ,"
She was now very old.
There some men heard her crying , `` person_0 , person_0 ; I want person_0 ,"
and they asked her what she wanted.
`` I want King person_0 ,"
she said.
So they went in and said to Prince person_0 , `` An old woman outside says she wants you"
`` I can not leave this place ,"
said he ; `` send her in here"
They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted.
`` I want to marry you ,"
she answered.
Then I went mad , and I have wandered about all these years looking for you"
Prince person_0 said , `` Very good"
`` Pray to Khuda ,"
said person_1 , `` to make us both young again , and then we shall be married"
When he touched person_1 's clothes they caught fire , and she and he became young again.
One day Prince person_0 said to person_1 , `` Let us go through this jungle"
`` No , no ,"
said person_1 ; `` if we go through this jungle , some harm will happen to me"
But Prince person_0 laughed , and went into the jungle.
Would he be very sorry if she died ? And would he marry another wife ? I will see"
King Dantal wished his son to marry again.
`` I will only have person_1 for my wife ; I will not marry any other woman ,"
said Prince person_0.
`` How can you marry person_1 ? person_1 is dead.
She will never come back to you ,"
said the father.
`` Then I 'll not have any wife at all ,"
said Prince person_0.
`` Well ,"
So the angel came to person_1 again as a fakir and carried her to King Dantal 's garden.
`` Now ,"
He then told her what she must do as a little dog to regain her human form.
`` Oh , look , look !"
`` It is a Rakshas , a Rakshas !"
`` What nonsense ,"
said his father.
However , Prince person_0 would not walk in the garden any more.
and he was in great terror.
`` An old woman ! an old woman ! always an old woman !"
said his father.
`` You do nothing but think of old women.
How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened ?"
How can I marry such an old woman as you are ?"
I have loved you all these long , long years.
`` Well ,"
said person_0 , `` if you can make yourself a young girl again , I will marry you"
person_1 said , `` Oh , that is quite easy.
Khuda will make me a young girl again.
In the morning person_1 took her little dog 's form , and disappeared in the garden.
`` Oh !"
said the Prince , `` I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit"
`` No ,"
At the sight of her extreme beauty , person_0 fell backwards fainting on the floor.
King Dantal answered , `` It is because you are so beautiful.
You are far , far more beautiful than you ever were.
But he will be very happy directly"
Then person_1 said , `` Why did you faint ? Did you not see I am person_1 ?"
`` Oh !"
They rode on the same horse , and had only a groom with them.
They came to another kingdom , to a beautiful garden.
`` We must go into that garden and see it ,"
said person_0.
`` No , no ,"
said person_1 ; `` it belongs to a bad Raja , Chumman Basa , a very wicked man"
`` What nonsense ,"
said person_0.
`` I believe he is a very good Raja.
Anyhow , I am so near to him that I could not get away"
`` Well ,"
`` Because I want to take you ,"
he answered.
`` You can not ,"
said person_1.
`` Yes , I can ,"
said the Raja.
`` Take me , then ,"
Then he got up and saw the Raja 's dead body by person_1 's horse.
`` What 's that ?"
said person_0.
`` That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me , just as I said he would"
`` Who killed him ?"
asked person_0.
`` I did ,"
answered person_1 , `` and it was I who brought you to life"
`` Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so ,"
said person_0.
`` No ,"
said person_1 , `` for he is a wicked man , and will try to do you harm"
`` What will you do ,"
said person_0 , `` if I leave you ? I can not leave you"
`` I will take care of myself ,"
There Prince person_0 told everything to his father , who was horrified and angry.
`` How lucky for you that you have such a wife ,"
he said.
And he made so much of person_1.
He loved her dearly ; he could not do enough for her.
There was once upon a time a tailor who had three sons , and only one goat.
The sons , therefore , did this , in turn.
`` Come home , then ,"
`` Well ,"
said the old tailor , `` has the goat had as much food as she ought ?"
`` Oh ,"
answered the son , `` she has eaten so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch"
`` What do I hear ?"
and in his anger he took the yard-measure from the wall , and drove him out with blows.
At night when he wanted to go home , he asked , `` Goat , art thou satisfied ?"
`` Come home , then ,"
said the youth , and led her home , and tied her up in the stable.
`` Well ,"
said the old tailor , `` has the goat had as much food as she ought ?"
`` Oh ,"
answered the son , `` she has eaten so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch"
`` The godless wretch !"
cried the tailor , `` to let such a good animal hunger ,"
and he ran up and drove the youth out of doors with the yard-measure.
`` Come home , then ,"
said the youth , and led her into the stable , and tied her up.
`` Well ,"
said the old tailor , `` has the goat had a proper amount of food ?"
`` She has eaten so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch"
`` Oh , the brood of liars !"
The old tailor was now alone with his goat.
`` There thou mayest for once eat to thy heart 's content ,"
said he to her , and let her browse till evening.
Then he asked , `` Goat , art thou satisfied ?"
`` Come home , then ,"
said the tailor , and led her into the stable , and tied her fast.
`` Wait , thou ungrateful creature ,"
The young journeyman thought , `` With this thou hast enough for thy whole life ,"
and then everything appeared that his heart desired.
`` No ,"
`` Fall to , dear friends ,"
At mid-day he reached his father , who received him with great joy.
`` Well , my dear son , what hast thou learned ?"
said he to him.
`` Father , I have become a joiner"
`` A good trade ,"
replied the old man ; `` but what hast thou brought back with thee from thy apprenticeship ?"
`` Father , the best thing which I have brought back with me is this little table"
`` But it is a table which furnishes itself ,"
replied the son.
The second son had gone to a miller and had apprenticed himself to him.
`` To what use is he put , then ?"
asked the young apprentice.
`` He lets gold drop from his mouth ,"
answered the miller.
`` That is a fine thing ,"
said the apprentice , and thanked the master , and went out into the world.
When he had need of gold , he had only to say `` Bricklebrit"
After dinner the guest asked what he owed.
He felt in his pocket , but his gold was just at an end.
`` Wait an instant , sir host ,"
said he , `` I will go and fetch some money ;"
but he took the table-cloth with him.
The stranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cried , `` Bricklebrit ,"
`` Eh , my word ,"
said the host , `` ducats are quickly coined there ! A purse like that is not amiss"
`` What hast thou made of thyself , my son ?"
asked the old man.
`` A miller ,"
dear father , he answered.
`` What hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels ?"
`` Nothing else but an ass"
`` There are asses enough here ,"
said the father , `` I would rather have had a good goat"
`` Yes ,"
Just summon all our relations hither , and I will make them rich folks"
`` That suits me well ,"
and ran out himself and called the relations together.
`` Now watch ,"
said he , and cried , `` Bricklebrit ,"
`` I can put on the sack ,"
`` I will tell thee why ,"
In the evening the young turner reached the inn where his brothers had been cheated.
`` Yes ,"
The inn-keeper pricked up his ears , `` What in the world can that be ?"
Instantly the little cudgel came forth , and fell on the inn-keeper and gave him a sound thrashing.
`` Oh , no ,"
So he cried , `` Into the sack , Cudgel !"
and let him have rest.
Next morning the turner went home to his father with the wishing-table , and the gold-ass.
`` Dear father ,"
said he , `` I have become a turner"
`` A skilled trade ,"
said the father.
`` What hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels ?"
`` A precious thing , dear father ,"
replied the son , `` a cudgel in the sack"
`` What !"
`` But not one like this , dear father.
Now let them both be sent for , and invite all our kinsmen.
The old tailor would not quite believe , but nevertheless got the relatives together.
The miller said , `` Bricklebrit ,"
-LRB- I can see in thy face that thou also wouldst like to be there.
And scarcely had the carpenter said , `` Table , cover thyself ,"
than it was spread and amply covered with the most exquisite dishes.
`` Ah ,"
answered Redskin , `` a fierce beast is in my cave and stared at me with its fiery eyes"
`` We will soon drive him out ,"
`` It is all very well for thee to talk ,"
-RRB-"
`` I want to be something !"
said the eldest of five brothers.
`` I want to do something in the world.
`` But that _ something _ will not be enough !"
quoth the second brother.
`` What you intend doing is just as much as nothing at all.
It is journeyman 's work , and can be done by a machine.
Yes , and if all goes well , I will keep journeymen.
`` That 's nothing at all !"
said the third.
I know something better than that.
I will be an architect , and will thus enter into the territory of art and speculation.
I shall be reckoned among those who stand high in point of intellect.
That will always be a thing to remember , and that 's what I call something !"
`` But I do n't care at all for _ that _ something ,"
said the fourth"
_ I _ wo n't sail in the wake of others , and be a copyist.
`` But supposing the climate and the material are bad ,"
Listen , it is a capital story.
You see that is what comes of bricks.
The poor woman put together the house for herself.
It was little and narrow , and the single window was quite crooked.
The door was too low , and the thatched roof might have shown better workmanship.
And he carried his idea into effect.
It was a pretty house , and in it lived a happy pair.
It was only one storey high , but still it was _ something _.
The people always said he had a good head of his own.
At last his hour came , and he died , and came to the gates of Paradise.
said the critic.
`` Pray who are you , my good woman ?"
he asked.
`` Do you want to get in here too ?"
And the old woman curtsied as well as she could : she thought it must be St.
Peter himself talking to her.
`` I 'm a poor old woman of a very humble family ,"
she replied.
`` I 'm old Margaret that lived in the house on the sea wall"
`` Well , and what have you done ? what have you accomplished down there ?"
It would be a real mercy to allow me to slip in through the gate"
`` In what manner did you leave the world ?"
`` Why , I really do n't know how I left it.
It was a hard winter , but I have got out of it all now.
The sea was covered with ice as far as one could look.
.
I knew it , and a shuddering came upon me.
But I managed to open the window.
I heard the boys shouting ` hurrah ! ' and the servant men and maids singing.
There were all kinds of merriment going on.
They could not hear me , and I could not come out to them.
I succeeded in lighting up a beacon for them.
Not one remained behind.
Then the gates of heaven were opened , and the angel led the old woman in.
`` Look , this is what the poor woman brought ,"
said the angel to the critic.
But thou canst not go back , and I can do nothing for thee !"
He wants it now ; and is not this the very fountain of mercy ?"
Thou shalt not be turned away.
`` I could have said that in better words !"
The son took the money and departed.
`` Please do not kill the dog ,"
pleaded the young and tender-hearted fellow ; `` I will give you one hundred rupees for it"
He next met with some people fighting about a cat.
Some of them wanted to kill it , but others not.
`` Oh ! please do not kill it ,"
said he ; `` I will give you one hundred rupees for it"
Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money.
Some of them wished to kill it , but others did not.
`` Please do not kill the snake ,"
said he ; `` I will give you one hundred rupees"
Of course the people agreed , and were highly delighted.
`` You fool ! You scamp !"
`` Go and live in the stables and repent of your folly.
You shall never again enter my house"
So the young man went and lived in the stables.
Would that you knew my father ! How glad he would be to see his son 's preserver !"
`` Where does he live ? I should like to see him , if possible ,"
said the young man.
`` Well said !"
continued the snake.
`` O master !"
exclaimed the cat and dog , when they saw what he was going to do.
`` What shall we do ? Where shall we go ?"
`` Wait for me here ,"
he replied.
`` I am not going far.
I shall not be long away"
On saying this , he dived into the water and was lost to sight.
`` Now what shall we do ?"
said the dog to the cat.
`` We must remain here ,"
replied the cat , `` as our master ordered.
Do not be anxious about food.
I will go to the people 's houses and get plenty of food for both of us"
His highness commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him.
He then returned.
He feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir.
At last he determined to seek the counsel of his aunt , who was an ogress.
She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing , and buzzing , and buzzing.
She also embraced and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words.
The beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived.
The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious thing.
`` Rise up.
Be glad.
Mourn no more ,"
she said to him.
`` The woman for whom you yearn will appear at your summons.
See , here is the charm , whereby you may bring her before you"
He sat down and determined to put an end to himself.
Presently the cat and dog came up.
They had gone away and hidden themselves , when they saw the house and everything disappear.
`` O master !"
they said , `` stay your hand.
Your trial is great , but it can be remedied.
Give us one month , and we will go and try to recover your wife and house"
`` Go ,"
said he , `` and may the great God aid your efforts.
Bring back my wife , and I shall live"
`` We may have some difficulty here ,"
said the cat.
`` Look , the king has taken our master 's wife and house for himself.
You stay here.
I will go to the house and try to see her"
`` But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people ?"
she asked.
`` Yes ,"
replied the cat , `` if you can tell me where the charmed ring is"
`` The ring is in the stomach of the ogress ,"
she said.
`` All right ,"
said the cat , `` I will recover it.
If we once get it , everything is ours"
The eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married.
`` Oh ! let me go , let me go ,"
cried the terrified rat.
`` Oh ! let him go ,"
squealed all the company.
`` It is his wedding day"
`` No , no ,"
replied the cat.
`` Not unless you do some thing for me.
Listen.
If you will procure it for me , I will allow the rat to depart unharmed.
If you do not , then your prince dies under my feet"
`` Very well , we agree ,"
said they all.
`` Nay , if we do not get the ring for you , devour us all"
This was rather a bold offer.
However , they accomplished the thing.
All seemed safe now.
`` How glad master will be !"
they thought , and ran as fast as their legs could carry them.
Now , on the way they had to cross a stream.
The dog swam , and the cat sat on its back.
Sorry moment , for the dog at once dropped it , and a fish swallowed it.
`` Oh ! what shall I do ? what shall I do ?"
said the dog.
`` What is done is done ,"
replied the cat.
I have a plan.
You go and kill a small lamb , and bring it here to me"
`` All right ,"
said the dog , and at once ran off.
He soon came back with a dead lamb , and gave it to the cat.
`` Come along now ; I have got the ring ,"
said the cat to the dog.
`` No , I will not ,"
said the dog , `` unless you let me have the ring.
I can carry it as well as you.
Let me have it or I will kill you"
So the cat was obliged to give up the ring.
The careless dog very soon dropped it again.
This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite.
`` See , see , there it goes -- away to that big tree ,"
the cat exclaimed.
`` Oh ! oh ! what have I done ?"
cried the dog.
`` You foolish thing , I knew it would be so ,"
said the cat.
`` Come along ,"
it said to the dog when it reached the ground.
`` We must make haste now.
We have been delayed.
Our master will die from grief and suspense.
Come on"
In a moment his sorrow was turned into joy.
After his return he visited one of the little provincial towns on the island of Seeland.
person_1 the sculptor was there.
She was very appreciative , and incredibly ignorant -- a kind of female Caspar Hauser.
`` I should like to see Rome ,"
she said.
`` It must be a lovely city , with all the strangers who are continually arriving there.
Now , do give us a description of Rome.
How does the city look when you come in by the gate ?"
`` I can not very well describe it ,"
replied the sculptor.
`` An organist !"
exclaimed the lady , who had never met with the word _ obelisk _.
`` Has the Pope a large family ?"
asked the lady.
`` That 's not what I mean ,"
the widow persisted.
`` I mean , has he a wife and children ?"
`` The Pope is not allowed to marry ,"
said the gentleman.
`` I do n't like that ,"
was the lady 's comment.
sighed a few of the guests.
`` Oh , to travel !"
sighed others.
`` Charming , charming !"
chorused they all.
`` Yes , if I win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery ,"
said the head tax-collector 's lady , `` then we will travel.
I and my daughter , and you , Mr.
person_1 ; you must be our guide.
We 'll all three travel together , and one or two good friends more"
And the daughter sighed very quietly.
The house of the head tax-collector 's widow was the one which Mr.
They called her person_0.
`` She has been always accustomed to that ,"
her mother said.
`` She 's a beauty , and they always are easily tired.
She sleeps rather late , but that makes her eyes so clear"
What a power lay in the depths of these dark blue eyes ! `` Still waters run deep"
The young man felt the truth of this proverb ; and his heart had sunk into the depths.
It was a pleasure to hear person_1 describe anything.
`` Good heavens !"
she exclaimed.
`` So that is a burning mountain ! But is it not dangerous to the people round about ?"
`` Whole cities have been destroyed ,"
he answered ; `` for instance , Pompeii and Herculaneum"
`` But the poor people ! -- And you saw all that with your own eyes ?"
`` For you are a continuation of Thorwaldsen ,"
she said to person_1.
And it seemed to person_1 that mamma had in this instance said a clever thing.
person_1 undertook to take a bust of person_0 and of his mother-in-law.
`` I suppose it 's only on our account ,"
`` It is highly necessary that I should mould the clay myself ,"
he replied.
`` Ah , yes , you are so very polite ,"
retorted mamma ; and person_0 silently pressed his hand , still soiled by the clay.
And person_0 's beauty held person_1 fast , filled his soul , and seized and mastered him.
`` Pygmalion received his Galatea ,"
so one of the songs said.

aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Ah , that 's your mythologies ,"
said mamma-in-law.
Next day the youthful pair started for Copenhagen , where they were to live.
Mamma-in-law accompanied them , `` to take care of the commonplace ,"
as she said , meaning the domestic economy.
The magic of form had enchanted him.
Sophy was not pretty.
`` Thank Heaven that we are in our own four walls again ,"
was the exclamation of mother and daughter when they came home , a year after.
`` There 's no pleasure in traveling ,"
said mamma-in-law.
`` To tell the truth , it 's very wearisome -- I beg pardon for saying so.
I got tired at last of those endless Madonnas ; one seemed to be turning a Madonna oneself !"
`` And what bad living you get !"
said person_0.

He took poor Peter by the hand , and led him between some cliffs to a great cavern.
Peter did so , and the angel sang to him and rocked him until he was al seep.
Then they awoke , and were with him on earth , and were called the twelve apostles.
Legend 3 The Rose There was once a poor woman who had two children.
The youngest had to go every day into the forest to fetch wood.
The child told her mother this , but at first she would not believe it.
The mother put the rose in water.
On the same morning , the rose was in full bloom.
The man answered , `` By poverty and humility.
He said to the servants , `` Go and tell my parents that I have come back again"
But the servants did not believe it , and laughed and left him standing there.
But one of them was ill-natured and said , `` Why should the beggar have the good food ?"
As , however , his illness increased , he desired to receive the last sacrament.
and drove away the poor creature with harsh words.
When the woman saw that she was terrified and told him what had occurred.
She had her two youngest children in her arms , and the three eldest were lying dead.
God has already satisfied the hunger of three of us , and he will hearken to our supplications likewise"
He said carelessly to himself , `` There , that one is getting his deserts !"
He alone sits in judgement.
However , if thou wilt do penance and repent thy sins , he will forgive thee"
That is the penance which the Lord lays on thee"
Then said he , `` Good woman , keep me with you in your house for this night ;"
and the woman was compassionate , and let herself be persuaded.
At midnight the robbers came home and blustered and stormed.
The robbers asked , `` What has he done ?"
`` Old man ,"
cried they , `` tell us thy sins"
Thus the Lord had once more received him into his favor.
`` Willingly ,"
answered the waggoner , `` but I have no glass in which I can give thee the wine"
The little flower is still always called Our Lady 's Little Glass.
The priest said , `` If he believes that , we will leave him inside"
So he went to him , and asked if he had any inclination to work.
`` Yes ,"
Next Sunday thou shalt go with me to the wedding"
`` No ,"
answered the image , `` thou alone"
She was alarmed , left the strawberries where they were , and hastened away.
She hid herself behind a hazel-bush , and stood there until the adder had crept away again.
Once upon a time there lived a King who had seven Queens , but no children.
`` No ,"
`` Poor souls !"
Hearing this , the lad was delighted beyond measure , and gave up the pigeon at once.
`` She will not fail to give them ,"
Never were such rejoicings as these few words produced.
Drawing his bow , he shot one , and it came fluttering past the window.
Then the lad did as he had been told bravely.
The Jogi , seeing the lad , called out fiercely , `` What do you want here ?"
One fell dead just beneath the window where the white Queen was sitting.
Kill the lad , and sprinkle his blood like water !"
; so she set off to see what had happened.
`` Do n't you disobey orders again !"
grumbled the old hag , `` or next time I 'll leave you alone.
Now be off , before I repent of my kindness !"
`` Yes ,"
and because of its size , they called it Thumbling.
`` Oh father ,"
`` Well ,"
answered the man , `` for once we will try it"
two strange men came towards him.
`` My word !"
`` That ca n't be right ,"
said the other , `` we will follow the cart and see where it stops"
We will buy him"
They went to the peasant and said , `` Sell us the little man.
He shall be well treated with us"
`` No ,"
Then the father parted with him to the two men for a handsome bit of money.
`` Where wilt thou sit ?"
they said to him.
`` Good evening , gentlemen , just go home without me ,"
he cried to them , and mocked them.
They ran thither and stuck their sticks into the mouse-hole , but it was all lost labor.
When Thumbling saw that they were gone , he crept back out of the subterranean passage.
`` It is so dangerous to walk on the ground in the dark ,"
said he ; `` how easily a neck or a leg is broken !"
Fortunately he knocked against an empty snail-shell.
`` Thank God !"
said he.
`` In that I can pass the night in safety ,"
and got into it.
`` I could tell thee that ,"
cried Thumbling , interrupting them.
`` What was that ?"
said one of the thieves in fright , `` I heard some one speaking"
`` But where art thou ?"
`` Just look on the ground , and observe from whence my voice comes ,"
he replied.
There the thieves at length found him , and lifted him up.
`` Thou little imp , how wilt thou help us ?"
they said.
`` A great deal ,"
`` Come then ,"
they said , `` and we will see what thou canst do"
But he had other things to go through.
`` Ah , heavens !"
cried he , `` how have I got into the fulling mill ?"
but he soon discovered where he was.
`` In this little room the windows are forgotten ,"
said he , `` and no sun shines in , neither will a candle be brought"
`` Thou art mad ,"
replied the pastor ; but he went himself to the byre to see what was there.
A hungry wolf ran thither , and swallowed the whole stomach at one gulp.
Thumbling did not lose courage.
`` Perhaps ,"
thought he , `` the wolf will listen to what I have got to say ,"
`` Where is it to be had ?"
said the wolf.
and he described to him exactly his father 's house.
`` Wilt thou be quiet ,"
said the wolf , `` thou wilt waken up the people !"
`` Eh , what ,"
replied the little fellow , `` thou hast eaten thy fill , and I will make merry likewise ,"
and began once more to scream with all his strength.
`` Stay behind ,"
said the man , when they entered the room.
and bade the woman take away her scythe , that Thumbling might not be hurt with it.
`` Ah ,"
said the father , `` what sorrow we have gone through for thy sake"
`` Yes father , I have gone about the world a great deal.
Thank heaven , I breathe fresh air again !"
`` Where hast thou been , then ?"
said his parents , and they embraced and kissed their dear Thumbling.
`` Stop ,"
said he , `` I shall not be content with this.
He said to him , `` Wilt thou be my servant and go with me ?"
`` Yes ,"
The master said to him , `` Huntsman , what art thou going to shoot ?"
`` Oh , come with me ,"
`` Good gracious ! what are you doing up there ?"
`` Oh , come with me ,"
said the man.
`` If we four are together , we shall carry the whole world before us !"
Then the master said , `` You have arranged things very comfortably to have a rest"
`` I am a runner ,"
`` Oh , go with me.
If we five are together , we shall carry the whole world before us"
`` I must not wear it otherwise ,"
`` Oh , come with me ,"
said the master.
`` If we six are together , we can carry the whole world before us"
emptied his pitcher , and ran on.
Then said he , `` The King 's daughter shall still not prevail against us ;"
`` Behold !"
And he said to them , `` You shall now make merry together , and eat and drink ,"
And when they were inside , he ordered the doors to be shut and bolted.
`` He shall not succeed , however ,"
said the one with the cap.
But the cook replied , `` There is heat enough there , just look yourself"
`` Oh , yes , Lord King ,"
and he was alarmed and said , `` What a lot of gold he can carry away !"
`` Bring more ,"
cried he , `` these few crumbs do n't fill it"
`` I will examine it no longer ,"
said he , `` but will just take what comes , so long as the sack is but full"
So he took it on his back , and went away with his comrades.
`` What say you ?"
And he closed one nostril , and with the other blew on the two regiments.
When the King was informed of this he said , `` Let the rascals go.
They have the best of it"
The emperor 's favorite horse was shod with gold.
It had a golden shoe on each of its feet.
And a beetle came creeping forth.
`` First the great ones ,"
And so saying , he stretched out his thin legs.
`` And pray what do you want ?"
asked the smith.
`` Golden shoes , to be sure ,"
replied the beetle.
`` Why , you must be out of your senses ,"
cried the smith.
`` Do you want to have golden shoes too ?"
`` Golden shoes ? certainly ,"
replied the beetle.
`` But _ why _ is the horse to have golden shoes ? Do n't you understand that ?"
asked the smith.
`` Understand ? I understand that it is a personal slight offered to myself ,"
cried the beetle.
`` Go along !"
said the smith.
`` You 're a rude fellow !"
`` Is it not beautiful here ?"
`` How sweet it is here -- how beautiful it is !"
`` I 'm accustomed to better things ,"
said the beetle.
`` Do you call _ this _ beautiful ? Why , there is not so much as a dung-heap"
`` How beautiful the world is !"
`` How conceited you are !"
exclaimed the stag-beetle.
To have wings to fly ! why , we can fly now ;"
and he spread his wings and flew away.
`` I do n't want to be annoyed , and yet I am annoyed ,"
he said , as he flew off.
Soon afterwards he fell down upon a great lawn.
For awhile he lay there and feigned slumber ; at last he fell asleep in earnest.
Suddenly a heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds.
He therefore remained lying where he was.
It was linen that had been placed there to bleach.
Towards morning he crept forth : he was very much out of temper about the climate.
On the linen two frogs were sitting.
Their bright eyes absolutely gleamed with pleasure.
`` Wonderful weather this !"
one of them cried.
`` How refreshing ! And the linen keeps the water together so beautifully.
My hind legs seem to quiver as if I were going to swim"
`` I should like to know ,"
What delicious dampness ! It is really as if one were lying in a wet ditch.
Whoever does not rejoice in this , certainly does not love his fatherland"
`` Have you been in the emperor 's stable ?"
asked the beetle : `` there the dampness is warm and refreshing.
But the frogs either did not or would not understand him.
`` I never ask a question twice !"
said the beetle , after he had already asked this one three times without receiving any answer.
Here dwelt several families of earwigs ; and these did not require much , only sociality.
`` Our son has engaged himself ,"
said one mother.
It 's very artless and loveable , that ; and being engaged will keep him steady.
What joy for a mother !"
`` Our son ,"
Beetle ?"
for she knew the stranger by his horny coat.
`` You are both quite right ,"
`` Now , you also see _ my _ little earwig ,"
observed a third mother and a fourth ; `` they are lovely little things , and highly amusing.
`` Yes , they are always busy about something , the little rogues !"
`` That is quite out in the big world , on the other side of the ditch ,"
answered an earwig.
`` But I shall try to get so far ,"
And by the ditch he met several friends ; beetles , all of them.
`` Here we live ,"
they said.
`` We are very comfortable here.
Might we ask you to step down into this rich mud ? You must be fatigued after your journey"
`` Certainly ,"
replied the beetle.
It is really quite refreshing to be among one 's companions once more"
`` Perhaps you come from some muck-heap ?"
observed the oldest of them.
`` Indeed , I come from a much higher place ,"
replied the beetle.
I am traveling on a secret embassy.
You must not ask me any questions , for I ca n't betray my secret"
With this the beetle stepped down into the rich mud.
`` Not one of them is engaged yet ,"
said their mother ; and the beetle maidens tittered again , this time from embarrassment.
`` I have never seen greater beauties in the royal stables ,"
exclaimed the beetle , who was now resting himself.
`` Do n't spoil my girls ,"
But of course your intentions are serious , and therefore I give you my blessing"
`` Hurrah !"
cried all the other beetles together ; and our friend was engaged.
Immediately after the betrothal came the marriage , for there was no reason for delay.
`` I have allowed myself to be taken in ,"
said our beetle to himself.
`` And now there 's nothing for it but to take _ them _ in , in turn"
So said , so done.
`` Oh ,"
He has gone away , and has left his wife a burden upon our hands"
-LRB- Illustration : THE SCHOLARS FIND THE BEETLE.
said the mother.
`` Fie on the villain who forsook her !"
In the morning two persons came to the ditch.
`` Allah sees the black beetle in the black stone and in the black rock.
Is not that written in the Koran ?"
The second person , an older scholar , voted for carrying him home.
`` Very comfortable it is here ,"
said he.
That was all very charming.
When the beetle woke up , he crept forth and looked around him.
`` This is an incomparable plenty of plants ,"
cried the beetle.
I will just see if I can find any one with whom I may associate.
I 'm proud , certainly , and I 'm proud of being so"
Suddenly a hand seized the beetle , and pressed him , and turned him round and round.
First he was wrapped in a vine leaf , and then put into warm trousers-pocket.
Then the boy went rapidly towards the great lake that lay at the end of the garden.
Now he was a sailor , and had to sail away.
The little ship sailed away.
Then a fly came and paid him a visit.
`` What beautiful weather !"
said the fly.
`` I 'll rest here , and sun myself.
You have an agreeable time of it"
`` You speak without knowing the facts ,"
replied the beetle.
`` Do n't you see that I 'm a prisoner ?"
`` Ah ! but I 'm not a prisoner ,"
observed the fly ; and he flew away accordingly.
`` Well , now I know the world ,"
said the beetle to himself.
`` It is an abominable world.
I 'm the only honest person in it.
That is what annoys me more than all.
If I had received golden shoes , I should have become an ornament to the stable.
Now the stable has lost me , and the world has lost me.
It is all over !"
But all was not over yet.
A boat , in which there were a few young girls , came rowing up.
`` Look , yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along ,"
said one of the girls.
`` There 's a little creature bound fast to it ,"
said another.
`` Creep , creep -- fly , fly -- if thou canst ,"
she said.
`` Liberty is a splendid thing"
The beetle clung fast to the mane , and sat there a short time to recover himself.
he cried.
`` But what was I saying ? Yes , now I remember.
That 's a good thought , and quite correct.
The smith asked me why the golden shoes were given to the horse.
Now I 'm quite clear about the answer.
They were given to the horse on _ my _ account"
And now the beetle was in a good temper again.
`` Travelling expands the mind rarely ,"
said he.
`` The world is not so bad , upon the whole ,"
said the beetle ; `` but one must know how to take things as they come"
The roof reached almost down to the ground.
Then I would clench my fist and cry , `` We will kill the Turks !"
For several days and nights we had been lonely in our hut , when my father came home.
He himself had been wounded , and my mother bound up his arm.
The wound was deep , and the thick sheepskin was stiff with frozen blood.
The little maiden was to be my sister.
How radiantly beautiful she looked ! Even my mother 's eyes were not more gentle than hers.
I often heard of the strange good custom.
So now the little girl was my sister.
One day there came three Frankish men.
Their dress was different from ours.
I never thought of it ; but Anastasia and I were really one.
Two nights afterwards , other men , armed with knives and muskets , came into our tent.
They were Albanians , brave men , my mother told me.
They only stayed a short time.
They wrapped tobacco in strips of paper and smoked it.
I remember they were undecided as to the road they were to take.
But they had to make a choice.
They went , and my father went with them.
Soon afterwards we heard the sound of firing.
I cried and cried till I fell asleep.
When we were set free it was the time of the holy Easter feast.
We went into a church that gleamed with pictures painted on a golden ground.
In the middle of the floor stood a coffin filled with roses.
`` The Lord Christ is pictured there in the form of a beautiful rose ,"
said my mother ; and the priest announced , `` Christ is risen !"
and thus it was that for the first time I met person_0.
Suddenly there was a splash in the water , and the boat rocked violently.
The summer came.
The sun burned so hot that the leaves turned yellow on the trees.
Not a single herdsman did we meet , not one solitary hut did we pass.
and the lower orders kiss the ground on which he has stepped.
She was now a beautiful grown girl , and I had become a stout stripling.
`` How much you know !"
I exclaimed ; `` what wonders you can tell of !"
`` But you have told me the finest thing , after all ,"
he replied.
Anastasia blushed like a young rose , and my mother kissed person_0.
Every one could see that we were about to go through a solemn ceremony.
We knelt down on the altar steps , and Anastasia came before us.
No Greek girl had more beautiful ornaments than she.
Her countenance glowed , and her eyes were like two stars.
`` Yes ,"
we replied.
My secret is his , my happiness is his.
Self-sacrifice , patience -- everything in me belongs to him as to me ?"
And we again answered , `` Yes"
Then she joined our hands and kissed us on the forehead , and we again prayed silently.
When we rose , I saw my mother standing by the church door weeping heartily.
Every thought of our souls lay clear before each of us , and I seized his hand.
`` And whom do you love ?"
asked person_0 , and his face and neck grew red as fire.
`` I love Anastasia ,"
I replied -- and his hand trembled in mine , and he became pale as a corpse.
I saw it ; I understood the cause ; and I believe _ my _ hand trembled.
`` And she shall be thine !"
he exclaimed , `` thine ! I may not deceive thee , nor will I do so.
I also love her ; but to-morrow I depart.
Thou must , thou shalt take it"
And we wandered home silently across the mountains.
It was late in the evening when we stood at my mother 's door.
Anastasia held the lamp upwards as we entered ; my mother was not there.
She gazed at person_0 with a beautifully mournful gaze.
`` To-morrow you are going from us ,"
she said : `` I am very sorry for it"
`` Sorry !"
Anastasia trembled and burst into tears.
Before daybreak he rose , kissed us all , said farewell , and went away.
He had given all his money to my mother for us.
Anastasia was my betrothed , and a few days afterwards she became my wife"
After a long time , however , a son was promised to her.
His name shall be Raja person_0 , and he shall be known far and wide"
`` I must go and see where the voices come from !"
So Raja person_0 was comforted , and began to make ready for fortune.
person_0 had started off to play chaupur with King Sarkap.
And immediately the headless corpse arose and sat beside Raja person_0.
Otherwise he will always win"
The Prince smiled , saying , `` What help could _ you _ give _ me _ ?"
Nevertheless , he kept the hair and went on his way.
`` Fair sisters !"
quoth person_0 gaily , `` give me my task and I will perform it"
Then person_0 said , `` Separate the millet seed from the sand"
`` Is that all ?"
As soon as I 've eaten my bread I 'll go forth and cut off his head !"
But the food was poisoned.
I am his sworn enemy , and I eat not of his salt !"
So Raja person_0 put the kitten in his pocket , and went to play chaupur with the King.
Take thy right hand , and place it as I said"
Time enough to take them away when you have won my head !"
So person_0 won , and took back his arms.
So person_0 won the second stake , and took back Bhaunr , the Arab steed.
Grant us our request , -- Unloose these chains , and live for ever blest !"
And Raja person_0 hearkened to them , and bade King Sarkap set them at liberty.
It has been written , and even printed.
Grown older , she would take cockchafers and beetles , and spit them on pins.
`` The cockchafer is reading ,"
person_0 would say.
`` See how he turns the leaf round and round !"
`` Your headstrong will requires something strong to break it !"
her own mother often said.
And that is what she really did.
She looked well , and her presumption increased.
And that 's the story.
-LRB- Illustration : INGE TURNS BACK AT THE SIGHT OF HER POOR MOTHER.
A box of mud is a palace compared with the moor woman 's brewery.
The moor woman was at home , and on that day there were visitors in the brewery.
`` That 's a girl who has ability !"
She 'll make a capital statue to stand in my grandson 's antechamber"
And person_0 was given up to her , and this is how person_0 came into Bogey 's domain.
That was a never-ending antechamber.
It would take too long to describe the various sorts of torture that were found there together.
`` That 's the fruit of wishing to keep one 's feet neat and tidy ,"
she said to herself.
`` Just look how they 're all staring at me !"
`` It must be a great pleasure to look at me !"
thought person_0 , `` and indeed I have a pretty face and fine clothes"
But she had not considered how her clothes had been soiled in the moor woman 's brewhouse.
That was very disconcerting.
`` But all the rest of them down here look horrible ,"
she observed to herself , and derived consolation from the thought.
The worst of all was the terrible hunger that tormented her.
`` If this lasts much longer ,"
she said , `` I shall not be able to bear it"
But she had to bear it , and it lasted on and on.
That was thy ruin , person_0.
Thou hast sorely grieved thy mother"
`` Greatly hast thou grieved thy mother , person_0 ,"
said the mother ; `` yes , yes , I thought it would be thus"
`` Oh that I never had been born !"
thought person_0 ; `` it would have been far better.
But what use is my mother 's weeping now ?"
`` They should have punished me ,"
thought person_0 , `` and have driven out the whims I had in my head"
`` That I should have to bear so much evil for this !"
thought person_0 ; `` the others ought to be punished , too , for their sins.
Yes , then there would be plenty of punishing to do.
Ah , how I 'm being tortured !"
And her heart became harder than her outward form.
`` Here in this company one ca n't even become better ,"
And her heart was full of anger and malice against all men.
`` Now they 've something to talk about at last up yonder.
Ah , how I 'm being tortured !"
Thus , even the children 's mouths spoke hard words of her.
`` But will person_0 never come up here again ?"
asked the little girl.
And the reply was , `` She will never come up again"
`` Yes , then she might come ; but she will not beg pardon ,"
was the reply.
`` I should be so glad if she would ,"
said the little girl ; and she was quite inconsolable.
`` I 'll give my doll and all my playthings if she may only come up.
It 's too dreadful -- poor person_0 !"
And these words penetrated to person_0 's inmost heart , and seemed to do her good.
It was the first time any one had said , `` Poor person_0 ,"
It was the last sigh of her dying mother.
But person_0 knew right well that her good mistress would never come to the place where she was.
And again time went on -- a long , bitter time.
They were two gentle eyes closing upon earth.
For weeks these toneless songs stirred within the bird ; at last , the holy Christmas-time approached.
It was a hard winter.
`` Yonder is a sea-swallow , flying away across the water ,"
said the children when they saw the white bird.
Now it dived into the sea , and now it rose again into the clear sunlight.
The large one belonged to a rich man , and the small one to a poor man.
The Lord answered , `` I only ask for a night 's lodging"
Go somewhere else for a lodging ,"
and with this he shut down the window and left the Lord standing there.
`` Pass the night with me , it is already dark ,"
said he ; `` you can not go any further to-night"
This pleased the Lord , and he went in.
`` With all my heart ,"
he answered , `` I will go and offer it to him ;"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the man ; `` if I can have that , too , I should like it very much"
Run over and see how that has come to pass"
`` Quick !"
said his wife , `` get on your horse.
`` Yes ,"
said the Lord ; `` if I ever come back again , I will do so"
He patted its neck , and said , `` Gently , Lisa ,"
but the horse only began new tricks.
And thus was his first wish fulfilled.
`` I have still two wishes left ,"
said he , and comforted himself with that thought.
The saddle hurt his back , and he had not yet any idea what to wish for.
`` If I were to wish for all the riches and treasures in the world ,"
But I will manage so that there is nothing at all left me to wish for afterwards"
Then he really did feel warm.
The father said , `` Yes , if I can get it , you shall have it ,"
kissed all three , and set out.
`` Aha , you come just at the right moment !"
`` He who tries to steal my singing , soaring lark ,"
he cried , `` will I devour"
Then the man said , `` I did not know that the bird belonged to thee.
But she consoled him and said , `` Dearest father , indeed your promise must be fulfilled.
I will go thither and soften the lion , so that I may return to thee safely"
On her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle.
They lived happily together , remained awake at night , and slept in the daytime.
She said , `` Yes , I should very much like to see my father again ,"
and went thither , accompanied by the lions.
So they went away together , and took with them their little child as well.
And as she thought to herself , `` In this no man can help thee ,"
`` No ,"
`` No ,"
`` No ,"
Then she went thither , and found everything as the night wind had said.
There stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was again forsaken.
and opened the casket that the sun had given her.
A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself.
answered she , `` but for flesh and blood"
The bride said , `` Yes ,"
intending to cheat her as on the former evening.
The prince said , `` Pour out the draught by the bed-side"
May Heaven pity us.
If our mother only knew ! Come , we will go forth together into the wide world"
And if only the brother had had his human form it would have been a delightful life.
For some time they were alone like this in the wilderness.
But it happened that the King of the country held a great hunt in the forest.
`` Oh ,"
and he begged so much that at last she agreed.
`` But ,"
Then the young roebuck sprang away ; so happy was he and so merry in the open air.
and saw that the door was opened for him , and was shut again at once.
Then the King said , `` To-morrow we will hunt once more"
The little sister , however , was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt.
I will not let you out"
`` Then you will have me die of grief ,"
`` Yes , indeed ,"
answered the maiden , `` but the little roe must go with me , I can not leave him"
`` Only be quiet ,"
Then she went quite silently out of the door again.
And she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she disappeared.
The King dared not speak to her , but on the next night he watched again.
She answered , `` Yes , I am your dear wife ,"
The King ordered both to be led before the judge , and judgment was delivered against them.
`` What can that be but my apple-tree ?"
thought the miller , and said , `` Yes ,"
and gave a written promise to the stranger.
and then he went.
`` Ah , husband ,"
The devil appeared quite early , but he could not come near to her.
The miller was afraid , and did so.
The miller was shocked and answered , `` How could I cut off my own child 's hands ?"
The father became alarmed , and promised to obey him.
Help me in my need , and forgive me the harm I do thee"
She replied , `` Dear father , do with me what you will , I am your child"
Thereupon she laid down both her hands , and let them be cut off.
Then he had to give in , and had lost all right over her.
Then she knelt down , called on person_0 the Lord , and prayed.
And now she went into the garden and the angel went with her.
She saw a tree covered with beautiful pears , but they were all counted.
When the spirit had eaten the pear , it went back again"
The King said , `` If it be as thou sayest , I will watch with thee to-night"
All three seated themselves beneath the tree and watched.
She replied , `` I am no spirit , but an unhappy mortal deserted by all but person_0"
Then she gave birth to a fine boy.
So the old mother made haste to write and announce the joyful news to him.
The old mother was terribly shocked when she received the letter , and could not believe it.
Go forth into the wide world with thy child , and never come here again"
The poor woman tied her child on her back , and went away with eyes full of tears.
A snow-white maiden came out of the little house and said , `` Welcome , Lady Queen ,"
and conducted her inside.
Then said the poor woman , `` From whence knowest thou that I was a queen ?"
and she showed the tokens , the tongue and eyes.
During the whole of this time he neither ate nor drank , but person_0 supported him.
and asked him from whence he came.
Then he lay down to sleep , and put a handkerchief over his face.
and said to her , `` Go out with thy child , thy husband hath come"
So she went to the place where he lay , and the handkerchief fell from his face.
Then said she , `` Sorrowful , pick up thy father 's handkerchief , and cover his face again"
The child picked it up , and put it over his face again.
When the King heard that , he got up , and asked who they were.
Then said she , `` I am thy wife , and that is thy son , Sorrowful"
And he saw her living hands , and said , `` My wife had silver hands"
She answered , `` The good person_0 has caused my natural hands to grow again ;"
Away she quickly flew , And Blase informed , what Ninny had in view.
She began to weep , and ran to her step-mother and told her of the mishap.
I am Mother Holle.
She stayed some time with Mother Holle , and then she became sad.
Thereupon she took her by the hand , and led her to a large door.
`` You shall have that because you have been so industrious ,"
Then she threw her shuttle into the well , and jumped in after it.
But the lazy thing answered , `` As if I had any wish to make myself dirty ?"
and on she went.
But she answered , `` I like that ! one of you might fall on my head ,"
and so went on.
Mother Holle was soon tired of this , and gave her notice to leave.
`` That is the reward for your service ,"
said Mother Holle , and shut the door.
But the pitch stuck fast to her , and could not be got off as long as she lived"
and he left the little man standing and went on.
And this was the little gray man 's doing.
and he left the little man standing and went on.
Then Dummling said , `` Father , do let me go and cut wood"
There stands an old tree , cut it down , and you will find something at the roots"
Then the little man took leave of him.
The eldest thought , `` I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather ,"
But she did not understand why she was to keep away.
`` The others are there ,"
she thought , `` I may as well be there too ,"
So they had to spend the night with the goose.
and running after him he took him by the sleeve , but was also held fast to it.
Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife , and the wedding was celebrated.
After the King 's death , Dummling inherited the kingdom and lived a long time contentedly with his wife"
They all three traveled away together , and came to an ant-hill.
There they saw a little gray man , who was sitting at a table.
At last the turn came to Simpleton also , who sought in the moss.
by Brothers Grimm A girl from Brakel once went to St.
Between Werrel and Soist there lived a man whose name was Knoist , and he had three sons.
One was blind , the other lame , and the third stark-naked.
Once on a time they went into a field , and there they saw a hare.
They all three got into the one with no bottom to it.
`` How truly happy is that one Who can from holy water run !"
It was far in January , and a terrible fall of snow was pelting down.
Coaches and horses seemed frosted with sugar.
Towards evening it grew calm.
The sky looked as if it had been swept , and had become more lofty and transparent.
`` Piep !"
I 'm dissatisfied , and I 've a right to be so"
`` Yes ; and the people ran about and fired off shots to celebrate the new year ,"
People have made a mistake in reckoning the time !"
`` That they have !"
When spring comes , then the year begins , and I reckon according to that"
`` But when will spring come ?"
the others inquired.
`` It will come when the stork comes back.
`` Yes , that may be all very well ,"
`` And we will fly into the country to see if spring is not coming !"
And away they flew.
The sharp winds swept across the snow-covered fields.
The horses ran till they smoked again.
`` Very long ,"
sounded from the next snow-covered hill , far over the field.
`` Who is that old man yonder ?"
asked the sparrows.
`` I know who he is ,"
`` I know who the old man is.
It is Winter , the old man of last year.
Yes , Winter bears sway here.
Ugh ! the cold makes you shiver , does it not , you little ones ?"
`` Yes.
Did I not tell the truth ?"
And one week passed away , and two passed away.
Then a sunbeam glided along over the lake , and made it shine like burnished tin.
`` Kee-wit ! kee-wit ! Is spring coming now ?"
`` Spring !"
`` That 's what I call spring ,"
cried each of the sparrows.
`` Now we shall get our rights , and have amends for the stern winter"
And the little maiden strewed flowers all around.
That was beautiful to behold.
All nature seemed to say , `` There is plenty , and there shall be plenty always !"
Hot waves of air came through the corn , that became yellower and yellower.
Every breath of air was hushed , every bird was mute.
And days went by , and weeks went by.
`` What wealth !"
Now they are already ploughing again in the field.
The people want to gain more and more.
`` Do you wish to see the golden fruit ?"
said the man : `` then rejoice"
But the Queen of the Year became more and more silent , and paler and paler.
`` It blows cold ,"
she said , `` and night brings damp mists.
I long for the land of my childhood"
She looked up at the nests , which stood empty.
I wish him a pleasant journey !"
And then the church bells rang for the Christmas time.
`` The bells ring for the new-born ,"
said the Ruler of the Year.
`` May there be joy in the room , and under the green boughs ,"
said the Ruler of the Year.
In a few weeks he had become a very old man , white as snow.
`` But the might is still thine ,"
said the Angel of Christmas ; `` the might and not the rest.
Let the snow lie warmly upon the young seed.
Learn to bear it , that another receives homage while thou yet reignest.
Learn to bear being forgotten while thou art yet alive.
The hour of thy release will come when spring appears"
`` And when will spring come ?"
asked Winter.
`` It will come when the stork returns"
`` When will spring come ?"
asked the sparrows.
`` Then we shall have good times , and a better rule.
The old one was worth nothing"
`` When will spring come ?"
asked the sparrows.
`` The spring !"
sounded like an echo from the hills on which the snow lay.
The sun shone warmer , the snow melted , and the birds twittered , `` Spring is coming !"
And aloft through the air came the first stork , and the second followed him.
And the story of the year was done.
`` That is all very well ,"
but they never had one.
When eleven of them had made their promises , suddenly the thirteenth came in.
And , without saying a word more , she turned round and left the room.
She climbed up the narrow winding-staircase , and reached a little door.
`` Good day , old dame ,"
said the King 's daughter ; `` what are you doing there ?"
`` I am spinning ,"
said the old woman , and nodded her head.
`` What sort of thing is that , that rattles round so merrily ?"
said the girl , and she took the spindle and wanted to spin too.
And the wind fell , and on the trees before the castle not a leaf moved again.
But the story of the beautiful sleeping `` Briar-rose ,"
Then the youth said , `` I am not afraid , I will go and see the beautiful Briar-rose"
The good old man might dissuade him as he would , he did not listen to his words.
There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.
At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.
Then her husband was alarmed , and asked , `` What aileth thee , dear wife ?"
`` Ah ,"
She at once made herself a salad of it , and ate it with much relish.
If he was to have any rest , her husband must once more descend into the garden.
`` How canst thou dare ,"
`` Ah ,"
Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun.
Then he heard a song , which was so charming that he stood still and listened.
This was Rapunzel , who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.
Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair , and the enchantress climbed up to her.
`` If that is the ladder by which one mounts , I will for once try my fortune ,"
Immediately the hair fell down and the King 's son climbed up.
and she said yes , and laid her hand in his.
`` Ah ! thou wicked child ,"
she let the hair down.
`` Aha !"
Rapunzel is lost to thee ; thou wilt never see her more"
He escaped with his life , but the thorns into which he fell , pierced his eyes.
In former days every sound still had its meaning and application.
When the smith 's hammer resounded , it cried , `` Strike away ! strike away"
When the carpenter 's plane grated , it said , `` Here goes ! here goes"
and then answered quickly , `` The miller ! the miller !"
One alone amongst them , the green plover , was opposed to this.
He retired into a solitary and unfrequented marsh , and showed himself no more among his fellows.
`` What , what , what is going to be done ?"
she cackled ; but the cock calmed his beloved hen , and said , `` Only rich people ,"
and told her what they had on hand.
It was decided , however , that the one who could fly the highest should be King.
and that all would pass off peaceably.
On a given signal , therefore , the whole troop rose up in the air.
The little birds were , however , soon left behind.
They could go no farther , and fell back to the ground.
and began to let himself down again.
The birds beneath him at once cried to him.
`` Thou must be our King , no one has flown so high as thou"
`` Except me ,"
screamed the little fellow without a name , who had crept into the breast-feathers of the eagle.
`` Thou , our King ?"
cried the birds angrily.
`` Thou hast compassed it by trick and cunning !"
So they made another condition.
He should be King who could go down lowest in the ground.
`` Thou our King !"
cried the birds still more angrily.
`` Dost thou think thy cunning shall prevail ?"
They determined to keep him a prisoner in the hole and starve him out.
The owl alone remained standing by the mouse-hole , gazing steadfastly into it with her great eyes.
So she shut one eye , and with the other looked straight at the mouse-hole.
The little fellow soon observed that , and slipped away.
The girl went home , and told her father what the woman had said.
The man said , `` What shall I do ? Marriage is a joy and also a torment"
She informed her father how it had turned out.
`` Good heavens !"
`` Wilt thou contradict me again ?"
Far and wide there was nothing but snow , and not a green blade to be seen.
When she got into the wood she saw a small house out of which peeped three dwarfs.
She wished them good day , and knocked modestly at the door.
They cried , `` Come in ,"
The elves said , `` Give us , too , some of it"
`` Willingly ,"
she said , and divided her bit of bread in two and gave them the half.
`` Ah ,"
Then said the first , `` My gift is , that she shall every day grow more beautiful"
The third said , `` My gift is , that a king shall come and take her to wife"
`` Now look at her arrogance ,"
cried the step-sister , `` to throw about gold in that way !"
The girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house.
`` Give us some of it ,"
`` Humph ! Sweep for yourselves ,"
she answered , `` I am not your servant"
The first said , `` I grant that she may grow uglier every day"
The third said , `` I grant that she may die a miserable death"
The maiden looked for strawberries outside , but as she found none , she went angrily home.
`` I am a poor girl , and I am rinsing yarn"
`` Ah , yes , with all my heart ,"
she answered , for she was glad to get away from the mother and sister.
The scullion said , `` They are sleeping soundly , too"
Then it asked again , `` What does little baby mine ?"
He answered , `` Sleepeth in her cradle fine"
`` The wretch deserves nothing better ,"
`` Then ,"
said the King , `` Thou hast pronounced thine own sentence ;"
The tale is this , we purpose to relate ; And full particulars we now will state.
Nor that the Abbess should , within her soul , Retain what might injuriously control.
This point of honor is another ill , In which the faculty confess no skill.
The more he tried , the ringlet less inclined To drop the curvature so closely twined.
`` Now , God bless the jam to my use ,"
cried the little tailor , `` and give me health and strength ;"
`` This wo n't taste bitter ,"
said he , `` but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite"
`` Hola ! who invited you ?"
said the little tailor , and drove the unbidden guests away.
struck it mercilessly on them.
`` Art thou a fellow of that sort ?"
said he , and could not help admiring his own bravery.
`` The whole town shall know of this !"
`` What , the town !"
he continued , `` The whole world shall hear of it !"
and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb 's tail.
In front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket.
It had to go into his pocket with the cheese.
Hast thou any inclination to go with me ?"
The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor , and said , `` Thou ragamuffin ! Thou miserable creature !"
`` Oh , indeed ?"
The giant read , `` Seven at one stroke ,"
`` Do that likewise ,"
said the giant , `` if thou hast strength ?"
`` Is that all ?"
said the tailor , `` that is child 's play with us !"
`` Faith ,"
said he , `` that was a little better , was n't it ?"
The giant did not know what to say , and could not believe it of the little man.
Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high"
There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still a little child.
He looked at her , said nothing , and rode on.
but she still looked after him as long as she could distinguish the white feathers in his hat.
Before long , it had entirely vanished from her sight.
`` What do I see ?"
he cried ; `` the spindle certainly wants to show me the way !"
turned his horse about , and rode back with the golden thread.
Immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.
The shuttle leapt hither and thither , and everything seemed to grow of its own accord.
As the shuttle had run away , the girl sat down to sew.
`` Thou art the poorest and also the richest ,"
said he to her.
`` Come with me , thou shalt be my bride"
She did not speak , but she gave him her hand.
The spindle , shuttle , and needle were preserved in the treasure-chamber , and held in great honor"
Go , jealous husbands , books of cases burn ; Caresses lavish , and you 'll find return"
But one day person_0 was wandering through the woods when he caught sight of Jimmy.
Jimmy dodged behind a tree.
And person_0 saw Jimmy 's brother peep from behind another.
`` Hello !"
person_0 called.
`` I 'm glad to see you"
And he told the truth , too.
Jimmy and his brother hopped out from behind their trees.
`` Hello !"
said Jimmy.
`` We were just looking for you"
Probably he meant to say , `` We were just looking AT you"
He was somewhat upset by meeting person_0 ; for he knew that person_0 was angry with him.
`` Oh , ho ! You were , were you ?"
person_0 answered.
He began to slide down the tree he had been climbing.
Jimmy Rabbit and his brother edged a little further away.
`` Better not come too near us !"
he said.
`` We 've both got the pink-eye , and you do n't want to catch it"
person_0 paused and looked at the brothers.
Sure enough ! their eyes were as pink as anything.
`` Does it hurt much ?"
person_0 asked.
`` Well -- it does and it does n't ,"
Jimmy replied.
But you 'll be perfectly safe , so long as you do n't touch us"
`` How long does it last ?"
person_0 inquired.
`` Probably we 'll never get over it ,"
Jimmy Rabbit said cheerfully.
And his brother nodded his head , as much as to say , `` That 's so !"
person_0 Coon was just the least bit alarmed.
He really thought that there was something the matter with their eyes.
So person_0 thought it would be safer not to go too near them.
`` Well , it 's too bad ,"
he told Jimmy.
`` I 'm sorry.
I wanted to play with you"
`` Oh , that 's all right !"
Jimmy said.
`` We can play , just the same.
I 'll tell you what we 'll play.
We 'll play --"
`` Not barber-shop !"
person_0 interrupted.
`` I wo n't play barber-shop , I never liked that game"
Jimmy Rabbit started to smile.
But he turned his smile into a sneeze.
And he said -- `` We 'll play robber.
You 'll like that , I know.
And you can be the robber.
You look like one , anyhow"
That remark made person_0 Coon angry.
And he wished that Jimmy had n't the pink-eye.
He would have liked to make an end of him right then and there.
`` What do you mean ?"
he shouted.
`` Robber nothing ! I 'm just as good as you are !"
`` Of course , of course !"
Jimmy said hastily.
That 's why we want you to be the robber"
person_0 had slipped down his tree to the ground ; and now he looked down into the creek.
It was just as Jimmy said.
`` Come on !"
said Jimmy.
`` We ca n't play the game without you"
`` Well -- all right !"
said person_0.
He began to feel proud of his mask.
`` What shall I do ?"
`` You wait right here ,"
Jimmy ordered.
`` Hide behind that tree.
We 'll go into the woods.
You understand ?"
`` Of course !"
said person_0.
`` But hurry up ! Do n't be gone long"
`` Leave that to us ,"
said Jimmy Rabbit.
He winked at his brother ; and they started off together.
person_0 Coon did not see that wink.
They never came back at all.
And they told everybody about the trick they had played on person_0 Coon.
For a long time after that wherever person_0 went the forest-people called `` Robber !"
after him.
And Jasper Jay was the most annoying of all , because whenever he shouted `` Robber !"
he always laughed so loudly and so long.
His hoarse screech echoed through the woods.
And the worst of it was , everybody knew what he was laughing at"
The Jackal thought this reasonable , and let person_0 pass.
The Vulture thought this reasonable , and let person_0 pass.
`` I 'll tell you what you must do ,"
And Mr.
Tum-pa , tum-too !"
`` How very annoying !"
sighed the Eagle , thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip.
Tum-pa , tum too ; Tum-pa , tum-too ; Tum-pa , tum-too !"
Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip.
Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up person_0"
And when the child was born , the Queen died.
After a year had passed the King took to himself another wife.
the looking-glass answered -- `` Thou , O Queen , art the fairest of all !"
Then she was satisfied , for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth.
it answered -- `` Thou art fairer than all who are here , Lady Queen"
But more beautiful still is Snow-white , as I ween"
Then the Queen was shocked , and turned yellow and green with envy.
Kill her , and bring me back her heart as a token"
`` The wild beasts will soon have devoured you ,"
Everything in the cottage was small , but neater and cleaner than can be told.
Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side , and covered with snow-white counterpanes.
.
The first said , `` Who has been sitting on my chair ?"
The second , `` Who has been eating off my plate ?"
The third , `` Who has been taking some of my bread ?"
The fourth , `` Who has been eating my vegetables ?"
The fifth , `` Who has been using my fork ?"
The sixth , `` Who has been cutting with my knife ?"
The seventh , `` Who has been drinking out of my mug ?"
The others came up and each called out , `` Somebody has been lying in my bed too"
But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little Snow-white , who was lying asleep therein.
`` Oh , heavens ! oh , heavens !"
cried they , `` what a lovely child !"
When it was morning little Snow-white awoke , and was frightened when she saw the seven dwarfs.
But they were friendly and asked her what her name was.
`` My name is Snow-white ,"
she answered.
`` How have you come to our house ?"
said the dwarfs.
`` Yes ,"
said Snow-white , `` with all my heart ,"
and she stayed with them.
`` Good things , pretty things ,"
she answered ; `` stay-laces of all colors ,"
and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-coloured silk.
`` I may let the worthy old woman in ,"
thought Snow-white , and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.
`` Child ,"
`` Now I am the most beautiful ,"
said the Queen to herself , and ran away.
`` But now ,"
she said , `` I will think of something that shall put an end to you ,"
and by the help of witchcraft , which she understood , she made a poisonous comb.
Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman.
Little Snow-white looked out and said , `` Go away ; I can not let any one come in"
`` I suppose you can look ,"
said the old woman , and pulled the poisonous comb out and held it up.
It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled , and opened the door.
`` You paragon of beauty ,"
said the wicked woman , `` you are done for now ,"
and she went away.
But fortunately it was almost evening , when the seven dwarfs came home.
When she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage.
`` Snow-white shall die ,"
she cried , `` even if it costs me my life !"
She knocked at the door.
`` It is all the same to me ,"
answered the woman , `` I shall soon get rid of my apples.
There , I will give you one"
`` No ,"
said Snow-white , `` I dare not take anything"
`` Are you afraid of poison ?"
The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned.
But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead.
it answered at last -- `` Oh , Queen , in this land thou art fairest of all"
Then her envious heart had rest , so far as an envious heart can have rest.
They said , `` We could not bury her in the dark ground ,"
But the dwarfs answered , `` We will not part with it for all the gold in the world"
I will honor and prize her as my dearest possession"
And now the King 's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders.
`` Oh , heavens , where am I ?"
she cried.
The King 's son , full of joy , said , `` You are with me ,"
But Snow-white 's wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast.
Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes , and dance until she dropped down dead"
She sent away one after the other , and ridiculed them as well.
she said.
Another was too tall , `` Long and thin has little in"
The third was too short , `` Short and thick is never quick"
The fourth was too pale , `` As pale as death"
The fifth too red , `` A fighting-cock"
The sixth was not straight enough , `` A green log dried behind the stove"
`` Well ,"
she cried and laughed , `` he has a chin like a thrush 's beak !"
and from that time he got the name of King Thrushbeard.
When the King heard him he said , `` Let him come up"
When they came to a large forest she asked , `` To whom does that beautiful forest belong ?"
`` It belongs to King Thrushbeard ; if you had taken him , it would have been yours"
`` Ah , unhappy girl that I am , if I had but taken King Thrushbeard !"
`` It belongs to King Thrushbeard ; if you had taken him , it would have been yours"
`` Ah , unhappy girl that I am , if I had but taken King Thrushbeard !"
`` It belongs to King Thrushbeard ; if you had taken him , it would have been yours"
`` Ah , unhappy girl that I am , if I had but taken King Thrushbeard !"
`` It does not please me ,"
The fiddler answered , `` That is my house and yours , where we shall live together"
She had to stoop in order to go in at the low door.
`` Where are the servants ?"
said the King 's daughter.
`` What servants ?"
answered the beggar-man ; `` you must yourself do what you wish to have done.
You weave baskets"
He went out , cut some willows , and brought them home.
Then she began to weave , but the tough willows wounded her delicate hands.
`` I see that this will not do ,"
said the man ; `` you had better spin , perhaps you can do that better"
`` See ,"
`` Alas ,"
But it was of no use , she had to yield unless she chose to die of hunger.
She began to weep , and did now know what to do for fear.
`` Alas ! what will happen to me ?"
cried she ; `` what will my husband say to this ?"
She ran home and told him of the misfortune.
`` Who would seat herself at a corner of the market-place with crockery ?"
I wish you and I had been there too"
ONCE upon a time there was a frog called person_0.
THE water was all slippy - sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.
But person_0.
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
`` If I catch more than five fish , I will invite my friends person_0.
Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton.
The Alderman , however , eats salad"
MR.
THE boat was round and green , and very like the other lily-leaves.
It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.
MR.
JEREMY took a reed pole , and pushed the boat out into open water.
`` I know a good place for minnows ,"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
MR.
JEREMY stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it.
Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle.
He had the dearest little red float.
THE rain trickled down his back , and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.
`` This is getting tiresome , I think I should like some lunch ,"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
`` I will eat a butterfly sandwich , and wait till the shower is over ,"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
person_0.
Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter , out of reach , and went on eating his sandwich.
`` I trust that is not a rat ,"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1 ; `` I think I had better get away from here"
MR.
JEREMY shoved the boat out again a little way , and dropped in the bait.
cried person_0.
Jeremy person_1 , jerking up his rod.
BUT what a horrible surprise ! Instead of a smooth fat minnow , person_0.
Then he jumped back into the water.
AND a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out , and laughed at person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
AND while person_0.
Jeremy with a snap , `` Ow ! Ow ! Ow !"
Jeremy 's goloshes.
MR.
`` WHAT a mercy that was not a pike !"
said person_0.
Jeremy person_1.
HE put some sticking plaster on his fingers , and his friends both came to dinner.
He could not offer them fish , but he had something else in his larder.
SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat , AND person_0.
Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.
Once upon a time , a tiger was caught in a trap.
By chance a poor person_0 came by.
`` Let me out of this cage , oh pious one !"
cried the tiger.
`` Nay , my friend ,"
replied the person_0 mildly , `` you would probably eat me if I did"
`` Not at all !"
The person_0 , still more sad , asked the road to give him its opinion.
`` My dear sir ,"
person_0 ? You look as miserable as a fish out of water !"
The person_0 told him all that had occurred.
`` How very confusing !"
`` It 's very odd ,"
`` You 've been away a long time !"
growled the savage beast , `` but now let us begin our dinner"
_ Our _ dinner !"
`` Give me five minutes , my lord !"
`` Oh , my poor brain ! oh , my poor brain !"
cried the jackal , wringing its paws.
`` Pooh !"
interrupted the tiger , `` what a fool you are ! _ I _ was in the cage"
`` Of course !"
`` Yes , you shall !"
`` Yes , my lord !"
`` And that is the person_0 --"
`` Yes , my lord !"
`` And that is the cage --"
`` Yes , my lord !"
`` And I was in the cage -- do you understand ?"
`` Yes -- no -- Please , my lord --"
`` Well ?"
cried the tiger impatiently.
`` Please , my lord ! -- how did you get in ?"
`` How ! -- why in the usual way , of course !"
`` Perfectly !"
There were two Cocks -- one on the dunghill , the other on the roof.
`` That 's a privilege of birth ,"
the Cucumber said to herself.
`` Not all can be born cucumbers ; there must be other kinds too.
The fowls , the ducks , and all the cattle in the neighbouring yard are creatures too.
I now look up to the Yard Cock on the partition.
said the Cucumber.
In the night the weather became very bad.
Hens , chickens , and even the Cock himself sought shelter.
He had been `` born old ,"
He despised those , considering them piping birds of trifling stature -- ordinary song birds.
`` Moreover , they are tedious things to converse with ,"
said the Weathercock.
`` They are tedious , and all is tedious ,"
he said.
`` No one is fit to associate with , and one and all of them are wearisome and stupid"
`` The world is worth nothing ,"
he cried.
`` The whole thing is a stupidity"
The Weathercock was what is called `` used up ;"
The wind had blown down the plank , but the storm had passed over.
-LRB- Illustration : THE WEATHERCOCK.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` What do you think of _ that _ crowing ?"
the Yard Cock inquired of his hens and chickens.
`` It was a little rough -- the elegance was wanting"
`` Garden plant !"
`` Cock-a-doodle-doo !"
he crowed.
`` The chickens will grow up large fowls if I make a noise in the poultry-yard of the world"
No one can stand the sight of a basilisk.
`` It 's all stupid stuff !"
said a voice within the Weathercock.
`` The Yard Cock does not lay eggs , and I am too lazy to lay any.
And now I do n't like even to sit here any longer"
The French call this floweret `` Marguerite ,"
`` Heartily ? Painfully ? Loves me much ? A little ? Not at all ?"
and so on.
Every one asks in his own language.
`` Darling Marguerite daisy !"
he said to her , `` you are the wisest woman among the flowers.
But Marguerite did not answer him.
She was angry that he had called her a `` woman ,"
when she was yet a girl ; and there is a great difference.
It was in the beginning of spring ; the crocus and the snowdrop were blooming around.
`` They are very pretty ,"
thought the person_0.
`` Charming little lasses , but a little too much of the schoolgirl about them"
Like all young lads , he looked out for the elder girls.
Then he flew of to the anemones.
`` Who is that ?"
he asked.
`` That is my sister ,"
replied the Pease Blossom.
`` Oh , indeed ; and you will get to look like her !"
he said.
And away he flew , for he felt quite shocked.
No , he did not like her.
`` I shall take her ,"
said the person_0.
And he made an offer for her.
But the mint stood silent and stiff , listening to him.
At last she said , `` Friendship , if you please ; but nothing more.
And thus it happened that the person_0 had no wife at all.
He had been too long choosing , and that is a bad plan.
So the person_0 became what we call an old bachelor.
It was late in autumn , with rain and cloudy weather.
One must have freedom , sunshine , and a little flower"
`` Now I am perched on a stalk , like the flowers ,"
said the person_0.
`` It certainly is not very pleasant.
It must be something like being married , for one is stuck fast"
And he consoled himself in some measure with the thought.
`` That 's very poor comfort ,"
said the potted Plants in the room.
`` But ,"
thought the person_0 , `` one can not well trust these potted Plants.
They 've had too much to do with mankind"
The maxim 's good , and with it I agree : My motto ever is -- VARIETY.
I have howe'er experienced other flame ; The fault 's acknowledged : I confess my shame.
Still harder thirty pounds to pay appeared ; Uncertain how to act , he hanging feared.
UPON a dish my lord the number told ; Clod no way liked the garlick to behold.
`` I have no money ,"
`` I know already what thou art in need of ,"
`` A soldier and fear -- how can those two things go together ?"
he answered ; `` thou canst put me to the proof"
`` Very well , then ,"
answered the man , `` look behind thee"
The soldier turned round , and saw a large bear , which came growling towards him.
`` Oho !"
`` I see quite well ,"
`` If it does not endanger my salvation ,"
replied the soldier , who knew very well who was standing by him.
`` If it does , I 'll have nothing to do with it"
`` Thou wilt look to that for thyself ,"
I will give thee a coat and a cloak , which during this time thou must wear.
After this the Devil vanished.
Bearskin went nearer , but the man sprang to his feet and tried to escape from him.
`` If that is your only trouble ,"
said Bearskin , `` I have plenty of money"
`` Come with me ,"
When she hears what thou hast done for me , she will not refuse thee.
Thou dost in truth look a little strange , but she will soon put thee to rights again"
This pleased Bearskin well , and he went.
If it were nothing but ugliness , I might get used to that"
But pray to God to preserve my life"
Nothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters.
`` Take care ,"
said the eldest , `` if thou givest him thy hand , he will strike his claws into it"
`` Beware !"
said the second.
`` Thou must always do as he likes ,"
began the elder again , `` or else he will growl"
And the second continued , `` But the wedding will be a merry one , for bears dance well"
The bride was silent , and did not let them vex her.
`` We have not got so far as that yet ,"
answered Bearskin , `` thou must first make me clean"
When the Devil had gone away , Bearskin was quite lighthearted.
He went up to her , embraced her , and gave her a kiss.
One of them drowned herself in the well , the other hanged herself on a tree.
But Cupid drew her thoughts to higher things , Than merely graving what from fancy springs.
BY one of early years the troop was led , A handsome lad , and elegantly bred.
He landed with his party near the park.
And these in two divided ere 'twas dark.
-- The princess of his folly made a jest.
He fasted one whole day ; she-tried in vain To make him from the enterprise refrain.
No folly greater than to heighten pain , When we are sensible relief is vain.
Another thing , howe'er : -- I wish to hang The pirate instantly , before his gang.
THIS speech so well succeeded to inspire , That scarcely could the men retain their ire.
SHE followed his advice : avenged the wrong ; And naught omitted , pleasures to prolong.
If he obtained his wishes from the fair , The host about it scarcely seemed to care.
THE lover , now convinced that he was feared ; In dark designs upon her persevered.
I 'll freely say , howe'er , that I regard , My services enough to claim reward.
THE treaty was most faithfully observed ; No calculation wrong ; from naught they swerved.
SWEET , charming FAIR , your characters revere ; The Mamolin 's a bird not common here.
YOUR friendships may be very chaste and pure , But strangely Cupid 's lessons will allure.
Defeat his wiles ; resist his tempting charms E ` en from suspicion suffer not alarms.
`` That was a remarkably fine dinner yesterday ,"
observed an old person_0 of the female sex to another who had not been at the festive gathering.
There was as much joviality and agreeable jesting as in the family circle.
Nothing was left but the pegs at the ends of the sausages.
`` That was not at all bad ,"
said the other person_0 ; `` but how does one prepare this soup ?"
But every one has not the gift of leaving the family circle and the chimney corner.
In foreign parts one ca n't get cheese-rinds and bacon every day.
No , one must bear hunger , and perhaps be eaten up alive by a cat"
Only four mice announced themselves ready to depart.
They were young and brisk , but poor.
Every one took a sausage-peg , so as to keep in mind the object of the journey.
The stiff sausage-peg was to be to them as a pilgrim 's staff.
`` Yes , there 's always some drawback in even the pleasantest affair ,"
said the person_0 King.
And then he gave orders that all mice within a circuit of many miles should be invited.
And now let us hear.
_ What the first little person_0 had seen and learned in her travels.
_ `` When I went out into the wide world ,"
Years must pass before one gets so far.
I went to sea at once.
I went in a ship that steered towards the north.
There were great lakes there too.
I kept with my own kind.
`` All at once , the most charming little people came marching forth.
They were only tall enough to reach to my knee.
` I will lend it , ' I said , ` but not to keep.
'"
And now came the real great party of elves.
I was quite touched.
I wept , as a little mouse may weep , with pure pleasure.
` Why , you have just seen it.
I fancy you hardly knew your sausage-peg again ? '"
` You only mean that as a joke ,"
I replied.
That would be a dish that could only be put on the table when the guests had dined.
' -LRB- Illustration : THE ELVES APPLY FOR THE LOAN OF THE SAUSAGE-PEG.
But before the little person_0 said what this `` something more"
`` But what was the ` something more , ' of which you spoke ?"
asked the person_0 King.
`` Why ,"
the little person_0 answered , `` I think it is what they call effect !"
Therefore it yet remains to provide for hearing and taste ! '"
Oh ! it became so terrible , that the little person_0 lost her stick at last.
`` That was a heavy soup !"
said the person_0 King.
`` Shall we not soon hear about the preparation ?"
`` That was all ,"
said the little person_0 , with a bow.
`` That is all ! Then we should be glad to hear what the next has to relate ,"
said the person_0 King.
_ What the second little person_0 had to tell.
_ `` I was born in the palace library ,"
said the second person_0.
' She asked me if I were a poet.
`` Understanding is the most important thing in every affair.
`` The ants are a respectable people.
They are understanding itself.
Everything with them is like a well-worked sum , that comes right.
They were divided into the clean and the dirty ants.
I saw ,"
I could not be mistaken , and I ate her up.
She uttered a piercing cry when she saw me so near.
I accosted the maiden in a friendly and honest way , and bade her take courage.
said the little person_0.
`` I put it in water , and held it there till it grew soft.
It was very hard to digest , but I nibbled it up at last.
I said so to myself , and told the others also.
I had headache , and chestache , and I ca n't tell what aches besides.
`` Let us hear what the third has to say ,"
was now the person_0 King 's command.
`` Peep ! peep !"
She toppled the sausage-peg with the crape covering over in a moment.
And let us hear what she said.
-LRB- Illustration : THE GAOLER 'S GRANDDAUGHTER TAKES PITY ON THE LITTLE MOUSE.
_ `` I betook myself immediately to the largest town ,"
she said ; `` the name has escaped me -- I have a bad memory for names.
The gaoler was talking of his prisoners , and especially of one who had spoken unconsidered words.
These words had given rise to others , and these latter had been written down and recorded"
' `` Now , this gave me an interest in the prisoner ,"
The prisoner looked pale , and had a great beard , and bright sparkling eyes.
I think he found it tedious , and I was a welcome guest.
I really got to love him , for these things are reciprocal.
_ I _ stayed , but _ he _ did not stay.
I do n't know his history"
`` It was dark , and night was coming on.
I took up my quarters in an old tower , where dwelt a watchman and an owl.
That is a creature like a cat , who has the great failing that she eats mice.
'"
` Nothing ! '"
I exclaimed.
`` I was quite struck.
The mice are an enlightened people , and the king is above them all.
He is capable of making me queen , for the sake of truth"
`` Your truth is a falsehood ,"
said the person_0 who had not yet spoken.
`` I can prepare the soup , and I mean to prepare it"
_ How it was prepared.
_ `` I did not travel ,"
the third person_0 said.
`` I remained in my country -- that 's the right thing to do.
There 's no necessity for traveling ; one can get everything as good here.
I stayed at home.
I have what I know through my own reflections.
It costs nothing at all -- no further materials are necessary , only stir it round !"
`` Can not any one else do that ?"
asked the person_0 King.
`` No ;"
replied the mouse.
`` The power is contained only in the tail of the person_0 King"
`` Of course -- certainly you are my queen ,"
he said.
-LRB- Illustration : THE MOUSE KING UNDERSTANDS HOW THE SOUP IS MADE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa And soon the wedding was held.
_ I _ should have told it so -- and so -- and so !"
Thus said the critics , who are always wise -- after the fact.
Everything was like a wide , blooming meadow , or like the most charming garden.
Each tower was reared in the form of a lily.
Here , on the walls , the whole world around was reflected.
He also , however high he might tower above men in wisdom , must die one day.
`` What happens to man ?"
Thither ?"
The wiser a man becomes , the more he will read ; and the wisest read most.
But in the division of the book whose title is `` Life after Death"
not even one point was to be distinctly seen.
That pained him.
But that made him none the wiser.
The Book of Truth lay before him with leaves that appeared blank.
existed.
Five senses have been given corporeally and mentally , inwardly and outwardly , to body and soul.
The children reflected deeply upon these things ; they meditated upon them by day and by night.
Then the eldest of the brothers dreamt a splendid dream.
But the sister dreamt nothing about going out into the wide world.
It never entered her mind.
Her world was her father 's house.
`` I shall ride forth into the wide world ,"
said the eldest brother.
`` I must try what life is like there , and go to and fro among men.
I will practice only the good and the true ; with these I will protect the beautiful.
Much shall change for the better when I am there"
In the case of the eldest this pre-eminent sense was Sight.
This was to do him especial service.
He followed them.
It was the same thing everywhere.
`` I see I must attack these things vigorously ,"
he said ; and attacked them with vigor accordingly.
`` Over !"
said the wild swan , who flew across the sea towards the east.
`` Over !"
twittered the swallows , who likewise flew eastward , towards the Tree of the Sun.
That was no good news that they carried to the young man 's home.
`` I fancy the _ Seer _ must have fared badly ,"
said the second brother ; `` but the _ Hearer _ may have better fortune"
But he experienced the fact that one may have too much of a good thing.
His hearing was _ too _ fine.
and all the turret clocks striking `` ding dong !"
It was unbearable.
_ I _ will try now !"
said the third brother.
`` I have a sharp _ nose _ !"
`` I can smell fire !"
`` Every fragrant spot in the realm of the beautiful has its frequenters ,"
he said.
Another prefers sitting among the overpowering scent of jessamine , or scenting himself with strong clove oil.
Thus he spake.
`` I will give my seal to the flower ,"
said the Snail ; `` I have spit at it , and I can do no more for it"
`` Thus it always fares with the beautiful in this world !"
Then the poet sang several songs of the beautiful , the true , and the good.
It appeared as if this brother was to have better fortune than the two others.
The black wood-snail became blacker still , not for grief , but for envy.
`` They should have strewed incense for me ,"
That 's the usual way ! -LRB- Illustration : THE DEPARTURE OF THE THIRD BROTHER.
said the fourth brother.
Those two had filled the castle with cheerfulness , and now the last cheerfulness was going away.
`` That was no delicacy ,"
he said , and he wanted to go out and try what was delicate.
`` Perhaps fortune may be more favourable to me than it was to my brothers ,"
he said.
`` I shall start on my travels.
But what conveyance shall I choose ? Are air balloons invented yet ?"
But air balloons had not yet been invented , nor steam ships , nor railways.
`` Good : then I shall choose an air balloon ,"
he said ; `` my father knows how they are made and guided.
And he obtained what he wanted , and flew away.
The birds accompanied him farther than they had flown with the other brothers.
Now he was out in the wide world.
Then he sat on the church steeple.
All the chimneys in the town were smoking merrily.
`` Those are altars erected to thy honor !"
said the Wind , who wished to say something agreeable to him.
He sat boldly up there , and looked down upon the people in the street.
`` Vanity ! I must hasten downward , dip my finger in the pot , and taste !"
he said.
I 'll sit here so long as the wind blows.
I 'll enjoy a slight rest.
I 'll stop here so long as this wind blows , for it pleases me"
`` It goes not well with them ,"
With kindly longing she thought of her brothers.
She had wetted them with her tears , and the twist was strong as a cable.
She rose , and her resolution was taken : the dream must be made a reality.
It was night , and her father slept.
She possessed a gift which all the others lacked.
Into the innermost depths of her heart penetrated the echoes of human thoughts and feelings.
-LRB- Illustration : THE BLIND GIRL 'S MESSENGERS.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa But the evil spirit could not see this and be content.
sung the blind girl , in full faith.
From the forehead of humanity it would gleam even to the castle of her father.
`` Even to my father 's house ,"
she repeated.
I feel its glow , it swells more and more in my closed hand.
I have my whole hand full of it"
And she stretched forth her hand towards her father.
`` It will be blown away by the wind !"
said the father , and he seized the hand she had opened.
`` No ,"
And with the father and daughter were again the four brothers.
They had arrived.
Thus , from the leaf of the book with the beaming word"
_ Believe _ ,"
_ Believe _"
Now , Farmer person_0 and his hired man had not chopped long before they stopped to breathe.
The tree no longer shook.
And Fatty felt better at once.
But they had no such idea at all.
`` Which way are you going to fell her ?"
the hired man asked.
He said HER , meaning the TREE , of course.
`` That way !"
said Farmer person_0 , pointing toward the woods.
`` But will she clear the trees on the edge of the woods ?"
The hired man appeared somewhat doubtful.
`` Oh , to be sure -- to be sure !"
answered Farmer person_0.
And with that they set to work again.
Yes ! it began to lean toward the woods.
Slowly , slowly it tipped.
And Fatty was scared half out of his mind.
And there he waited.
There was nothing else he could do.
What was going to happen to him then ? Fatty wondered.
And while he was wondering there sounded all at once a great snapping and splitting.
And Fatty felt the tree falling , falling.
He could hear Johnnie person_0 shouting.
And he shut his eyes and held fast to his branch.
Then came the crash.
When Fatty Coon opened his eyes he expected to see Johnnie person_0 all ready to seize him.
But to his great surprise he was still far above the ground.
You see , Farmer person_0 had been mistaken.
It was no wonder that Johnnie person_0 shouted.
Fatty was going straight into the woods.
It was no wonder that Johnnie person_0 shouted.
For he had lost his pet coon.
He had lost him before he ever had him.
And he was sadly disappointed.
And he was very glad -- you may be sure -- to get safely home once more"
Then said the Jew , `` Grant me my life , I have no money but eight farthings"
But the tailor said , `` Money thou hast ; and it shall be produced ,"
and used violence and beat him until he was near death.
and thereupon he died.
The woman said , `` Oh , dear husband , and what is that , then ?"
`` What dost thou mean by that ?"
He answered , `` I must not tell thee"
But she said , `` If thou lovest me , thou must tell me ,"
And thus , after all , the bright sun did bring it to light"
They had finished their evening meal at person_1 's house.
And person_1 looked up at the moon , rising from behind Blue Mountain.
`` We 'll go coon-hunting again to-night ,"
he said to Johnnie and the hired man.
`` The corn has brought the coons up from the swamp.
We 'll start as soon as it grows a little darker"
Well -- after a while they set out for the cornfield.
And sure enough ! old Spot soon began to bark.
`` He 's treed !"
said person_1 , pretty soon.
In the moonlight they could see the coon quite plainly.
`` Another little feller !"
cried person_1.
`` I declare , all the coons that come to the cornfield seem to be young ones.
This one 's no bigger than the one we saw last night"
But there were no trees near enough the big chestnut for that.
Fatty had to stay right there and wait for those men to pass on.
He was n't afraid.
He felt perfectly safe in his big tree.
He 'd make a fine pet"
`` A pet !"
exclaimed person_1.
`` You remember that pet fox you had , that stole my chickens ?"
`` Oh , I 'd be careful ,"
Johnnie promised.
person_1 smiled.
`` All right !"
he said at last.
`` I 'll give you one more chance , Johnnie.
But you 'll have to see that this young coon does n't kill any of my poultry"
Johnnie promised that nothing of the sort should happen.
He , too , shivered and shook.
And he wrapped himself all the way around a limb and hung on as tight as ever he could"
The day being unusually hot , person_0 thought it best to encamp there.
On the eleventh day the bird continued flying , and came near a great city.
Come in and rest.
They took the Isle of Ebony on their way to the Isles of the Children of Khaledan.
He showed her all possible honor , and entertained her for three days with extraordinary magnificence.
She talked also to her women , and charged them to continue to keep the secret.
I only ask of you at present to be your friend.
Their shows are worth seeing.
You will have nothing to do to-day : I leave you here.
' The gardener put on his best clothes , and went out.
They killed the murderer with their beaks.
person_0 remained in great astonishment all the time that he stood beholding this sight.
The good man bade him root up an old tree which bore no fruit.
person_0 took an axe , and began his work.
' Prince person_0 would not be outdone in generosity by the gardener.
They had a long dispute about it.
The gardener was equally surprised and joyful to hear it for his sake.
They asked him where the passenger was that was to go with him.
I will only take leave of the gardener , and follow you.
The princess demanded how much the fifty pots might be worth in the Isle of Ebony.
Great was her astonishment when she found the olives mingled with gold-dust.
` What can this mean ? ' said she , ` it is wonderful beyond comprehension.
The person_1 Haiatalnefous and her women restored the person_1 Badoura by throwing cold water on her face.
He showed me the place , and for that reason I told your majesty he was poor.
I went there to call him.
They were so diligent , that he set sail the same day.
Though it was about midnight when he arrived there , the prince was not asleep.
His separation from the fair person_1 of China his wife afflicted him as usual.
He cursed the minute in which his curiosity tempted him to touch the fatal girdle.
He was much more surprised when he heard him praise him so excessively.
Then the steward of his household brought him a strong box full of gold for his expenses.
She was now known only by the name of the young King Armanos.
She herself also lived under such constraint that she could endure it no longer.
' person_0 took the talisman , and drew near a lamp to look at it.
He sat down and asked where the king was.
' person_0 was proclaimed king , and married the same day with all possible demonstrations of joy.
And that seemed best to the others also.
They went forth , and met on the way a richly-dressed man who asked who they were.
`` There is no need for that ,"
`` They will not ,"
replied the man , `` I have no claim on you"
As they were now secure , they consented , and the Devil told them what he wanted.
The first was to answer , `` All three of us ,"
to every question ; the second was to say , `` For money ,"
and the third , `` And quite right too !"
`` Yes ,"
said the host , `` that is what I mean"
The second said , `` For money"
`` Of course ,"
said the host.
The third said , `` And quite right too !"
`` Certainly it is right ,"
said the host.
Good meat and drink were now brought to them , and they were well waited on.
the second said , `` For money ,"
and the third , `` and quite right too !"
`` Indeed it is right ,"
said the host , `` all three pay , and without money I can give nothing"
They , however , paid still more than he had asked.
The lodgers , who were looking on , said , `` These people must be mad"
`` Yes , indeed they are ,"
said the host , `` they are not very wise"
`` For money ,"
and `` And quite right too !"
But they saw and knew all that was going on.
The host did as he was asked.
the lodgers confirmed it , and said , `` It can have been no one else"
`` All three of us ,"
said the first , `` For money ,"
said the second ; and the third added , `` And quite right too !"
`` There now , you hear ,"
said the host , `` they confess it themselves"
They were taken to prison , therefore , and were to be tried.
`` All three of us"
`` Why did you kill the merchant ?"
`` For money"
`` You wicked wretches , you have no horror of your sins ?"
`` And quite right too !"
`` They have confessed , and are still stubborn ,"
said the judge , `` lead them to death instantly"
So they were taken out , and the host had to go with them into the circle.
Then said the headsman , `` It is a pardon coming ,"
and `` Pardon ! pardon !"
was called from the carriage also.
and he pointed to the innkeeper.
`` If you will serve me for seven years ,"
said the dragon , `` I will convey you through the army so that no one shall seize you"
`` We have no choice and are compelled to accept ,"
they replied.
Then he put before them a book which they were all three forced to sign.
`` I will , however , then set you a riddle ,"
They went out into the open country and sat down , and the two pulled sorrowful faces.
Then an aged woman came up to them who inquired why they were so sad ? `` Alas !"
said they , `` how can that concern you ? After all , you can not help us"
`` Who knows ?"
said she.
`` Confide your trouble to me"
The two melancholy ones thought to themselves , `` That will still not save us ,"
At twelve o'clock at night , the dragon came flying thither , and asked for his dinner.
he answered , `` but I have laid hold of three soldiers , I have them safe"
`` Indeed ! three soldiers , that 's something like , but they may escape you yet"
`` What riddle is that ?"
she inquired.
`` I will tell you.
`` Hast thou paid particular attention to everything ?"
`` Yes ,"
said he , `` I know enough , and will contrive to save myself"
The Devil was angry , and began to mutter , `` Hm ! hm ! hm !"
And asked the second , `` But what will your spoon be ?"
`` The rib of a whale , that is to be our silver spoon"
The Devil made a wry face , again growled , `` Hm ! hm ! hm !"
and said to the third , `` And do you also know what your wine-glass is to be ?"
`` An old horse 's hoof is to be our wineglass"
One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food.
Then the old one bleated , and went on her way with an easy mind.
cried they , `` thou art not our mother.
She has a soft , pleasant voice , but thy voice is rough ; thou art the wolf !"
The miller thought to himself , `` The wolf wants to deceive someone ,"
Then the miller was afraid , and made his paws white for him.
Truly men are like that.
But who should come in but the wolf ! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.
The youngest , who was in the clock-case , was the only one he did not find.
Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest.
Ah ! What a sight she saw there ! The house-door stood wide open.
She sought her children , but they were nowhere to be found.
She called them one after another by name , but no one answered.
Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.
At length in her grief she went out , and the youngest kid ran with her.
`` Ah , heavens ,"
and danced for joy round about the well with their mother"
`` Thunder and lightning ,"
cried the tailor , `` what is that ?"
and as he was strongly goaded by curiosity , he went boldly towards it.
`` What dost thou want here , thou tiny fly 's leg ?"
cried the giant , with a voice as if it were thundering on every side.
`` If that is what thou art after ,"
said the giant , `` thou mayst have a place with me"
`` If it must be , why not ? What wages shall I receive ?"
`` Thou shalt hear what wages thou shalt have.
Does that suit thee ?"
`` All right ,"
`` Had I not better bring the well itself at once , and the spring too ?"
asked the boaster , and went with the pitcher to the water.
`` What ! the well and the spring too ,"
`` That knave is not a fool , he has a wizard in his body.
Be on thy guard , old Hans , this is no serving-man for thee"
`` Why not the whole forest , at once , with one stroke.
The whole forest , young and old , with all that is there , both rough and smooth ?"
asked the little tailor , and went to cut the wood.
growled the credulous giant in his beard , and was still more terrified.
Be on thy guard , old Hans , this is no serving-man for thee !"
`` Why not rather a thousand at one shot , and bring them all here ?"
inquired the ostentatious tailor.
`` What !"
cried the timid giant in great terror ; `` Let well alone to-night , and lie down to rest"
Time brings counsel.
If the tailor has not fallen down again , he must be hovering about in the air"
He had dug some holes in the garden , and now wanted to plant some trees in them.
`` Have you no children ,"
asked the stranger , `` who could help you with your work ?"
`` No ,"
`` But tell me ,"
That tree there is old , and mis-shapen , no one can make it straight now.
Trees must be trained while they are young"
`` That is how it was with your son ,"
`` Truly it is a long time since he went away ,"
replied the old man , `` he must have changed"
`` Would you know him again if he were to come to you ?"
asked the stranger.
`` Hardly by his face ,"
`` Good God !"
cried the old man , `` Thou art really my son !"
and love for his child stirred in his heart.
`` But ,"
`` Ah , father ,"
For me there are neither locks nor bolts , whatsoever I desire is mine.
Poor people are safe , I would rather give to them than take anything from them.
`` Alas , my son ,"
`` Be easy , father , he will do me no harm , for I understand my trade.
I will go to him myself this very day"
When evening drew near , the master-thief seated himself in his carriage , and drove to the castle.
The count received him civilly , for he took him for a distinguished man.
`` Lord count ,"
Mark what I am saying , for thy life depends on it"
Then he filled a small cask with old Hungary wine in which was mixed a powerful sleeping-drink.
It was already dark when he arrived.
`` What hast thou got in thy little cask , old lady ?"
asked one.
`` A good mouthful of wine ,"
she answered.
`` Let us have it here , then ,"
and had another poured out for himself , and the rest followed his example.
`` Hallo , comrades ,"
The old woman carried her cask into the stable.
She poured out as much as they wanted until the spring ran dry.
When day broke , the master galloped to the castle on the stolen horse.
The count had just got up , and was looking out of the window.
`` Good morning , Sir Count ,"
`` Now ,"
thought the thief , `` the favourable moment has come ,"
stole nimbly out of his corner , and climbed up the ladder straight into the countess 's bedroom.
`` Dear wife ,"
I will not put him to open shame ; besides , I am sorry for the parents.
The countess gave him the sheet.
`` I tell you what ,"
`` Art thou a wizard ?"
`` You did not bury me ,"
said the thief , `` but the poor sinner on the gallows ,"
`` But thou hast not reached the end yet ,"
The master smiled and returned no answer.
In the sack he had some crabs , and in the bundle short wax-candles.
I am Peter , who opens and shuts the gate of heaven.
Behold how the dead outside there in the churchyard , are wandering about collecting their bones.
Come , come , and creep into the sack ; the world is about to be destroyed !"
The cry echoed through the whole village.
`` To tell the truth ,"
`` Yes ,"
answered the clerk , `` but you , the pastor , have the precedence , I will follow"
So the parson went first , and ascended the pulpit where the master opened his sack.
The parson crept in first , and then the clerk.
Then he bolted the door upon them , and went away.
`` Where hast thou left them ?"
asked the lord.
`` They are lying upstairs in a sack in the pigeon-house , and imagine that they are in heaven"
The count went up himself , and convinced himself that the master had told the truth.
Long , long ago in Japan there lived an old man and his wife.
She was always grumbling about something from morning to night.
The old man had for a long time ceased to take any notice of her crossness.
He loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child.
If I have made a mistake I beg you to forgive me ! tweet , tweet , tweet !"
But not so.
Now she was only too delighted to have some cause of complaint against the pet.
In the evening the old man came home.
Still no sparrow was to be seen.
So he called her and said anxiously : `` Where is Suzume San -LRB- Miss Sparrow -RRB- today ?"
Now I come to think of it , I have n't seen her all the afternoon.
`` How could you be so cruel ? Oh ! how could you so cruel ?"
was all that the old man could answer.
`` What a dreadful misfortune for my poor Suzume San to lose her tongue !"
he said to himself.
The old man shed many tears after his cross wife had gone to sleep.
Having decided this he was able to go to sleep at last.
He could hardly believe his eyes for joy , and ran forward quickly to greet her.
Then the old man knew that his sparrow was a fairy , and no common bird.
It would be difficult to exaggerate the old man 's rejoicing now.
And above all she was a fairy.
-RRB- of every room.
or the `` Sparrow 's dance ,"
to amuse the guest.
Never had the old man enjoyed himself so much.
Now he knew that all was well he could return home with a light heart.
she asked in a big voice.
`` Why do you come back so late ?"
`` Now let us see what is in the box ,"
said the old man , not giving her time to grumble again.
`` You must help me open it"
And they both sat down before the box and opened it.
The old man was overjoyed at the sight of the riches that were now his.
He said : `` Thanks to my good little sparrow ! Thanks to my good little sparrow !"
many times.
`` You silly old man ,"
We might have had twice as much silver and gold as this.
You are certainly an old fool !"
she screamed , and then went to bed as angry as she could be.
She would not listen to one word he said.
But her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else.
`` How could she ,"
They had not long to wait.
At last she saw the eaves of the house peeping out from amongst the bamboo foliage.
She hastened to the door and knocked loudly.
I have come myself to get the box which he so stupidly left behind.
The Lady Sparrow at once consented , and told her servants to bring out the big box.
What she saw , however , so terrified her that she nearly lost her senses.
I only hope this may be a lesson to you in the future !"
The mayor stood at the open window.
`` Hark ` ee , youngster !"
he cried.
`` You 're a good boy ,"
said Mr.
Mayor.
`` You 're a civil boy.
How much have you got in it ?"
`` Half a quartern ,"
stammered the boy , in a frightened voice.
`` And this morning she had just as much ,"
the mayor continued.
`` No ,"
replied the boy , `` it was yesterday"
`` Two halves make a whole.
Poor child -- there , go !"
Accordingly the boy went on his way.
The washerwoman was obliged to lean against the bench , to support it.
`` I was very nearly sailing away ,"
she said.
For six hours I 've been standing in the water.
Have you brought anything for me ?"
`` Ah , how that revives one !"
And you , my boy ! you look quite pale.
You are shivering in your thin clothes -- to be sure it is autumn.
Ugh ! how cold the water is ! I hope I shall not be ill.
.
And she stepped up to the bridge on which the boy stood , and came ashore.
The water dripped from the straw matting she had wound round her , and from her gown.
`` I work and toil as much as ever I can ,"
As she spoke , a somewhat older woman came towards them.
The curl was intended to cover the eye , but it only made the defect more striking.
This was a friend of the laundress.
She was called among the neighbors , `` Lame person_0 with the curl"
`` Oh , you poor thing ! How you work , standing there in the water !"
cried the visitor.
`` A good many will take more than they need -- but that 's not called drinking.
_ They _ are good ; but _ you _ are good for nothing !"
cried person_0 , indignantly.
`` Ah , so he spoke to you , my child ?"
said the washerwoman ; and her lips trembled as she spoke.
Still , I have had much misfortune from that house"
and person_0 smiled.
`` The mayor has a great dinner party to-day.
The footman told me about it.
A letter came a little while ago , to say that the younger brother had died in Copenhagen"
`` Died !"
repeated the laundress -- and she became pale as death.
`` Yes , certainly ,"
said person_0.
And the tears rolled down her cheeks.
`` Good heavens ! everything is whirling around me -- it was too much for me.
I feel quite ill"
And she leaned against the plank.
`` Good heavens , you are ill indeed !"
exclaimed the other woman.
`` Come , come , it will pass over presently.
But no , you really look seriously ill.
.
The best thing will be for me to lead you home"
`` But my linen yonder --"
`` I will take care of that.
Come , give me your arm.
The laundress 's limbs shook under her.
`` I have stood too long in the cold water ,"
she said faintly , `` and I have eaten and drunk nothing since this morning.
The fever is in my bones.
O kind Heaven , help me to get home ! My poor child !"
and she burst into tears.
The two women could make only slow progress.
Many people assembled round her , and Lame person_0 ran into the house to get help.
The mayor and his guests came to the window.
`` That 's the washerwoman !"
he said.
`` She has taken a glass too much.
She is good for nothing.
It 's a pity for the pretty son she has.
I really like the child very well ; but the mother is good for nothing"
Towards evening she was sitting in the poor little room with the laundress.
Soon the patient felt a little better.
The warm beer had strengthened her , and the fragrance of the provisions pleased her also.
`` Thanks , you kind soul ,"
she said to person_0.
`` I will tell you all when the boy is asleep.
I think he has dropped off already.
How gentle and good he looks , as he lies there with his eyes closed.
I was in service at the councillor 's , the father of the mayor.
It happened that the youngest of the sons , the student , came home.
The student was merry and kind , good and brave.
Every drop of blood in him was good and honest.
I have not seen a better man on this earth.
She showed me clearly , in spirit and in truth , the difference there was between him and me"
You have not been educated as he has.
You are not equals in mind , and there is the misfortune.
He is a widower without children , and is well to do.
Think it over.
It was a heavy night that I had to pass through.
It seemed like a Providence , that as I stepped out of church Erich came towards me.
And now there was no longer a doubt in my mind.
` Yes , it will come ! ' he answered ; and upon this we joined hands.
I went home to my mistress.
I wore the gold ring that the son had given me at my heart.
Then my mistress put her arms round me and kissed me.
`` Oh , you were a dear , good mistress ,"
cried person_0.
`` Never shall I forget how kind you and your husband were !"
`` Yes , those were our good years , when you were with us.
We had not any children yet.
The student I never saw again.
-- Yes , though , I saw him , but he did not see me.
He was here at his mother 's funeral.
I saw him stand by the grave.
I know that he never married ; I believe he became a lawyer.
And that is very fortunate"
`` We had five hundred dollars ,"
`` Just at that time my dear sweet boy who is sleeping yonder was born.
We went back more and more , and fell into debt.
All that we had was sold , and my husband died.
But He will take me to Himself in His own good time , and will not forsake my boy"
And she fell asleep.
`` She has drunk herself to death !"
said the mayor.
`` There was some fuss between my brother and her ,"
said the mayor.
He may turn out a reputable working man"
And Heaven gave its blessing to these words.
`` My dear mother !"
he cried , as the tears fell fast.
`` Is it true what they said : that she was good for nothing ?"
`` No , she was good for much !"
replied the old servant , and she looked up indignantly.
`` I knew it many a year ago , and more than all since last night.
'"
The sun shone down , and all the windows were open.
A dead man had been carried out here , and he was to be buried this morning.
With each flower a chapter in his life was associated.
-LRB- Illustration : THE POWER OF THE BOOK.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Who is the dead man ?"
we asked ; and the answer was : `` The Old Student.
She gave it to him , the young lady in the nobleman 's garden.
`` Pee-wit ! pee-wit !"
Now both Sun and Wind were greedy and selfish.
Then Sun -LRB- who was eldest -RRB- said , `` I have brought nothing home for you.
I went out to enjoy myself with my friends -- not to fetch a dinner for my mother !"
And Wind said , `` Neither have I brought anything home for you , mother.
But Moon said , `` Mother , fetch a plate , see what I have brought you"
And shaking her hands she showered down such a choice dinner as never was seen before.
And men shall hate you , and cover their heads when you appear"
-LRB- And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.
And men shall detest and avoid you from this very time"
-LRB- And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable.
No noxious glare shall accompany your pure rays , and men shall always call you ` blessed"
-RRB-"
`` I love the children ,"
said the Moon , `` especially the quite little ones -- they are so droll.
It gives me pleasure to see them dressing and undressing.
`` But about what I was going to tell you.
`` This evening the two elder children were a little boisterous.
She was praying the Lord 's prayer aloud.
But her mother interrupted her in the middle of her prayer.
' The little one lay silent , and looked at her mother in embarrassment.
'"
`` This evening I saw a German play acted ,"
said the Moon.
`` It was in a little town.
ONCE upon a time there was an old cat , called Mrs.
person_2 Twitchit , who was an anxious parent.
She caught Moppet and Mittens , but she could not find person_0.
Mrs.
person_2 went up and down all over the house , mewing for person_0.
She went right upstairs and looked into the attics , but she could not find him anywhere.
It was an old , old house , full of cupboards and passages.
Mrs.
person_2 became more and more distracted , and mewed dreadfully.
While their mother was searching the house , Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.
The cupboard door was not locked , so they pushed it open and came out.
They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.
They patted it with their little soft paws -- `` Shall we make dear little muffins ?"
said Mittens to Moppet.
The visitor was a neighbor , Mrs.
Ribby ; she had called to borrow some yeast.
Mrs.
said person_2 , shedding tears.
`` I 've lost my dear son Thomas ; I 'm afraid the rats have got him"
She wiped her eyes with an apron.
Where have you looked for him ?"
`` All over the house ! The rats are too many for me.
What a thing it is to have an unruly family !"
said Mrs.
person_2 Twitchit.
`` They have both got out of the cup - board !"
Ribby and person_2 set to work to search the house thoroughly again.
They poked under the beds with Ribby 's umbrella , and they rummaged in cupboards.
They even fetched a candle , and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics.
They could not find anything , but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.
`` Yes , it is infested with rats ,"
And once I saw the old father rat -- an enormous old rat , Cousin Ribby.
`` The rats get upon my nerves , Cousin Ribby ,"
said person_2.
Ribby and person_2 searched and searched.
They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor.
But there was nothing to be seen.
They returned to the kitchen.
`` Here 's one of your kittens at least ,"
said Ribby , dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.
They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor.
She seemed to be in a terrible fright.
`` Oh ! Mother , Mother ,"
The two cats ran to look at the dough pan.
But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.
They went into the dairy.
The first thing they found was Mittens , hiding in an empty jar.
They tipped up the jar , and she scrambled out.
`` Oh , Mother , Mother !"
Ribby and person_2 looked at one another.
`` A rolling-pin and butter ! Oh , my poor son Thomas !"
exclaimed person_2 , wringing her paws.
`` A rolling-pin ?"
said Ribby.
`` Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest ?"
Ribby and person_2 rushed upstairs again.
Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.
`` This is serious , Cousin person_2 ,"
said Ribby.
`` We must send for John Joiner at once , with a saw"
person_0 did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.
When he saw that his mother was going to bake , he determined to hide.
He looked about for a nice convenient place , and he fixed upon the chimney.
person_0 got upon the fender and looked up.
It was a big old-fashioned fireplace.
The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about.
So there was plenty of room for a little person_0 Cat.
`` I can not go back.
If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket"
The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one.
It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.
person_0 was getting very frightened ! He climbed up , and up , and up.
Then he waded sideways through inches of soot.
He was like a little sweep himself.
It was most confusing in the dark.
One flue seemed to lead into another.
There was less smoke , but person_0 felt quite lost.
There were some mutton bones lying about -- `` This seems funny ,"
said person_0.
It makes me sneeze ,"
said person_0.
Opposite to him -- as far away as he could sit -- was an enormous rat.
`` What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts ?"
said the rat , chattering his teeth.
`` Please sir , the chimney wants sweeping ,"
said poor person_0.
`` Anna person_3 ! Anna person_3 !"
squeaked the rat.
There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.
Anna person_3 did the tying.
The old rat watched her and took snuff.
When she had finished , they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.
`` Anna person_3 ,"
`` It requires dough and a pat of butter , and a rolling-pin ,"
said Anna person_3 , considering person_0 with her head on one side.
`` No ,"
said Samuel Whiskers , `` make it properly , Anna person_3 , with breadcrumbs"
`` Nonsense ! Butter and dough ,"
replied Anna person_3.
The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.
He did not meet anybody.
He made a second journey for the rolling - pin.
They did not see him.
She borrowed a small saucer , and scooped up the dough with her paws.
She did not observe Moppet.
It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles.
It did not offer to assist him.
person_0 wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.
Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling.
First they smeared him with butter , and then they rolled him in the dough.
`` Will not the string be very indigestible , Anna person_3 ?"
inquired Samuel Whiskers.
She laid hold of his ears.
The rats each held an end.
`` His tail is sticking out ! You did not fetch enough dough , Anna person_3"
`` I fetched as much as I could carry ,"
replied Anna person_3.
`` I do not think"
It smells sooty"
`` I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding"
`` Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane ,"
said Anna person_3.
`` I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney"
The cat family had quite recovered.
They invited him to stay to dinner.
They had been obliged to put person_0 into a hot bath to get the butter off.
They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.
Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath.
Anna person_3 was still arguing in shrill tones.
She seemed to know her way , and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.
After that , there were no more rats for a long time at person_2 Twitchit 's.
As for Farmer Potatoes , he has been driven nearly distracted.
And they are all descended from Mr.
and Mrs.
Samuel Whiskers -- children and grand-children and great great grand-children.
There is no end to them ! Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.
They go out rat-catching in the village , and they find plenty of employment.
They charge so much a dozen , and earn their living very comfortably.
The End"
Their only neighbor was a bad and malicious badger.
Then he laid traps for the wicked animal.
She looked tired and old.
`` Dear lady ,"
`` Thank you for your kindness ,"
You might untie me , for I promise not to try to escape.
I am so tired and sore tied up like this.
If you would only let me down for a few minutes I would indeed be thankful !"
The old woman had a good and simple nature , and could not think badly of any one.
Much less did she think that the badger was only deceiving her in order to get away.
She felt sorry , too , for the animal as she turned to look at him.
Towards sunset he left his work and turned to go home.
I have made the badger soup and have been waiting for you for a long time"
The old farmer quickly took off his straw sandals and sat down before his tiny dinner-tray.
The old man was left behind alone.
He could hardly believe what he had seen and heard.
After a while he came round and burst into tears.
He cried loudly and bitterly.
He rocked himself to and fro in his hopeless grief.
`` Oh dear , oh dear , oh dear !"
he wailed aloud.
Now , not far away there lived in the same mountain a kind , good-natured old rabbit.
The old man told him all that had happened.
The next day the weather was fine , and the rabbit went out to find the badger.
This time the rabbit made the badger go first.
The badger heard the flint striking , and asked : `` What is that noise.
` Crack , crack ' ?"
`` Oh , that is nothing"
The fire soon spread in the bundle of dry grass on the badger 's back.
The badger , hearing the crackle of the burning grass , asked , `` What is that ?"
`` Now we have come to the ` Burning Mountain , '"
answered the rabbit.
He now knew what had happened by the smell of the smoke of the burning grass.
Screaming with pain the badger ran as fast as he could to his hole.
The rabbit followed and found him lying on his bed groaning with pain.
`` What an unlucky fellow you are !"
said the rabbit.
The rabbit went away glad and smiling to think that the punishment upon the badger had already begun.
He went home and made an ointment by mixing some sauce and red pepper together.
The badger thanked him and begged him to apply it at once.
He rolled over and over and howled loudly.
The rabbit , looking on , felt that the farmer 's wife was beginning to be avenged.
This was just what the rabbit wanted , so he agreed.
Then he went home and built two boats , one of wood and the other of clay.
The day came when the rabbit had arranged to take the badger fishing.
He kept the wooden boat himself and gave the badger the clay boat.
They both got into their boats and set out.
He cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him.
Thus at last he kept his promise to the old farmer.
The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes.
THE shinansha , OR THE SOUTH POINTING CARRIAGE.
Now long ago in China , there was a still more wonderful invention called the shinansha.
No matter how the chariot was placed the figure always wheeled about and pointed to the South.
Kotei was the son of the Emperor Yuhi.
Soon after this her son Kotei came into the world.
Kotei in time grew to manhood and succeeded his father the Emperor Yuhi.
His early reign was greatly troubled by the rebel Shiyu.
Kotei again declared war against Shiyu.
He placed the shinansha in front of his army and led the way to the battlefield.
The battle began in earnest.
But this time no soldier minded the fog , not one was confused.
He closely pursued the rebel army and drove them backward till they came to a big river.
This river Kotei and his men found was swollen by the floods and impossible to cross.
Here he sat down on the bank and was lost in thought.
It was autumn.
The little insect was trying to get on to one of the floating leaves near by.
He set to work and persevered till he invented the first boat.
Kotei now took his army across the river , and attacked Shiyu 's headquarters.
As it came nearer Kotei saw that it was a great person_0.
The person_0 approached and bowed down its head before the Emperor.
The Empress and the courtiers were so frightened that they ran away screaming.
This is a messenger from Heaven.
My time here is finished !"
He then mounted the person_0 , which began to ascend towards the sky.
And they all ran and caught hold of the person_0 's beard and tried to mount him.
But it was impossible for so many people to ride on the person_0.
Meanwhile the Empress and a few of the courtiers were safely seated on the person_0 's back.
They were recognized as having belonged to the Emperor Kotei.
The courtiers took them up carefully and preserved them as sacred relics in the Palace"
His head was placed on the nine and ninetieth post.
Next day he meditated for a long time how he should hide himself , but all in vain.
Then he seized his gun and went out hunting.
He allowed it to dive down again , went onwards , and met a fox which was lame.
The youth let him go , and then as it was evening , returned home.
The raven hung his head and thought it over for a longtime.
At length he croaked , `` I have it"
He swallowed him , and went down to the bottom of the lake.
She ordered the fish to be caught and killed , and then the youth appeared.
Every one can imagine what a state of mind he was in.
`` Thou knowest how to find all kinds of hiding-places ,"
`` That 's a hard task ,"
answered the fox , looking very thoughtful.
At length he cried , `` I have it !"
And now the time arrived when she was to search for him.
She went back and felt the sea-hare beneath the braids of her hair.
The youth went straight to the palace.
The princess was already expecting him , and accommodated herself to her destiny.
The wedding was solemnized , and now he was king , and lord of all the kingdom.
The cow-herd answered , `` It is still standing out there eating.
It would not stop and come with us"
But the little peasant said , `` Oh , but I must have my beast back again"
The cow-herd said , `` It must have run away"
The peasant , however , said , `` Do n't tell me that ,"
, and gave him a slice of bread with cheese on it.
Just as they were about to sit down and eat , there was a knocking outside.
The woman said , `` Oh , heavens ! It is my husband !"
`` Ah ,"
The man said , `` I have no objection , but be quick and get me something to eat"
The woman said , `` But I have nothing but bread and cheese"
`` I am contented with anything ,"
replied the husband , `` so far as I am concerned , bread and cheese will do ,"
and looked at the peasant and said , `` Come and eat some more with me"
The peasant did not require to be invited twice , but got up and ate.
The peasant answered , `` I have a soothsayer inside it"
`` Can he foretell anything to me ?"
said the miller.
`` Why not ?"
answered the peasant , `` but he only says four things , and the fifth he keeps to himself"
The miller was curious , and said , `` Let him foretell something for once"
The miller said , `` What did he say ?"
`` Bless me !"
cried the miller , and went there and found the wine.
`` Now go on ,"
said he.
`` Upon my word !"
cried the miller , and went thither , and found the roast meat.
`` That would be a fine thing !"
cried the miller , and went there and found the salad.
`` That would be a fine thing !"
cried the miller , and looked there , and found the cakes.
Then the peasant once more pinched the raven 's head till he croaked loudly.
The miller asked , `` What did he say ?"
The miller said , `` The Devil must go out ,"
The peasant , however , made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred thalers.
He answered , `` I sold my cow 's skin in the town , for three hundred thalers"
The Mayor , however , said , `` But my servant must go first"
The peasant said , `` If thou wilt get in , thou wilt be Mayor"
The parson went to the crowd , and declared that the mass had been said.
Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water.
When the barrel began to roll , the shepherd cried , `` I am quite willing to be Mayor"
and they rolled the barrel down into the water.
`` Yes , truly ,"
Said the peasants , `` Are there any more there ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said he , `` more than I could do anything with"
There was once upon a time a miller who lived with his wife in great contentment.
They had money and land , and their prosperity increased year by year more and more.
He turned round and perceived a beautiful woman , rising slowly out of the water.
`` Be easy ,"
`` What else can that be ,"
thought the miller , `` but a young puppy or kitten ?"
and he promised her what she desired.
`` Of what use to me are riches and prosperity ?"
he added , `` if I am to lose my child ; but what can I do ?"
In the meantime prosperity again returned to the miller 's house.
It was not long before his wealth was greater than it had ever been before.
Whenever he passed the mill-pond , he feared she might ascend and remind him of his debt.
He never let the boy himself go near the water.
`` Beware ,"
The boy grew up to be a youth and was apprenticed to a huntsman.
When it was evening , and the huntsman did not return home , his wife became alarmed.
The surface of the water remained calm , only the crescent moon stared steadily back at her.
The poor woman did not leave the pond.
Presently a dream took possession of her.
She laboriously climbed the mountain ; everything was exactly as she had seen it in the night.
The old woman received her kindly , and pointed out a chair on which she might sit.
`` Thou must have met with a misfortune ,"
she said , `` since thou hast sought out my lonely cottage"
With tears , the woman related what had befallen her.
`` Be comforted ,"
said the old woman , `` I will help thee.
Here is a golden comb for thee.
When thou hast done , lay it down on the bank , and thou wilt see what will happen"
The woman returned home , but the time till the full moon came , passed slowly.
He did not speak , but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances.
Next morning she again set out and complained of her woes to the wise woman.
The wife did as the old woman told her.
`` Alas , what does it profit me ?"
said the unhappy woman , `` that I should see my beloved , only to lose him again !"
He quickly sprang to the shore , caught his wife by the hand and fled.
High mountains and deep valleys lay between them.
In order to keep themselves alive , they were both obliged to tend sheep.
When he had finished he saw that the shepherdess was weeping bitterly.
`` Why art thou weeping ?"
he asked.
`` Alas ,"
They embraced and kissed each other , and no one need ask if they were happy"
If you desert me like this , I will tell the Princess Labam"
Then the parrots all flew back to their person_0 , chattering.
The prince was greatly surprised , and said , `` Why , these birds can talk !"
Then he said to the parrots , `` Who is the Princess Labam ? Where does she live ?"
But the parrots would not tell him where she lived.
`` You can never get to the Princess Labam 's country"
That is all they would say.
.
`` I must go ,"
he said ; `` I must see what she is like.
Tell me where her country is"
`` We do not know where it is ,"
answered his father and mother.
`` Then I must go and look for it ,"
said the prince.
`` No , no ,"
they said , `` you must not leave us.
You are our only son.
Stay with us.
You will never find the Princess Labam"
`` I must try and find her ,"
said the prince.
`` Perhaps God will show me the way.
Still I must go"
So they had to let him go , though they cried very much at parting with him.
His father gave him fine clothes to wear , and a fine horse.
he said , `` I may want them"
His father , too , gave him plenty of rupees.
`` My child ,"
she said to him , `` When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats"
He bathed himself and his horse in the tank , and then sat down under a tree.
`` Now ,"
He opened his handkerchief , and took out a sweetmeat.
He found an ant in it.
He took out another.
There was an ant in that one too.
`` Never mind ,"
he said , `` I wo n't eat the sweetmeats ; the ants shall eat them"
Then the Ant-person_0 came and stood before him and said , `` You have been good to us.
If ever you are in trouble , think of me and we will come to you"
The person_0 's son thanked him , mounted his horse and continued his journey.
`` Why do you roar like that ?"
said the young person_0.
`` What is the matter with you ?"
`` I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years ,"
answered the tiger , `` and it hurts me so ; that is why I roar"
`` Well ,"
said the person_0 's son , `` I will take it out for you.
`` Oh , no ,"
said the tiger , `` I wo n't eat you.
Do make me well"
`` What man hurt you that you roared so loud ?"
said the wife.
`` No one hurt me ,"
answered the husband ; `` but a person_0 's son came and took the thorn out of my foot"
`` Where is he ? Show him to me ,"
said his wife.
`` If you promise not to kill him , I will call him ,"
said the tiger.
`` I wo n't kill him ; only let me see him ,"
answered his wife.
Then they gave him a good dinner , and he stayed with them for three days.
The person_0 's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle.
and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up.
The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things.
One said , `` I want this ;"
another said , `` You can not have it , for I want it ;"
and so on.
The person_0 's son said to them , `` Do not quarrel for these things.
I will shoot four arrows in four different directions.
Whichever of you gets to my first arrow , shall have the first thing -- the bed.
Whosoever gets to the second arrow , shall have the second thing -- the bag.
He who gets to the third arrow , shall have the third thing -- the bowl.
And he who gets to the fourth arrow , shall have the last things -- the stick and rope"
To this they agreed , and the prince shot off his first arrow.
Away raced the fakirs to get it.
Then he said , `` Bed , I wish to go to the Princess Labam 's country"
The person_0 's son asked some men he saw , `` Whose country is this ?"
`` The Princess Labam 's country ,"
they answered.
Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman.
`` Who are you ?"
she said.
`` Where do you come from ?"
`` I come from a far country ,"
he said ; `` do let me stay with you to - night"
`` No ,"
You can not stay in my house"
`` You are my aunty ,"
said the prince ; `` let me remain with you for this one night.
`` Well ,"
Then she took him into her house , and the person_0 's son was very glad.
The old woman began preparing dinner , but he stopped her , `` Aunty ,"
he said , `` I will give you food"
He put his hand into his bag , saying , `` Bag , I want some dinner ,"
and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner , served up on two gold plates.
The old woman and the person_0 's son then dined together.
When they had finished eating , the old woman said , `` Now I will fetch some water"
`` Do n't go ,"
said the prince.
`` You shall have plenty of water directly"
So he took his bowl and said to it , `` Bowl , I want some water ,"
and then it filled with water.
When it was full , the prince cried out , `` Stop , bowl ,"
and the bowl stopped filling.
`` See , aunty ,"
he said , `` with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want"
By this time night had come.
`` Aunty ,"
said the person_0 's son , `` why do n't you light a lamp ?"
`` There is no need ,"
she said.
When it was quite black night the princess got up.
Then she shone like the moon , and her beauty made night day.
She came out of her room , and sat on the roof of her palace.
In the daytime she never came out of her house ; she only came out at night.
All the people in her father 's country then went about their work and finished it.
The person_0 's son watched the princess quietly , and was very happy.
He said to himself , `` How lovely she is !"
`` Bed ,"
he said to it , `` I want to go to the Princess Labam 's bed-room"
So the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep.
and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf.
Next morning all the princess 's servants found the betel-leaf , and began to eat it.
`` Where did you get all that betel-leaf ?"
asked the princess.
`` We found it near your bed ,"
answered the servants.
Nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there.
In the morning the old woman came to the person_0 's son.
`` Now it is morning ,"
`` I am ill to-day , dear aunty ,"
said the prince ; `` do let me stay till to-morrow morning"
`` Good ,"
said the old woman.
Then the person_0 's son sat on his bed , and it carried him to the princess.
He took his bag and said , `` Bag , I want a most lovely shawl"
It gave him a splendid shawl , and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep.
Then he went back to the old woman 's house and slept till morning.
In the morning , when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted.
`` See , mother ,"
she said ; `` Khuda must have given me this shawl , it is so beautiful"
Her mother was very glad too.
`` Yes , my child ,"
she said ; `` Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl"
`` Aunty ,"
he answered , `` I am not well enough yet.
Let me stay a few days longer.
I will remain hidden in your house , so that no one may see me"
So the old woman let him stay.
At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep.
Then the person_0 's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room.
There he said to his bag , `` Bag , I want a very , very beautiful ring"
The bag gave him a glorious ring.
`` Who are you ?"
she said to the prince.
`` Where do you come from ? Why do you come to my room ?"
`` Do not be afraid , princess ,"
he said ; `` I am no thief.
I am a great person_0 's son.
`` Well ,"
Her mother told this to the king.
`` Good ,"
If he fails I will kill him.
If he can not do this he shall die"
In the morning the person_0 's son told the old woman that he intended to marry the princess.
`` Oh ,"
He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do whatever he bids him.
You will be killed too , if you try.
Do go away"
But the prince would not listen to anything she said.
`` Whoever wishes to marry my daughter ,"
he said to the prince , `` must first do all I tell him.
If he can not , then I have him killed.
So if you can not crush all the oil out of this mustard seed , you will die"
The prince was very sorry when he heard this.
`` How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day ?"
he said to himself ; `` and if I do not , the king will kill me"
`` Why do you look so sad ?"
said the Ant-person_0.
`` Be happy ,"
The person_0 's son lay down and slept , and the ants crushed out the oil for him.
The prince was very glad when he saw the oil.
The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king.
But the king said , `` You can not yet marry my daughter.
If you wish to do so , you must first fight with my two demons and kill them"
When he heard of the demons the person_0 's son was very sad.
`` What can I do ?"
he said to himself.
`` How can I fight with these two demons ?"
How can I do this ?"
`` Do not be frightened ,"
said the tiger.
`` Be happy.
I and my wife will fight with them for you"
Then the person_0 's son took out of his bag two splendid coats.
They were all gold and silver , and covered with pearls and diamonds.
`` Yes ,"
`` Then call your demons ,"
said the person_0 's son , `` and these tigers will fight them"
`` That is good ,"
said the king.
`` But you must do something else before I give you my daughter.
Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum.
You must go and beat it.
If you can not do this , I will kill you"
`` Little bed ,"
he said , `` up in the sky is the king 's kettle-drum.
I want to go to it"
Still , when he came down , the king would not give him his daughter.
`` You have ,"
`` If I can , I will ,"
said the person_0 's son.
Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his court-house.
It was a very , very thick trunk.
The person_0 's son went back to the old woman 's house.
He was very sad , and thought that now the person_0 would certainly kill him.
`` I had his oil crushed out by the ants ,"
he said to himself.
`` I had his demons killed by the tigers.
My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum.
At night he went on his bed to see the princess.
`` To-morrow ,"
he said to her , `` your father will kill me"
`` Why ?"
asked the princess.
`` He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet.
How can I ever do that ?"
said the person_0 's son.
`` Do not be afraid ,"
Then she pulled out a hair from her head , and gave it to the prince.
`` To-morrow ,"
' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet 's blade"
The king said , `` Now you can marry my daughter"
Then the wedding took place.
He therefore seated Hans behind the stove , and had it made very hot.
`` Yes ,"
said Hans , `` I will do all that"
`` Dear friend ,"
`` Were you indeed at the wedding ?"
`` Yes , indeed I was there , and in full dress.
My head-dress was of snow ; then the sun came out , and it was melted.
and broke in two"
`` How in the world can I get some ?"
thought he ? At last he hit upon a plan.
`` What do you want , Mr.
Crow ? You and I do n't feed alike"
The Pigeon agreed , and they went on in company.
Let 's be going home before it is too late"
And so they did.
Says the Pigeon to the Crow : `` Come , Sir Crow , and get your breakfast !"
' `` Oh dear ! oh dear ! I have such a fit of indigestion !"
says he.
`` Nonsense ! Crows never have indigestion ,"
said the Pigeon.
Now do what I tell you ; do n't behave in this way just for seeing a little fish"
`` Why do you say that , master ? I have indigestion"
`` Well , be careful ,"
said the Pigeon , and flew away.
`` Now 's my time !"
thought Mr.
Crow , and alighted on a dish containing some dainty food.
Click ! The cook heard it , and looked round.
`` That 's for spoiling my master 's dinner and making me throw it away !"
said he , and threw him into his basket.
I would not do as I was told , So now I 'm plucked , as you behold"
Then the Pigeon flew away , saying : `` I ca n't live with this creature any longer"
And the Crow lay there groaning till he died"
Fatty Coon was very fond of squirrels.
So of course you will understand now why the squirrels did not care for Fatty at all.
In fact , they usually kept just as far away from him as they could.
But at night -- ah ! that was a very different matter.
Fatty thought it great sport to hunt squirrels at night.
Whenever he tried it he usually managed to get a good meal.
But a night came at last when Fatty was well punished for hunting squirrels.
He rather thought that some squirrels lived inside that hole.
And as he listened for a few seconds he could hear something moving about inside.
Yes ! Fatty was sure that there was a squirrel in there -- probably several squirrels.
Fatty Coon 's eyes turned green.
He reached a paw inside the hole and felt all around.
Something had given him a cruel dig.
And in a jiffy Fatty saw what that `` something"
was.
It was a grumpy old tramp coon , whom Fatty had never seen before.
`` What do you mean , you young rascal , by disturbing me like this ?"
the ragged stranger cried.
`` Please , sir , I never knew it was you ,"
Fatty stammered.
`` Never knew it was me ! Who did you think it was ?"
`` A -- a squirrel !"
Fatty said faintly.
And he whimpered a little , because his paw hurt him.
`` Ho , ho ! That 's a good one ! That 's a good joke !"
The tramp coon laughed heartily.
And then he scowled so fiercely that poor Fatty nearly tumbled out of the tree.
`` You go home ,"
he said to Fatty.
`` And do n't you let me catch you around here again.
You hear ?"
`` Yes , sir !"
Fatty said.
And home he went.
And you may be sure that he let THAT tree alone after that.
He never went near it again"
When Jasper Jay told person_0 Coon about Farmer Green 's forty fat turkeys person_0 felt hungrier than ever.
`` Oh ! I must n't go near Farmer Green 's house !"
he said.
`` My mother told me to keep away from there.
What time did you say the turkeys go to roost ?"
`` Oh ! they go to roost every night at sundown ,"
Jasper Jay explained.
`` And there they sit , up in the tree , all night long.
They 're fast asleep.
And you would have no trouble at all in catching as many as you wanted.
And maybe they 'd have the manners to say ` Thank you ! ' too"
And with a hoarse , sneering laugh Jasper Jay flew away.
That was enough for person_0.
He made up his mind that he would show Jasper Jay that HE was not afraid.
And he wanted a turkey to eat , too.
He said nothing to his mother about Jasper 's news.
person_0 did not intend to make any noise.
He could see the turkeys plainly where they dozed on the bare branches.
And in less time than it takes to tell it person_0 had climbed the tree.
On the very lowest limb there was a row of four plump turkeys , all sound asleep.
And person_0 reached out and seized the nearest one.
He seized the turkey by the neck , so that the big bird could not call out.
But person_0 was not quite quick enough.
Then the next turkey on the limb woke up.
Farmer Green 's window flew up ; and Farmer Green 's voice called `` Spot ! Spot !"
person_0 Coon did not wait to hear anything more.
He dropped the turkey he had seized and slipped down to the ground.
And then he ran toward the woods as fast as he could go.
Farmer Green 's dog Spot was barking now.
And person_0 wanted to climb one of the trees by the roadside.
So he never stopped until he reached the woods.
Then he went nimbly up into the trees.
He never said anything to his mother about Farmer Green 's turkeys.
But the next time he saw Jasper Jay person_0 told him exactly what he thought of him.
`` Ha ! ha !"
Jasper Jay only laughed.
And he did not seem at all surprised that person_0 had fallen into trouble.
To tell the truth , he was only sorry because person_0 had escaped.
Jasper Jay did not like person_0 Coon.
`` Wait till I catch you !"
person_0 said.
But Jasper Jay only laughed harder than ever when person_0 said that.
He seemed to think it was a great joke.
He was most annoying"
Long , long ago there lived , an old man and.
.
As she was busy washing her clothes a great peach came bumping down the stream.
The old woman looked up from her work and saw this large peach.
`` How delicious that peach must be !"
she said to herself.
`` I must certainly get it and take it home to my old man"
Stopping a moment to think what she would do , she remembered an old charm-verse.
The old woman was delighted.
It seemed a very long time to her to wait till her husband returned.
`` What is the matter ? Why are you so impatient ?"
asked the old man , wondering at her unusual eagerness.
`` Has anything happened while I have been away ?"
`` Oh , no !"
`` That is good ,"
said the old man.
He then washed his feet in a basin of water and stepped up to the veranda.
It felt even heavier than before.
`` I did not buy it ,"
answered the old woman.
`` I found it in the river where I was washing"
And she told him the whole story.
`` I am very glad that you have found it.
Let us eat it now , for I am hungry ,"
said the O Fii San.
and out stepped a beautiful little child.
The child spoke again : `` Do n't be afraid.
I am no demon or fairy.
I will tell you the truth.
Heaven has had compassion on you.
Every day and every night you have lamented that you had no child.
Your cry has been heard and I am sent to be the son of your old age !"
On hearing this the old man and his wife were very happy.
The years passed quickly by and the child grew to be fifteen years of age.
I do not know how to thank you enough"
`` Why ,"
Indeed , I am rather surprised that you should thank me in this way !"
and the old man looked bothered.
`` I hope you will be patient with me ,"
`` Then let me go away at once !"
`` I will surely come back again , if you let me go now !"
`` Where are you going ?"
`` You must think it strange that I want to go away ,"
said person_0 , `` because I have not yet told you my reason.
Far away from here to the northeast of Japan there is an island in the sea.
This island is the stronghold of a band of devils.
They are not only very wicked but they are disloyal to our Emperor and disobey his laws.
These devils are very hateful beings.
It is for this reason that I want to go away for a short time !"
The old man was much surprised at hearing all this from a mere boy of fifteen.
He thought it best to let the boy go.
`` All you say is very interesting , person_0 ,"
said the old man.
`` I will not hinder you in your determination.
You may go if you wish.
`` Thank you , for all your kindness ,"
said person_0 , who began to get ready to go that very day.
He was full of courage and did not know what fear was.
At last the cakes were made and person_0 was ready to start on his long journey.
Parting is always sad.
So it was now.
We expect you back victorious !"
But he said `` Good-by !"
quite bravely.
`` I am going now.
Take good care of yourselves while I am away.
Good - by !"
And he stepped quickly out of the house.
In silence the eyes of person_0 and his parents met in farewell.
person_0 now hurried on his way till it was midday.
The dog 's manner at once changed.
Not knowing who you were I have behaved in a very stupid way.
`` I think I can take you with me if you wish to go ,"
said person_0.
`` Thank you !"
said the dog.
`` By the way , I am very very hungry.
Will you give me one of the cakes you are carrying ?"
`` This is the best kind of cake there is in Japan ,"
said person_0.
`` I can not spare you a whole one ; I will give you half of one"
`` Thank you very much ,"
said the dog , taking the piece thrown to him.
Then person_0 got up and the dog followed.
For a long time they walked over the hills and through the valleys.
As they were going along an animal came down from a tree a little ahead of them.
Will you allow me to go with you ?"
The dog answered jealously : `` person_0 already has a dog to accompany him.
`` Now , do n't quarrel !"
said person_0 , putting himself between them.
`` Wait a moment , dog !"
`` It is not at all dignified for you to have such a creature as that following you !"
said the dog.
`` What do you know about it ?"
`` I am a monkey living in these hills ,"
replied the monkey"
Nothing will please me more than to follow you !"
`` Do you really wish to go to the Island of Devils and fight with me ?"
`` Yes , sir ,"
replied the monkey.
`` I admire your courage ,"
said person_0.
`` Here is a piece of one of my fine rice-cakes.
Come along !"
So the monkey joined person_0.
The dog and the monkey did not get on well together.
By and by they came to a large field.
Here a bird flew down and alighted on the ground just in front of the little party.
It was the most beautiful bird person_0 had ever seen.
The dog at once ran at the bird and tried to seize and kill it.
It would certainly make a good fighter.
Surrender at once , and I will take you with me.
If you do n't I will set this dog to bite your head off !"
Then the bird surrendered at once , and begged to be taken into person_0 's company.
I am a miserable bird called a pheasant.
It is very generous of you to pardon my rudeness and to take me with you.
Please allow me to follow you behind the dog and the monkey !"
`` I congratulate you on surrendering so soon ,"
said person_0 , smiling.
`` Come and join us in our raid on the devils"
`` Are you going to take this bird with you also ?"
asked the dog , interrupting.
`` Humph !"
said the dog.
Then person_0 stood and gave this order : `` Now all of you must listen to me.
The first thing necessary in an army is harmony.
When we are not at peace amongst ourselves it is no easy thing to subdue an enemy.
The one who first begins a quarrel will be discharged on the spot !"
All the three promised not to quarrel.
The pheasant was now made a member of person_0 's suite , and received half a cake.
Hurrying on day after day they at last came out upon the shore of the North-Eastern Sea.
All that broke the stillness was the rolling of the waves upon the shore.
It will be far better for me to go alone.
I discharge you all at once !"
`` Please , person_0 !"
said the dog.
`` We have come thus far !"
said the monkey.
`` It is inhuman to leave us here !"
said the pheasant.
`` We are not at all afraid of the sea ,"
said the monkey again.
`` Please do take us with you ,"
said the pheasant.
`` Do please ,"
said the dog.
person_0 now got a small ship , and they all got on board.
The wind and weather were fair , and the ship went like an arrow over the sea.
person_0 knew at once that what they saw was the devils ' stronghold.
On the top of the precipitous shore , looking out to sea , was a large castle.
His three followers watched him , waiting for orders.
said person_0 to the bird , `` for you have good wings.
Fly at once to the castle and engage the demons to fight.
We will follow you"
The pheasant at once obeyed.
He flew off from the ship beating the air gladly with his wings.
Wait till you get a blow from one of our iron bars !"
Very angry , indeed , were the devils.
In the meantime , person_0 had brought his ship to land.
They soon came upon two beautiful damsels washing clothes in a stream.
He stopped and spoke to them : `` Who are you , and why do you weep ?"
`` We are captives of the Demon King.
And their tears burst out afresh at this horrible thought.
`` I will rescue you ,"
said person_0.
`` Do not weep any more , only show me how I may get into the castle"
person_0 's onslaught was so furious that the devils could not stand against him.
The chief of the devils at last was the only one left.
`` I am afraid of you ,"
he said meekly.
`` I can not stand against you.
I will give you all the treasure hidden in this castle if you will spare my life !"
person_0 laughed.
Then person_0 tied the devil chief up and gave him into the monkey 's charge.
He was called Rin Jin , or the person_1 of the Sea.
So he decided to take a wife.
At last they returned to the Palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon.
All the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned them.
Never had there been such an assemblage or such gay festivities in the Fish-World before.
Now for a time the person_1 and his bride lived very happily.
Life seemed to them both like a long summer 's day.
Then the person_1 interviewed the doctor and blamed him for not curing the Queen.
`` Do you mean to tell me that you ca n't get the medicine here ?"
asked the person_1.
`` It is just as you say !"
said the doctor.
`` Tell me what it is you want for the Queen ?"
demanded Rin Jin.
`` I want the liver of a live monkey !"
answered the doctor.
`` The liver of a live monkey ! Of course that will be most difficult to get ,"
said the person_0.
`` If we could only get that for the Queen , Her Majesty would soon recover ,"
said the doctor.
`` Very well , that decides it ; we MUST get it somehow or other.
But where are we most likely to find a monkey ?"
asked the person_0.
`` If only you could capture one of these monkeys ?"
said the doctor.
`` How can any of my people capture a monkey ?"
said the person_1 , greatly puzzled.
`` That has been my difficulty too ,"
said the doctor.
`` Something must be done ,"
said the person_0 , and calling his chief steward he consulted him on the matter.
Let us send him to the Island of Monkeys to catch one"
`` Well ,"
The only way is to play a trick on one !"
said the perplexed jelly fish.
`` This is what you must do ,"
said the wily chief steward.
`` But how am I to get the monkey here ? You know monkeys do n't swim ?"
said the reluctant jelly fish.
`` You must carry him on your back.
What is the use of your shell if you ca n't do that !"
said the chief steward.
`` Wo n't he be very heavy ?"
queried kurage again.
`` You must n't mind that , for you are working for the person_1 ,"
replied the chief steward.
`` I will do my best then ,"
`` I 'm in luck !"
thought the jelly fish.
So the jelly fish slowly walked towards the pine-tree.
In those ancient days the jelly fish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise.
Monkey ? Is n't it a lovely day ?"
`` A very fine day ,"
answered the monkey from the tree.
`` I have never seen you in this part of the world before.
Where have you come from and what is your name ?"
`` My name is kurage or jelly fish.
I am one of the servants of the person_1.
I have heard so much of your beautiful island that I have come on purpose to see it ,"
answered the jelly fish.
`` I am very glad to see you ,"
said the monkey.
`` By the bye ,"
`` I have often heard of it , but I have never seen it !"
answered the monkey.
`` Then you ought most surely to come.
It is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it.
said the jelly fish.
`` Is it so beautiful as all that ?"
asked the monkey in astonishment.
`` I have got him at last !"
thought the jelly fish , but aloud he said : `` Mr.
Monkey.
I must now go back.
`` I should love to go ,"
`` There is no difficulty about that.
I can carry you on my back"
`` That will be troubling you too much ,"
said the monkey.
`` I can do it quite easily.
I am stronger than I look , so you need n't hesitate ,"
said the jelly fish , and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea.
`` Keep very still , Mr.
monkey ,"
said the jelly fish.
`` Please do n't go so fast , or I am sure I shall fall off ,"
said the monkey.
Monkey , tell me , have you such a thing as a liver with you ?"
`` That is the most important thing of all ,"
`` Why is my liver so important to you ?"
asked the monkey.
`` Oh ! you will learn the reason later ,"
said the jelly fish.
said the silly jelly fish.
He trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him.
thought the monkey.
Jelly Fish , that you did not speak of this before we left the island !"
answered the jelly fish.
`` You are quite mistaken ,"
said the monkey.
If I had only guessed of what you were in need.
I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked.
I have several livers.
`` Have you left your liver behind you ?"
asked the jelly fish.
`` Yes ,"
The monkey was of no good without a liver.
Finally the jelly fish stopped and told the monkey so.
`` Well ,"
said the monkey , `` that is soon remedied.
Thus persuaded , the jelly fish turned his course towards the Monkey Island once more.
The jelly fish wondered at this speech and the mocking tone in which it was uttered.
`` But remember your promise !"
pleaded the jelly fish , now very discouraged.
`` That promise was false , and anyhow it is now broken !"
answered the monkey.
added the monkey mockingly from the tree.
When they caught sight of him approaching the Palace , they hailed him with delight.
Now the day of reckoning had come for the jelly fish.
He quaked all over as he told his story.
The punishment was a horrible one.
The poor jelly fish , humiliated and horrified beyond all words , cried out for pardon.
But the person_1 's order had to be obeyed.
`` Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
It sounds up from the `` bell-deep ,"
in the Odense-Au.
Opposite the old nunnery is the deepest place , which is called the `` bell-deep ,"
and there dwells the old water spirit , the `` Au-mann"
Alban 's.
`` Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
`` Ding-dong ! ding-dong ! Now I 'll retire to rest !"
But the bell got neither rest nor sleep.
-LRB- Illustration : THE AU-MANN LISTENING TO THE BELL.
Alban , the monk mounted up into the tower.
He was young and handsome , but thoughtful exceedingly.
Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
Yes , this was the story the bell told.
I may sing of everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars.
Yonder it is cold and wet.
' `` There was a king in those days ; they called him Canute.
He sought shelter in the church , and shut gate and door behind him.
The violent band surrounded the church ; I heard tell of it.
Ding-dong ! ding-dong !"
Thus it sounds complainingly out of the bell-deep in the Odense-Au : that is what grandmother told us.
`` Be cautious , cautious , and take good heed to thyself ,"
they both say.
The air knows everything.
`` A funny kind of slip that ,"
said the plants.
And neither thistle nor stinging-nettle would recognize the stranger.
`` That must be a kind of garden plant ,"
said they.
`` Where are you coming ?"
cried the lofty thistles , whose leaves are all armed with thorns.
`` You give yourself a good deal of space.
That 's all nonsense -- we are not here to support you !"
they grumbled.
`` That must be some subordinate species ,"
he said.
`` I do n't know it.
It 's not included in any system"
`` Not included in any system !"
repeated the thistles and the nettles.
There came through the forest a poor innocent girl.
Her heart was pure , and her understanding was enlarged by faith.
They imagined evil in their hearts , but God turned it to good.
But the wonderful plant still bloomed without in the forest.
`` That 's giving itself foreign airs now ,"
said the thistles and the burdocks ; `` we never behave like that here"
And the black snails actually spat at the flower.
Then came the swineherd.
He was collecting thistles and shrubs , to burn them for the ashes.
The wonderful plant was placed bodily in his bundle.
`` It shall be made useful ,"
he said ; and so said , so done.
-LRB- Illustration : THE POOR GIRL 'S TREASURE.
He was busy and industrious , but that did him no good.
Its appearance is thus and thus.
It can not be mistaken"
`` I fancy it was taken up in my bundle , and burnt to ashes long ago ,"
said the swineherd ; `` but I did not know any better"
`` You did n't know any better ! Ignorance of ignorances !"
And the king himself , in his melancholy , wandered out to the spot in the wood.
`` Here is where the plant stood ,"
he said ; `` it is a sacred place"
And the place was surrounded with a golden railing , and a sentry was posted there.
The botanical professor wrote a long treatise upon the heavenly plant.
And indeed that was the most agreeable part of the whole story.
There was a certain Brahman in a certain village , named Harisarman.
While he was anxiously expecting to be fed , no one thought of him.
and Sthuladatta then propitiated the Brahman with these words -- `` I forgot you , forgive me"
-- and asked him to tell him who had taken away their horse.
and then he was placed in a chamber by the king , and carefully guarded.
And he was sad because he had pretended to have knowledge.
So spare me , and receive the small quantity of gold which is in my possession"
But whatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me"
When he said this to the maid , she consented , and departed quickly.
Secret crimes manifest themselves by means of fear"
Thus thinking , he passed the night happily in the chamber.
Then the king was pleased , and gave him the revenue of many villages.
It will be much better to test him by some new artifice"
So Harisarman prospered in the world"
The following story is one of the strangest that ever was heard.
After our father 's death , the estate that he left was equally divided among us.
Believe what I say , and let us live together as comfortably as we can.
' Upon this I embraced them again , and we lived together as we did formerly.
I went from thence into a room richly hung and furnished , where I perceived a lady.
Meantime night came on , which put me in mind that it was time to retire.
At the sight of this I was transported with wonder.
Hear me , O Lord , and grant my request.
` My dear lady , ' said the young man , ` have patience for a moment.
I will acquaint you with the most remarkable effect of His greatness and power.
`` Dear prince ,"
We left the furniture and goods , which consisted of an infinite quantity of plate , etc.
Nor will I pretend to have any power over your actions.
They did the same to the prince , who was drowned.
.
The other , finding himself at liberty , took to his wings and flew away.
I sat up and asked her who she was.
` These two black dogs are your sisters , whom I have transformed into this shape.
' I was forced to promise that I would obey her order.
For many months I whipped them every night , though with regret.
They soon after married the sons of kings , and lived happily for the rest of their lives"
It was in the month of May.
Then they drove to the castle , where there were lofty halls and splendid apartments.
It was charming to behold.
But the branch became proud ; and this was quite like human nature.
`` Poor despised herbs !"
said the apple branch.
Certainly there is a difference , and distinctions must be made , or we should all be equal"
or `` dog-flower"
`` Poor despised plants !"
said the apple branch.
`` It is not your fault that you received the ugly name you bear.
But it is with plants as with men -- there must be a difference !"
`` A difference ?"
What is the despised plant that you especially pity ?"
`` The dandelion ,"
replied the apple branch.
`` It is never received into a nosegay ; it is trodden under foot.
They are nothing but weeds -- but it is right there should be weeds too.
Oh , I 'm really very thankful that I was not created one of those flowers"
`` Do you see ?"
said the sunbeam.
`` Do you see the beauty of those flowers ? do you see their power ?"
`` Yes , over children ,"
replied the apple branch.
`` But beauty is a higher thing !"
said the apple tree branch.
`` Only the chosen few can be admitted into the realm of beauty.
There is a difference among plants , just as there is a difference among men"
`` Yes , yes , that is your opinion ,"
the apple branch persisted.
She carried in her hand a flower , or something of the kind.
`` Look , with what singular beauty Providence has invested it ,"
she said.
A singularity we needs must own , With this the wife was long familiar grown.
WITH perfect justice Heav ` n its gifts bestows ; But equal talents all should not compose.
The lawyer , points of difficulty views , Decides with judgment , and the truth pursues.
WITH pleasures feasted , our gallant retired , Before the morn fresh blushes had acquired.
WITHIN the royal breast suspicions rose , But nothing then the monarch would disclose.
In doubt how this adventure yet might end , He thought to seem asleep would him befriend.
Once there was a miller who was poor , but who had a beautiful daughter.
Thereupon he himself locked up the room , and left her in it alone.
`` Alas !"
`` What will you give me ,"
said the manikin , `` if I do it for you ?"
`` My necklace ,"
said the girl.
`` The ring on my finger ,"
answered the girl.
`` Even if she be a miller 's daughter ,"
thought he , `` I could not find a richer wife in the whole world"
`` I have nothing left that I could give ,"
answered the girl.
`` Then promise me , if you should become Queen , your first child"
`` Who knows whether that will ever happen ?"
But suddenly he came into her room , and said , `` Now give me what you promised"
Then the Queen began to weep and cry , so that the manikin pitied her.
`` I will give you three days ' time ,"
`` Perhaps your name is Shortribs , or Sheepshanks , or Laceleg ?"
but he always answered , `` That is not my name"
Ha ! glad am I that no one knew That Rumpelstiltskin I am styled"
at first she said , `` Is your name Conrad ?"
`` No"
`` Is your name Harry ?"
`` No"
`` Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin ?"
`` The devil has told you that ! the devil has told you that !"
In this way life is endurable"
I , however , lay myself in the oat-chest and sleep for four hours.
Who is going to make a great business of that ? Nevertheless service is too toilsome for me"
I have already had several injuries of that kind"
It is enough and to spare if I take out a cartful in the day.
I have no fancy for killing myself with work"
If I am to get on , four sturdy men must push me with all their might.
I came where six men were lying sleeping on a bed beside each other.
I lay down by them and slept too.
At the very most , I only turn myself so that it can shine on me"
The tenth said , `` Laziness has brought misfortune on me , a broken leg and swollen calf.
Three of us were lying in the road , and I had my legs stretched out.
Some one came with a cart , and the wheels went over me.
The eleventh said , `` I gave up my place yesterday.
There was no end of it all day long.
Some one had come by , who had carried all off.
Besides this , the cart had got into a quagmire and stuck fast.
I left it standing , and stretched myself on the straw again.
`` Now , dear John ,"
`` No , master ,"
he answered , `` I have not found the cow , but then I have not looked for it"
`` Then what hast thou looked for , John ?"
`` Something better , and that luckily I have found"
`` What is that , John ?"
`` Three blackbirds ,"
answered the boy.
`` And where are they ?"
asked the master.
answered the wise boy.
Each of them only bore his human form for only two hours daily.
The small men are cleverer than we are , so we will leave the decision to thee"
`` How can you dispute about an old cap ?"
said the youth.
`` Give me the cap ,"
But how shocked he was when he saw her.
She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles , blear eyes , and red hair.
`` Are you the King 's daughter , whose beauty the whole world praises ?"
cried he.
`` Ah ,"
Then said he , `` How canst thou be set free ? I fear no danger"
Ah ,"
`` Nothing can keep me from doing it ,"
said he , `` but tell me what I must do"
`` Thou shalt know everything ,"
The youth went down to the spring , where the bull snorted and bellowed at him.
With this canst thou likewise give back to thy brothers their human form"
In our voyage we touched at several islands , where we sold or exchanged our goods.
There belonged to this king an island named Cassel.
I saw likewise other fishes , about a cubit in length , that had heads like owls.
I acquainted him with the whole story.
My family and I received one another with transports of sincere friendship.
I bought slaves and fine lands , and built me a great house.
by Indian Writer A poor blind Brahman and his wife were dependent on their son for their subsistence.
Every day the young fellow used to go out and get what he could by begging.
He begged her to be industrious , lest his parents should be angry and curse him.
Here he went and sat down by a merchant 's shop and asked alms.
Accordingly , on the following morning she went to the place and met her husband.
`` Why have you come here ?"
he asked.
`` No , no ,"
said the woman.
`` I can not go back to starve and see your old father and mother die.
There is not a grain of rice left in the house"
`` O Bhagawant !"
exclaimed the Brahman.
`` Here , take this ,"
You will see that he will give you a lac of rupees for it"
Thus saying he dismissed her , and the woman left.
The king read the paper , and ordering the man to be flogged , dismissed him.
The poor Brahmani was very thankful.
He thought his father would applaud the act.
But it was not so.
The king was more angry than before , and banished his son from the country.
The prince accepted the invitation , and was treated like a prince.
Matting was spread for him to squat on , and the best provisions set before him.
`` Ah !"
I will not sleep to-night"
But he rose up and spoke.
`` Do not slay me ,"
he said.
`` What man ? What dog ?"
he asked.
`` I will tell you ,"
said the prince , `` if you will give me that sword"
He was suddenly reduced to poverty , and had to part with his dog.
Not long after this the other merchant 's shop was broken into by thieves and completely sacked.
There was hardly ten rupees ' worth left in the place.
The merchant himself nearly went mad.
Here the animal scraped and barked , and showed in various ways that the things were underneath.
Nothing was missing.
There was everything just as the thieves had taken them.
`` The merchant was very glad.
Thus there will be an end of my debt.
' `` No dog , no loan.
The merchant picked it up and read it.
How great was his grief and disappointment when he knew the facts of the case ! `` Beware ,"
The prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law.
News of the man and of his wonderful piety reached the ears of the king.
He thought that , perhaps , this holy man could do something for her.
So he sent to him.
Then the king took his wife and brought her to the jogi.
When the king heard this he was very angry , and ordered the jogi to be executed.
But he knew that the second bit of advice was true.
`` O fool ,"
`` Do not bother me ,"
said the potter.
`` What does it matter to you ?"
`` Pardon me ,"
said the prince , `` but I should like to know the reason"
`` The reason is this , then ,"
said the potter.
What can we do ?"
`` Truly a matter for laughing and weeping.
But weep no more ,"
said the prince.
Only give me suitable garments , and prepare me for the occasion"
So the potter gave him beautiful raiment and ornaments , and the prince went to the palace.
At night he was conducted to the apartment of the princess.
`` Dread hour !"
thought he ; `` am I to die like the scores of young men before me ?"
`` Surely ,"
said he , `` this man must be her husband , as he only can live with her"
`` Where do you come from ? Who are you ?"
asked the king , entering the room.
`` O king !"
replied the prince , `` I am the son of a king who rules over such-and-such a country"
Afterwards he went to his own home , and informed his mother and father of his arrival.
Alas ! his parents had both become blind from weeping about the loss of their son.
`` Let him come in ,"
said the king , `` and put his hands upon our eyes , and we shall see again"
Whereupon the king expressed his sorrow for having sent him away , and all was joy and peace again"
He tried everything he could think of.
But it was all of no use.
When the day began to draw to a close , he turned his face homewards.
He looked about for some shelter , but there was not even a charcoal-burner 's hut near.
At last he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree.
He thought that he must die of fright.
The more he looked , the greater was his astonishment.
All had horns growing on their foreheads.
Fortunately for him the demons did not see him , as the tree was in the background.
So he picked himself up and crept back into the tree.
`` What are these creatures doing ?"
said the old man to himself.
`` I will look out , it sounds very amusing"
It made the old man laugh to see their strange antics.
`` How amusing this is !"
In a little while he said with a bored air : `` Your dance is rather monotonous.
I am tired of watching it.
Is n't there any one amongst you all who can dance better than this fellow ?"
said the old fellow to himself.
His fears , however , were soon overcome by his love of dancing.
`` How strange !"
exclaimed the horned chief.
`` I never saw such a skillful dancer before ! He dances admirably !"
Now give us the pleasure of drinking a cup of wine with us ,"
and with these words he handed him his largest wine-cup.
I fear I have only disturbed your pleasant party by my unskillful dancing"
`` No , no ,"
answered the big demon.
`` You must come often and dance for us.
Your skill has given us much pleasure"
The old man thanked him again and promised to do so.
`` Then will you come again to-morrow , old man ?"
asked the demon.
`` Certainly , I will ,"
answered the old man.
`` Then you must leave some pledge of your word with us ,"
said the demon.
`` Whatever you like ,"
said the old man.
`` Now what is the best thing he can leave with us as a pledge ?"
asked the demon , looking round.
I see the old man has a wen on his right cheek.
Now mortal men consider such a wen very fortunate.
`` You are very clever ,"
said the demon chief , giving his horns an approving nod.
The old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened.
He hardly knew for some time where he was.
The old man suddenly realized how late it was and began to hurry home.
He found his wife very anxious , wondering what had happened to make him so late.
He soon told her all that had passed since he left home that afternoon.
Now next door to this good old couple there lived a wicked and disagreeable old man.
The good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to him.
Here he hid himself and waited for the twilight.
Why does n't he come ?"
`` Ah , you are the old man of yesterday ,"
said the demon chief.
`` Thank you for coming , you must dance for us soon"
The old man now stood up and opened his fan and began to dance.
We do n't wish to see any more of such dancing.
We will give you back the pledge you left with us.
You must go away at once"
_ This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about a Brother who had ceased striving after righteousness.
Said the Teacher to him : `` Is it really true that you have ceased all striving ?"
-- `` Yes , Blessed One ,"
he replied.
And he told a story of long ago.
`` Who shall be my teacher ?"
the lad asked.
Take this , and give it him for a fee"
With that he gave him a thousand pieces of money , and dismissed him.
On his way he came to a forest inhabited by the person_0 with the Matted Hair.
And they tried to stop him.
When he reached mid-forest the person_0 showed himself.
`` Where are you going ?"
he shouted.
`` Stop ! You 'll make a meal for me !"
Said the Bodhisatta : `` person_0 , I came here trusting in myself.
I advise you to be careful how you come near me.
Here 's a poisoned arrow , which I 'll shoot at you and knock you down !"
The arrow stuck fast in the person_0 's hair.
`` You , person_0 !"
This day will I pound you and grind you to powder !"
and his head stuck fast like the rest.
Since I have ravaged this road , I never saw such a man.
Now , why is it that he does not fear ?"
`` Why should I fear , person_0 ?"
replied he.
`` In one life a man can die but once.
That is why I fear nothing"
-LRB- By this , the Bodhisatta meant the weapon of knowledge which he had within him.
-RRB- When he heard this , the person_0 thought : `` This young man speaks the truth.
I 'll let him go !"
Go back to the company of your friends and relations !"
And the Bodhisatta said : `` person_0 , I will go , as you say.
If you still go on doing wickedly , you will go from darkness to darkness.
But now that you have seen me you will find it impossible to do wickedly.
At the end of the declaring of the Truths , this Brother also attained to sainthood.
_"
He dug and hoed his bit of land , and sowed it with turnip-seed.
`` What strange thing is this ?"
said the King.
`` Ah , no !"
said the farmer , `` no luck-child am I.
The other agreed to this , and accompanied him without suspicion.
The student looked round on every side , but did not know whence the voice came.
At last he said , `` Who calls me ?"
If you were once within it you would feel what noble things issue forth from the Sack of Knowledge"
and was about to get into the sack.
`` Halt !"
said the other , `` that wo n't do ,"
Keep perfectly quiet until thou becomest wiser"
The host was struck with what the spark averred , And muttered something indistinctly heard.
He most gallantly saw her safely home ; Attentions charm the sex where'er we roam.
To rouse his wrath the story quite sufficed ; The spouse resolved to do as she advised.
In hopes the wily spark to trap that night.
In that , replied the lady , we agree , And heartily thereto I pledged will be"
Your looks sufficiently the fact proclaim , For many instances I 've known the same.
Remember , cried the wife , to make them like.
Leave that to me , said he , I 'll justly strike.
The belle with tears replied , howe'er she 'd swerved , Such cruel treatment never she deserved.
Her innocence , and simple , gentle way , At length appeared his frantick rage to lay.
Poor innocent ! the point she nicely hit ; Fear oft gives simpletons a sort of wit.
When I was absent from my loving dear , Obligingly he made her babe an ear.
Each looker-on conceives , LOVE needs not greet Such humble wights , as he would prelates treat.
The project was most thoroughly approved ; Like inclination both the husbands moved.
ANTOINETTA , said the second spouse , Has neither ill nor scratch her fears to rouse.
I was not present , fully I admit ; But rarely clergymen their dues will quit.
IMMEDIATELY he ev ` ry effort tried , To get the bargain fully set aside.
At length the parliament would hear the claim , And judge a case of such peculiar fame.
I much regret my lot was not the same , Though doubtless many will my wishes blame"
`` It was in a little provincial town ,"
I saw it quite plainly.
I saw it all ,"
said the Moon.
` This must be a great dog , ' they said , and began to stroke him.
It was a charming sight to behold.
' And then the bear leader came running up"
`` I knew an old maid ,"
said the Moon.
Our family vault is six miles from here.
I shall be carried there , and shall sleep there among my family and relatives.
' Last night a van stopped at the house.
A coffin was carried out , and then I knew that she was dead.
They placed straw round the coffin , and the van drove away.
On the high-road the pace was quicker yet.
A hare jumped across the road and startled them , and they fairly ran away.
The lark rose up again , singing gaily , and I withdrew behind the red morning clouds"
Long , long ago there lived in Kyoto a brave soldier named Kintoki.
Now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her.
She called him person_0 or the Golden Boy.
and his mother the `` Old Nurse of the Mountains ,"
for they did not know her high rank.
Another favorite pastime of person_0 's was to smash up rocks and stones.
But his special retainers were the bear , the deer , the monkey and the hare.
Great was the fun they all had together.
Here , indeed , was a nice place where they could all have a good romp together.
person_0 said , `` Here is a place for a good game.
What do you all say to a wrestling match ?"
said she.
`` I am the strongest animal , so I will make the platform for the wrestlers ;"
`` All right ,"
said person_0 , `` I will look on while you all wrestle with each other.
I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round"
`` What fun ! we shall all try to get the prize ,"
said the bear.
Now , Mr.
Deer , you are to be umpire !"
`` He , he !"
answered the deer.
`` I will be umpire.
Now , Mr.
Monkey and Mr.
Hare , if you are both ready , please walk out and take your places on the platform"
Then the monkey and the hare both hopped out , quickly and nimbly , to the wrestling platform.
The deer , as umpire , stood between the two and called out : `` Red-back ! Red-back !"
-LRB- this to the monkey , who has a red back in Japan -RRB-.
`` Are you ready ?"
Then he turned to the hare : `` Long-ears ! Long-ears ! are you ready ?"
Both the little wrestlers faced each other while the deer raised a leaf on high as signal.
`` Red-back ! Red-back ! stand your ground !"
called out the deer.
`` Long-ears ! Long-ears ! be strong , be strong -- do n't let the monkey beat you !"
grunted the bear.
The hare at last gained on the monkey.
`` Oh , oh ! how my back hurts -- my back hurts me !"
for he felt that he had not been fairly beaten.
My foot slipped and I tumbled.
Please give me another chance and let the hare wrestle with me for another round"
Then person_0 consenting , the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again.
This he soon managed to do.
The bear came forward as umpire.
At last person_0 got up and said : `` This is enough for to-day.
What a nice place we have found for wrestling ; let us come again to-morrow.
Now , we will all go home.
Come along !"
So saying , person_0 led the way while the animals followed.
person_0 and his four furry friends stood and looked about for some means of crossing.
Bridge there was none.
The river rushed `` don , don"
on its way.
person_0 , however , said : `` Wait a moment.
I will make a good bridge for you all in a few minutes"
person_0 went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank.
-LRB- crash , crash -RRB- , over fell the tree , forming an excellent bridge across the stream.
`` There ,"
and he stepped across first.
The four animals followed.
He watched with great surprise person_0 and his animal companions.
Whose son can he be ? I will find out before this day is done"
He hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them.
person_0 knew nothing of all this , and little guessed that he was being followed.
`` O , Kimbo !"
`` How late you are to-day.
I feared that something had happened to you.
Where have you been all the time ?"
We all enjoyed the sport , and are going to the same place to-morrow to have another match"
`` Now tell me who is the strongest of all ?"
asked his mother , pretending not to know.
`` Oh , mother ,"
`` But next to you then , who is the strongest ?"
`` The bear comes next to me in strength ,"
answered person_0.
`` And after the bear ?"
asked his mother again.
said person_0.
Suddenly person_0 and his mother were startled by a voice from outside.
He would like to join the sport too !"
It was the old woodcutter who had followed person_0 from the river.
He slipped off his clogs and entered the cottage.
Yama-uba and her son were both taken by surprise.
`` Who are you ?"
they both exclaimed.
Then person_0 and the woodcutter both put out their right arms and grasped each other 's hands.
At last the old man desisted , declaring it a drawn game.
`` You are , indeed , a very strong child.
There are few men who can boast of the strength of my right arm !"
said the woodcutter.
Hardly able to believe what I saw I followed you home.
Your strength of arm , which I have just tried , proves what I saw this afternoon.
When you are full-grown you will surely be the strongest man in all Japan.
It is a pity that you are hidden away in these wild mountains"
`` You are very kind to take so much interest in my son"
`` You need not trouble yourself about that.
My name is Sadamitsu , and I am a vassal of the powerful Lord Minamoto-no - Raiko.
I thought that I could best do this by assuming the disguise of a woodcutter.
By good fortune , I have thus unexpectedly come across your son.
What do you say to this ?"
As the kind general gradually unfolded his plan the mother 's heart was filled with a great joy.
person_0 had all this time been sitting by his mother 's side listening to what they said.
Long , long ago.
Now the hare wanted very much to cross over to Inaba.
and day after day he hoped to find some way of getting across.
`` This is very lucky !"
thought the hare.
`` Now I shall be able to get my wish.
I will ask the crocodile to carry me across the sea !"
But he was doubtful whether the crocodile would consent to do what wanted.
So with a loud voice he called to the crocodile , and said : `` Oh , Mr.
Crocodile , is n't it a lovely day ?"
The crocodile swam nearer the shore , very pleased to hear some one speak.
`` I wonder who it was that spoke to me just now ! Was it you , Mr.
Hare ? You must be very lonely all by yourself !"
`` Oh , no , I am not at all lonely ,"
Wo n't you stop and play with me a little while ?"
Then the hare said : `` Mr.
Tell me , do you think the number of your company is greater than mine ?"
`` Of course , there are more crocodiles than hares ,"
answered the crocodile.
The crocodile was very conceited.
The crocodile thought for a moment and then answered : `` Of course , it is possible"
`` Then do try ,"
said the artful hare , `` and I will count the number from here !"
The crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time.
The hare , meanwhile , waited patiently on the shore.
At last the crocodile appeared , bringing with him a large number of other crocodiles.
`` Look , Mr.
Hare !"
There are enough crocodiles to stretch from here even as far as China or India.
Did you ever see so many crocodiles ?"
One , two , three , four , five , six.
seven , eight , nine --"
Thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of Inaba.
And he was just about to run away as fast as he could.
So some of them ran after the hare and caught him.
Then they all surrounded the poop little animal and pulled out all his fur.
Now one of these young men had a bad and spiteful disposition.
Go and bathe yourself in the sea , and then come and sit in the wind.
This will make your fur grow again , and you will be just as you were before"
Then all the young men passed on.
The hare was very pleased , thinking that he had found a cure.
Just then another King 's son passed by , carrying a great bag on his back.
He saw the hare , and stopped and asked why he was crying so loudly.
Who can have treated you so cruelly ?"
`` I know ,"
`` Then I will tell you of a good remedy ,"
said the man.
The hare was very glad to be told what to do , so kindly.
Please tell me who you are ?"
`` I am no King 's son as you think me.
I am a fairy , and my name is Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto ,"
answered the man , `` and those beings who passed here before me are my brothers.
`` Oh , I did not know that you were Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto.
He found them just entering the Princess 's gate.
and so they were married.
This is the end of the story.
But what became of the crocodiles nobody knows"
And after the King had promised her this she closed her eyes and died.
So the messengers came home as they went.
And as she was tired , she got into a hollow tree , and fell asleep.
Then it so happened that the King to whom this forest belonged , was hunting in it.
When his dogs came to the tree , they sniffed , and ran barking round about it.
Its skin is fur of a thousand different kinds , but it is lying asleep"
So they put her in the carriage , and took her home to the royal palace.
Allerleirauh lived there for a long time in great wretchedness.
Then he ordered the cook to appear before him.
The King said , `` Go and bid it come up here"
When Allerleirauh came , the King said , `` Who art thou ?"
`` I am a poor girl who no longer has any father or mother"
He asked further , `` Of what use art thou in my palace ?"
She answered , `` I am good for nothing but to have boots thrown at my head"
He continued , `` Where didst thou get the ring which was in the soup ?"
She answered , `` I know nothing about the ring"
So the King could learn nothing , and had to send her away again.
but as she begged so hard , he let her go up at the appointed time.
The King clutched the mantle and tore it off.
Thereupon the marriage was solemnized , and they lived happily until their death"
One day as the sun was setting , a priest came to the plain.
He exclaimed with joy : `` Oh.
surely that is some cottage where I can get a night 's lodging !"
I beg you to be good enough to let me spend the night under your roof"
`` I am very sorry for you.
`` Oh , that does not matter ,"
And in this way he pressed the old woman to let him stay.
The pilgrim was only too glad to do as he was told.
He took off his sandals and entered the hut.
`` You must be hungry after your long tramp ,"
said the old woman.
`` I will go and cook some supper for you"
She then went to the kitchen to cook some rice.
`` I see you are cold ,"
You must stay and take care of the house while I am gone"
`` No , no ,"
Then she left him and went out.
Now mind what I tell you !"
`` If you tell me not to go near the back room , of course I wo n't ,"
said the priest , rather bewildered.
The old woman then went out again , and the priest was left alone.
aroused his curiosity and his fear.
He got up and began to move slowly towards the back room.
He must find out.
`` She will not know that I have looked unless I tell her.
I will just have a peep before she comes back ,"
said the man to himself.
With trembling hands he pushed back the sliding door and looked in.
What he saw froze the blood in his veins.
The sickening smell made him faint.
`` How horrible !"
he cried out.
He ran on , redoubling his speed , pretending not to hear.
`` Stop ! stop , you wicked man , why did you look into the forbidden room ?"
The priest quite forgot how tired he was and his feet flew over the ground faster than ever.
With all his heart he repeated the prayer to Buddha : `` Namu Amida Butsu , Namu Amida Butsu"
Now in a certain place there lived a Brahman named Haridatta.
He was a farmer , but poor was the return his labor brought him.
Suddenly he saw a great hooded snake creeping out of an ant-hill near at hand.
That 's why my farming is in vain.
I will at once go and pay my respects to it"
That is why I have not yet paid my respects to you ; pray forgive me"
And he laid the milk down and went to his house.
The son brought the milk , put it down , and went back home.
His people raised him a funeral pyre not far from the field and burnt him to ashes.
` Tis greed that brings you here , and makes you even forget the loss of your son.
From this time forward friendship between us is impossible.
Your son struck me in youthful ignorance , and I have bitten him to death.
So speaking , it gave the Brahman a costly pearl and disappeared.
But before it went away it said : `` Come back no more"
The Brahman took the pearl , and went back home , cursing the folly of his son"
THE worst of ills , with jealousy compared , Are trifling torments ev ` ry where declared.
Were this misfortune viewed with proper eyes , Such ills from cuckoldom would ne'er arise.
Whence this conclusion must directly spring : To be a cuckold is a useful thing.
From convents , heiresses are often led Directly to the altar to be wed.
.
SOME time the father had the girl declared His lawful child , who all his fondness shared.
But better still , our couple 's chief delight , Was mutual love and pleasure to excite.
WHAT should a husband do whose wife is sought , With anxious fondness by another ? Naught.
Our swain his marriage vow to this opposed ; At which th ' enchantress much surprise disclosed.
Domestick joys should be to cits confined ; For none but such were scenes like those designed.
CALISTA saw the flatt ` ring lover 's scheme ; And turned to ridicule the wily theme.
She turned coquette ; restraints the FAIR awake , And only prompt more liberties to take.
AT length , the wife a lucky moment sought , When Damon seemed by soft caresses caught.
Just hear what the wind can tell.
Huh -- uh -- ush ! roar along ! That is the burden of the song.
says the person_0.
` It _ shall _ be done , ' he was accustomed to say.
`` His wife walked proudly in gold-embroidered garments over the polished marble floors.
The tapestries were gorgeous , the furniture was expensive and artistically carved.
Black fiery horses neighed in the stables.
`` They were rich people , noble people , born in affluence , nurtured in affluence.
`` Huh -- sh ! roar along !"
said the person_0.
`` And it was just on the evening of the first day of May ,"
the person_0 continued.
`` I lay quite quiet ,"
They rode that summer through all the villages round about.
But in the night , when I rose again ,"
`` Waldemar Daa stood for a space silent and thoughtful.
` The proudest tree can be bowed without being broken , ' said a voice within him.
said the person_0.
Crows and ravens croaked aloud as if in scorn.
Therefore the tree with the black stork 's nest was left standing.
The tree was not worth speaking of.
`` There was a great hewing and sawing , and a three-decker was built.
`` I heard all that ,"
said the person_0.
I let it hear my voice , that it might know what a storm has to say.
Certainly I did my part towards teaching it seamanship.
`` Her sister was bright and slender as a lily.
Joanna had height and deportment , but was like her mother , rather stiff in the stalk.
They were handsome women.
That was no secret , and many opinions were expressed concerning it.
In his chimney there was fire even in summer time.
`` That is why the chimney was always smoking , therefore the flames crackled so frequently.
Yes , I was there too ,"
said the person_0.
`` Empty grew the barns and store-rooms , the cellars and magazines.
The servants decreased in number , and the mice multiplied.
said the person_0"
` Where the chimney smokes the meal is being cooked , ' the proverb says.
`` I blew through the courtyard-gate like a watchman blowing his horn ,"
the person_0 went on , `` but no watchman was there.
I sung through the burst window-panes and the yawning clefts in the walls.
That was not the song that had been sung at the children 's cradle.
The lordly life had changed to a life of penury.
I was the only one who rejoiced aloud in that castle ,"
said the person_0.
`` I snowed them up , and they say snow keeps people warm.
It was a biting frost.
` After winter comes spring , ' he said.
` Thou cunning little weaver , thou dost teach me perseverance.
Let them tear thy web , and thou wilt begin it again , and complete it.
' `` It was the morning of Easter-day.
The bells sounded from the neighbouring church , and the sun seemed to rejoice in the sky.
The lamp was burnt out , but he did not notice it.
He stood straight up , and held his costly treasure on high , in the brittle glass.
Owe Rainel did not like staying there.
I listened to hear what occurred.
-LRB- Illustration : LEAVING THE OLD HOME.
`` Ida walked on one side of the old man , and Anna Dorothea on the other.
Joanna turned round at the entrance -- why ? Fortune would not turn because she did so.
And forth they went to the far-off land.
`` Daa and his daughters could not help hearing it.
She lived longer than the rest ; she knew all.
said the person_0.
She remembered all that right well , did Anna Dorothea"
` Oh ! oh ! '"
Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant.
`` I took pity on the fairest of the sisters ,"
said the person_0.
She was sparing of words , and of a dark countenance , but willing at her work.
said the person_0.
`` There was no window , only a hole in the wall.
The sun rose up like a mass of gold , and looked through.
`` The stork covered her hut till her death.

OUR Roman , having satisfied his eyes , At length withdrew , confounded by surprise.
To those , from whom just credence I receive , Their tales I promise fully to believe.
On hearing this the rustick lad proposed , To visit her when others ' eyes were closed.
It was quite late in the fall , and the weather had grown very cold.
Mrs.
So Mrs.
Coon decided to take him with her.
The hunting was not very good.
There were no birds ' eggs at all to be found in the trees.
And as for corn -- Farmer Green had long ago gathered the last ear of it.
person_0 wished that it was summertime.
Now , person_0 did not always mind his mother as quickly as he might have.
That was enough for person_0.
He scrambled up the nearest tree.
For he knew that his mother had discovered danger of some sort.
Mrs.
Coon followed close behind person_0.
And they had.
no sooner hidden in the branches than person_0 saw what it was that his mother had smelled.
It was Johnnie Green ! He passed right underneath the tree where they were perched.
And as Mrs.
`` What 's the matter ?"
he asked , as soon as Johnnie Green was out of sight.
`` His cap !"
Mrs.
Coon exclaimed.
`` He is wearing a coon-skin cap !"
she warned person_0.
`` No , indeed , Mother !"
person_0 was quite sure that such an adventure would n't please him at all.
We shall see how well person_0 remembered.
That very afternoon person_0 Coon heard some very pleasant news.
It was Jasper Jay who told him.
Jasper Jay was a very noisy blue jay who lived in the neighborhood.
He did not go south with most of the other birds when the cold weather came.
He was a very noisy fellow.
It was there that Jasper Jay found him and told him the pleasant news.
And person_0 was very glad to hear the news , because he was still hungry.
`` If I liked turkeys I would certainly go down there some night and get one ,"
said Jasper Jay"
The children ran about it , and caught each other , and played at counting out.
`` Eneke Beneke , let me live , And I to thee my bird will give.
The pretty cow shall give me milk , The milk I 'll to the baker take.
The baker he shall bake a cake , The cake I 'll give unto the cat.
Thus passed a long time , and then strangers came as visitors to the castle.
The false step-mother thought , `` This is a good opportunity ,"
Then said he , `` Be easy , I will not kill thee ,"
She had about seven thousand cages of rare birds in the castle.
She and a handsome youth named Joringel had promised to marry each other.
They were still in the days of betrothal , and their greatest happiness was being together.
`` Take care ,"
said Joringel , `` that you do not go too near the castle"
Jorinda wept now and then : she sat down in the sunshine and was sorrowful.
Joringel was sorrowful too ; they were as sad as if they were about to die.
The sun was still half above the mountain and half set.
Joringel looked through the bushes , and saw the old walls of the castle close at hand.
He was horror-stricken and filled with deadly fear.
Joringel looked for Jorinda.
She was changed into a nightingale , and sang , `` jug , jug , jug"
The sun had now set.
She muttered to herself , caught the nightingale , and took it away in her hand.
Joringel could neither speak nor move from the spot ; the nightingale was gone.
If the moon shines on the cage , Zachiel , let him loose at once"
Then Joringel was freed.
He often walked round and round the castle , but not too near to it.
In the middle of it there was a large dew-drop , as big as the finest pearl.
Day and night he journeyed with this flower to the castle.
He walked in through the courtyard , and listened for the sound of the birds.
At last he heard it.
`` Just go , Frederick ,"
answered Kate , `` just go , I will have all ready for you"
Well thought of"
`` What 's gone is gone !"
As soon as Kate was on the steps she saw the mischance.
`` Good gracious !"
she cried.
`` What shall I do now to stop Frederick knowing it !"
`` Yes ,"
`` It is all right ,"
said Kate , `` where the one is the other ought to be also ,"
and she strewed the meal over the whole cellar.
At mid-day home came Frederick : `` Now , wife , what have you ready for me ?"
`` Ah , Freddy ,"
`` Indeed , Frederick , I did not know that , you should have told me"
The man thought , `` If my wife is like this , I must look after things more"
Said she , `` Oh , no , Frederick , I certainly will not go"
`` Yellow counters , why not ? But just let us see them"
I am not allowed to go there"
The rogues went thither , dug and found pure gold.
`` I have bought them , Frederick , for the counters which were under the cow 's manger.
I did not go there myself , the pedlars had to dig them out for themselves"
`` Ah , wife ,"
`` Indeed , Frederick ,"
said she , `` I did not know that , you should have forewarned me"
`` Come , then ,"
`` Yes , Frederick , I will take them"
They set out , and as Frederick was the better walker , Catherine followed him.
`` It is to my advantage ,"
thought she , `` when we turn back I shall be a little way in advance"
Then she came to a hill where there were deep ruts on both sides of the road.
`` There one can see ,"
So she took another cheese and rolled it down.
But the cheeses did not come back , so she let a third run down , thinking.
`` Perhaps they are waiting for company , and do not like to walk alone"
But the fourth did no better than the third.
`` Now just let us have what you have brought with you ,"
said he.
She gave him the dry bread.
`` Where have you the butter and the cheeses ?"
asked the man.
`` Ah , Freddy ,"
`` Really , Frederick , you should have told me"
`` No , Frederick , you should have told me to do it before"
I will wait here for you"
`` Oh , heavens ,"
And now they went into the forest , and sought the rogues , but did not find them.
Frederick got down on the other side and collected some stones together.
`` No , Catherine , not now ,"
he replied , `` they might betray us"
`` Oh , but , Frederick , I must ! They weigh me down far too much"
`` Do it , then , and be hanged !"
`` No , Catherine , you must not , it might betray us"
`` Ah , but , Frederick , I must , it weighs me down far too much"
`` Then do it and be hanged !"
So she emptied out the vinegar , and it besprinkled the robbers.
They said amongst themselves , `` The dew is already falling"
At length Catherine thought , `` Can it really be the door which weighs me down so ?"
and said , `` Frederick , I must throw the door down"
`` No , not now , Catherine , it might discover us"
`` Oh , but , Frederick , I must.
It weighs me down far too much"
`` Oh , no , Catherine , do hold it fast"
`` Ah , Frederick , I am letting it fall !"
`` Let it go , then , in the devil 's name"
and they ran away and left everything behind them.
`` What is the matter ?"
`` I should very much like to know if Catherine is in ?"
`` Yes , yes ,"
replied Frederick , `` she must be in and asleep"
Said she ,"
` Tis well , then I am certainly at home already ,"
and ran away.
Outside Catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal.
Then she went to them and said , `` I will help you to steal"
The rascals thought that she knew the situation of the place , and were willing.
The thieves thought to themselves , `` That 's a fine way of doing things ,"
and wished themselves once more rid of Catherine.
Go there and pull up some turnips for us"
He ran away into the village to the pastor , and said , `` Mr.
Pastor , the devil is in your turnip-ground , rooting up turnips"
`` Ah , heavens ,"
Said the man , `` Then I will carry you on my back ,"
and he carried him out on his back.
And when they came to the ground , Catherine arose and stood up her full height.
`` Ah , the devil !"
Seven Swabians were once together.
`` Hark ! hark !"
cried he to his comrades , `` Good heavens ! I hear a drum"
`` Oh dear ! Oh dear !"
screamed Master person_0.
`` Take me prisoner ; I surrender ! I surrender !"
Then they journeyed onwards.
The second danger which they survived can not be compared with the first.
Her ears were standing straight up , and her great glassy eyes were wide open.
So they said , `` We must go through a great and dangerous struggle.
Boldly ventured , is half won ,"
and all seven grasped the spear , Master person_0 in front , and Veitli behind.
Hereupon they all together set on the dragon.
in the greatest anguish.
This awakened the hare , which in great alarm darted swiftly away.
in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves.
Master person_0 thought he was saying , `` Wade , wade through the water ,"
and as he was the first , began to set out and went into the moselle.
THOSE who in fables deal , bestow at ease Both names and titles , freely as they please.
It costs them scarcely any thing , we find.

THE favors Anne reserved he thought his own , Though expectations oft away have flown.
WHEN Easter came , new difficulties rose Then , in confession , ALL she should disclose.
At present love is little more than name : In matrimony , gold 's the only aim.
But when four months had passed , the fair-one showed.
On this the son-in-law the bond received , And , with a bow , departed much relieved.

Kitty could No moment steal , do what she would , To see her Richard.
Sorely vexed She was , and he still more perplexed.
Bread butterless , a sanded floor , It seemed no better.
And thus it came about.
One day By chance they met , alone , away From jealous parents.
`` What 's the use ;"
`` If you will please me ,"
This is not strange.
A flea is in her ear , ` tis said.
The morning broke.
Of fleas and heat Kitty complained.
she said ,"
Ready consent The simple mother gave , and went To seek her spouse.
`` Wife ,"
`` She must remain.
No doubt to-night `` Will fresher be.
I sleep all right `` In spite of heat , and so can she.
`` Is she more delicate than me ?"
`` Our Kate `` To me seems greatly changed of late.
`` You are unkind ,"
she said to him , `` To thwart her simple , girlish whim.
`` You do not love your child , and will `` With your unkindness make her ill"
`` Pray cease ,"
the husband cried , `` to scold `` And take your whim.
`` Her belly-full our Kate may get `` Of nightingale or of linnet"
The thing was settled.
Kate obeyed , And in a trice her bed was made , And lover signalled.
To understand there 's but one way -- Experience.
`` I 'll see the influence ,"
he said , `` Of nightingale and change of bed"
Excessive heat had made all clothes Unbearable.
The mother almost wept for glee.
`` A nightingale , oh ! let me see.
Despite his grief the good man smiled.
`` Much more than you expect you 'll see.
Who was surprised ? It was the dame.
`` For their good offices I wait `` To set this nasty matter straight"
`` All will go well ,"
They wrote , they signed , the sealed -- and thus The wedding ended free from fuss.
They left the happy couple there.
Adam dug up the land , and Eve span.
Then she brought in her children , but only the beautiful ones.
The ugly children were , however , not to let themselves be seen.
She had scarcely got ready , before there was a knock at the house-door.
Adam looked through a chink , and saw that it was the Lord.
Adam opened the door respectfully , and the Heavenly Father entered.
and to the second , `` Thou a prince ,"
to the third , `` Thou a count ,"
to the fourth , `` Thou a knight ,"
to the fifth , `` Thou a nobleman ,"

to the eighth , `` Thou a learned man"
He bestowed upon them also all his richest blessings.
Then came the whole coarse , dirty , shabby , sooty band.
The Lord smiled , looked at them all , and said , `` I will bless these also"
to the second , `` Thou a fisherman ,"
to the third , `` Thou a smith ,"

One day Fatty Coon was strolling along the brook which flowed not far from his home.
It was a bug , or a huge fly.
And Fatty was very fond of bugs -- to eat , you know.
So he lost no time.
The bright thing had scarcely settled on the water when Fatty reached out and seized it.
He put it into his mouth , when the strangest thing happened.
Fatty felt himself pulled right over into the water.
Something pricked his cheek and Fatty thought that the bright thing had stung him.
He tried to take it out of his mouth , and he was surprised again.
Whatever the thing was , it seemed to be stuck fast in his mouth.
And all the time Fatty was being dragged along through the water.
He began to be frightened.
At least , that was what Fatty Coon thought.
And he swam quickly to the bank and scampered into the bushes.
Now , this was what really happened.
Farmer Green had come up the brook to catch trout.
He had stolen along the brook very quietly , so that he would n't frighten the fish.
And he had made so little noise that Fatty Coon never heard him at all.
Farmer Green had not seen Fatty , crouched as he was among the stones.
But Fatty Coon did n't laugh at all.
His mouth was too sore ; and he was too frightened.
But he was very , very glad that the strange bug had flown away"
It is more than a hundred years ago.
Behind the wood , by the great lake , stood the old baronial mansion.
Round about it lay a deep moat , in which grew reeds and grass.
`` Everything in its place ,"
he cried ; `` into the puddle with you !"
`` Everything in its right place ,"
can not always be managed , and therefore he stuck the piece in the ground.
`` Grow and prosper till you can furnish a good flute for them up yonder ,"
he said ; for he would have liked to play the `` rogue 's march"
for my lord the baron , and my lord 's whole family.
They had the pedlar summoned upstairs , but only to make fun of him.
The wine had mounted into their heads , and the sense had flown out.
`` Everything in its right place !"
`` The open high-road is my right place ,"
he said ; `` I did not feel at all happy there"
But from that hour no more card-playing was permitted there.
`` That is bad reading ,"
It was a good thing now to be in the old mansion.
Where rectitude enters in , prosperity is sure to follow.
The old house was cleaned and painted , the ditches were cleared and fruit trees planted.
Everything wore a bright cheerful look , and the floors were as polished as a draught board.
`` That is our genealogical tree ,"
And a hundred years rolled by.
It was in our own time.
The lake had been converted to moorland , and the old mansion had almost disappeared.
A field-path led close by the old tree.
All things here corresponded with each other.
The motto was still `` Everything in its right place ;"
The pictures represented the Councillor of Justice and his lady , the founders of the present family.
`` But they did not properly belong to our family ,"
said one of the little barons.
`` He was a dealer , and she had kept the geese.
They were not like papa and mamma"
the great-grandmother and great-grandfather had been sent into the passage that led to the servants ' hall.
The son of the neighbouring clergyman was tutor in the great house.
and the flowers formed a pretty whole.
The party came to a halt at the old willow tree.
Accordingly the tutor broke off a branch.
`` Oh , do n't do that !"
cried the young baroness ; but it was done already.
`` That is our famous old tree ,"
she continued , `` and I love it dearly.
They laugh at me at home for this , but I do n't mind.
There is a story attached to this tree"
`` They would not be ennobled , the good old folks !"
she said.
`` They were charming , sensible people ,"
said the clergyman 's son ; and with this the conversation naturally fell upon nobles and citizens.
But that is not my view , for I consider it entirely false.
In the higher classes many beautiful and kindly traits are found.
My mother told me one of this kind , and I could tell you many others.
`` My mother was on a visit to a great family in town.
My grandmother , I think , had been housekeeper to the count 's mother.
Indeed , she was accustomed to come every Sunday , and carry away a gift with her.
This was the speech of the clergyman 's son.
It was certainly rather long , but then the flute was being finished while he made it.
At the castle there was a great company.
Many guests came from the neighborhood and from the capital.
said a cavalier -- his father 's son and nothing else -- to the tutor.
`` You play the flute and make it too -- that 's genius.
That should command , and should have the place of honor !"
`` No indeed ,"
`` Oh , you will enchant us with the little instrument , will you not ?"
`` Everything in its right place"
`` Everything in its right place"
And to that it will come ; for _ hereafter _ is long -- longer than this story"
An old story yet lives of the `` Thorny Road of Honour ,"

would die of hunger.
Now , a costly monument marks the grave of Camoens.
There is a new picture.
Behind the iron grating a man appears , pale as death , with long unkempt beard.
`` I have made a discovery ,"
`` Who is the man ? `` A madman ,"
replies the keeper of the madhouse.
_ Yet _ it moves !"
Yes , and a future century jeers at the white lily.
Voltaire , the satyr of human intellect , writes"
_ La Pucelle _"
With his finger he marks out a groove in the stone table.
Enemies wrote his history.
It is Tycho Brahe.
He is going to a strange country.
`` The vault of heaven is above me everywhere ,"
he says , `` and what do I want more ?"
`` Ay , free , if only from the unbearable sufferings of the body !"
comes in a sigh through time , and strikes upon our ear.
What a picture ! Griffenfeldt , a Danish Prometheus , bound to the rocky island of Munkholm.
The ship begins its passage , but suddenly it stops.
`` Conceit ! Foolery !"
is the cry.
`` It has happened just as he deserved : put the crack-brain under lock and key !"
The she-wolf brought forth a young one , and invited the fox to be godfather.
`` After all , he is a near relative of ours ,"
The fox , too , appeared quite honest , and said , `` Worthy Mrs.
He enjoyed himself at the feast , and made merry ; afterwards he said , `` Dear Mrs.
I know a sheep-fold from which we might fetch a nice morsel"
The wolf was pleased with the ditty , and she went out with the fox to the farm-yard.
The she-wolf crept into the stable.
At last she escaped , and dragged herself outside.

Heavy clouds obscured the sky , and the Moon did not make his appearance at all.
Yes , he has had an experience indeed.
He saw the captive giant at St.
Ah ! what tales the Moon can tell.
Human life is like a story to him.
To-night I shall not see thee again , old friend.
To-night I can draw no picture of the memories of thy visit.
And , as I looked dreamily towards the clouds , the sky became bright.
There was a glancing light , and a beam from the Moon fell upon me.
A disbanded soldier had nothing to live on , and did not know how to get on.
The little man said to him , `` What ails you , you seem so very sorrowful ?"
Then the soldier said , `` I am hungry , but have no money"
The soldier said , `` All right , if there is no help for it ,"
and went off with the little man , who straightway led him down into hell.
Then he told him what he had to do.
The soldier said , `` Good , I will take care"
`` Aha , old bird !"
and he quickly let the lid fall , poked the fire , and added a fresh log.
He closed the lid again , and fetched yet another log to make it really hot.
And he fetched the bellows and made hell-fire blaze right under him.
`` Yes ,"
said the soldier , `` I should very much like to see what my father is doing at home"
`` I should never have expected that ,"
said he , and was well pleased , and entered the town.
He called to him and asked , `` Whence comest thou ?"
`` From hell"
`` Who art thou ?"
`` The Devil 's sooty brother , and my King as well"
Then like a father-confessor he dressed , And took his seat where priests their flock confessed.
And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears.
The young wife scolded him , but he said nothing and only sighed.
`` What are you doing there ?"
asked the father.
`` I am making a little trough ,"
answered the child , `` for father and mother to eat out of when I am big"
The man and his wife looked at each other for a while , and presently began to cry.
The mother was afraid when she heard that , and wept no more.
`` Yes ,"
said the fox , `` that is reasonable , and a pious request.
Pray away , I will wait till you are done"
Then the first began a good long prayer , for ever saying , `` Ga ! Ga !"
The third and fourth followed her , and soon they were all cackling together.
And then I had not a single friend ; not one familiar face greeted me.
In , fact it was the MOON that looked in upon me.
This promise he has faithfully kept.
It is a pity that he can only stay such a short time when he comes.
`` Just paint the scenes I describe to you"
-- this is what he said to me -- `` and you will have a very pretty picture-book"
I have followed his injunction for many evenings.
I could make up a new `` Thousand and One Nights ,"
ONE morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.
He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot , trit-trot of a pony.
A gig was coming along the road ; it was driven by person_1.
Mcperson_0 , and beside him sat person_1s.
Mcperson_0 in her best bonnet.
Mcperson_0 's garden.
Old person_1s.
LITTLE Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.
PETER was sitting by himself.
He looked poorly , and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.
`` Peter ,"
-- said little Benjamin , in a whisper -- `` who has got your clothes ?"
PETER replied -- `` The scarecrow in person_1.
Mcperson_0 's garden ,"
and described how he had been chased about the garden , and had dropped his shoes and coat.
Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin , and assured him that person_1.
Mcperson_0 had gone out in a gig , and person_1s.
Mcperson_0 also ; and certainly for the day , because she was wearing her best bonnet.
PETER said he hoped that it would rain.
At this point , old person_1s.
Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.
From here they looked down into person_1.
Mcperson_0 's garden.
Mcperson_0 's.
IT had been sown with lettuces.
They took them off the scarecrow.
Benjamin tried on the tam - o-shanter , but it was too big for him.
Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself ; he kept hearing noises.
BENJAMIN , on the contrary , was perfectly at home , and ate a lettuce leaf.
-LRB- The name of little Benjamin 's papa was old person_1.
Benjamin Bunny.
-RRB- The lettuces certainly were very fine.
PETER did not eat anything ; he said he should like to go home.
Presently he dropped half the onions.
He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden.
They went along a little walk on planks , under a sunny red - brick wall.
PRESENTLY Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.
THE cat got up and stretched herself , and came and sniffed at the basket.
SHE sat there for FIVE HOURS.
The cat looked up and saw old person_1.
Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.
He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco , and had a little switch in his hand.
He was looking for his son.
OLD person_1.
Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.
The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
WHEN old person_1.
Bunny had driven the cat into the green-house , he locked the door.
Then he took out his nephew Peter.
THEN he took out the handkerchief of onions , and marched out of the garden.
When person_1.
Mcperson_0 returned about half an hour later , he observed several things which perplexed him.
Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket - handkerchief , and old person_1s.
Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling , with the rabbit-tobacco.
The End"
ONCE upon a time there was a little fat comfortable gray squirrel , called person_0.
`` Then we shall wake up all the thinner , when there is nothing to eat in spring-time ,"
replied prudent Timothy.
EVERY day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts.
`` How shall you ever get them out again ? It is like a money-box !"
said Goody.
`` I shall be much thinner before spring-time , my love ,"
said person_0 , peeping into the hole.
The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail.
He began to dig , and he could not remember.
There were several sorts of little birds , twittering different songs.
And another sang -- `` Little bita bread and-NO-cheese ! Little bit-a-bread an ' - NO - cheese !"
THE squirrels followed and listened.
It was only singing its natural song , and it meant nothing at all.
The hole was much too small for person_0 ' figure.
They squeezed him dreadfully , it was a wonder they did not break his ribs.
`` We will leave him here till he confesses ,"
said Silvertail Squirrel , and he shouted into the hole -- `` Who 's - been-digging-up MY-nuts ?"
He lay quite stunned and still.
GOODY TIPTOES picked up the nut bags and went home.
Goody person_1 passed a lonely and unhappy night.
IN the meantime person_0 came to his senses.
person_0 coughed and groaned , because his ribs hurted him.
It laughed and chuckled when it heard person_0 's story.
`` Just another nut -- or two nuts ; let me crack them for you ,"
said the Chipmunk.
person_0 grew fatter and fatter ! NOW Goody person_1 had set to work again by herself.
She hid them under a tree root ; they rattled down , down , down.
What is the explanation of these showers of nuts ?"
`` I am sure I beg your pardon ; I did not not know that anybody lived here ,"
said Mrs.
`` I know where Chippy is ; a little bird told me ,"
said Mrs.
Chippy Hackee.
SHE led the way to the woodpecker 's tree , and they listened at the hole.
`` You could squeeze in , through that little round hole ,"
said Goody person_1.
`` Yes , I could ,"
said the Chipmunk , `` but my husband , Chippy Hackee , bites !"
And person_0 replied , `` Is that you , Goody person_1 ? Why , certainly !"
Then person_0 came out , and went home with an umbrella.
BUT Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week , although it was uncomfortable.
AT last a large bear came walking through the wood.
Perhaps he also was looking for nuts ; he seemed to be sniffing around.
And now person_0 and Goody person_1 keep their nut-store fastened up with a little padlock.
But nobody ever answers ! The End"
`` NOW , my dears ,"
said old Mrs.
Mcperson_0"
`` NOW run along , and do n't get into mischief.
I am going out"
THEN old Mrs.
Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella , to the baker 's.
She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
BUT round the end of a cucumber frame , whom should he meet but Mr.
Mcperson_0 ! MR.
He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages , and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.
It was a blue jacket with brass buttons , quite new.
MR.
AND rushed into the toolshed , and jumped into a can.
MR.
McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed , perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot.
He began to turn them over carefully , looking under each.
Presently Peter sneezed -- `` Kertyschoo !"
Mr.
The window was too small for Mr.
Mcperson_0 , and he was tired of running after Peter.
He went back to his work.
Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.
She only shook her head at him.
Peter began to cry.
Presently , he came to a pond where Mr.
Mcperson_0 filled his water-cans.
Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.
The first thing he saw was Mr.
Mcperson_0 hoeing onions.
Mr.
Mcperson_0 caught sight of him at the corner , but Peter did not care.
He slipped underneath the gate , and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.
MR.
McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.
PETER never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.
His mother was busy cooking ; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.
BUT Flopsy , Mopsy , and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries , for supper.
The End"
They would not come off the plates , but they were extremely beautiful.
ONE morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll 's perambulator.
There was no one in the nursery , and it was very quiet.
Tom person_1 put out his head for a moment , and then popped it in again.
Tom person_1 was a mouse.
THE doll 's house stood at the other side of the fireplace.
Tom person_1 and Hunca person_0 went cautiously across the hearth-rug.
They pushed the front door -- it was not fast.
TOM THUMB and Hunca person_0 went up-stairs and peeped into the dining - room.
It was a beautiful shiny yellow , streaked with red.
The knife crumpled up and hurt him ; he put his finger in his mouth.
`` It is not boiled enough ; it is hard.
You have a try , Hunca person_0"
HUNCA MUNCA stood up in her chair , and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.
`` It 's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger 's ,"
said Hunca person_0.
THE ham broke off the plate with a jerk , and rolled under the table.
`` Let it alone ,"
said Tom person_1 ; `` give me some fish , Hunca person_0 !"
HUNCA MUNCA tried every tin spoon in turn ; the fish was glued to the dish.
Then Tom person_1 lost his temper.
They broke up the pudding , the lobsters , the pears , and the oranges.
WHILE Tom person_1 was up the chimney , Hunca person_0 had another disappointment.
She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser , labeled `` Rice ,"
`` Coffee"
`` Sago"
; but when she turned them upside down there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.
But Hunca person_0 had a frugal mind.
WITH Tom person_1 's assistance she carried the bolster down-stairs and across the hearth-rug.
It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-hole ; but they managed it somehow.
The bookcase and the bird-cage refused to go into the mouse-hole.
HUNCA MUNCA left them behind the coal - box , and went to fetch a cradle.
The mice rushed back to their hole , and the dolls came into the nursery.
SHE also has some useful pots and pans , and several other things.
BUT the nurse said : `` I will set a mouse-trap !"
SO that is the story of the two Bad Mice.
For many many weeks there would now be a long night.
-- others only containing room enough to hold two or four men.
Before long some one knocked.
replied a smooth voice.
`` Honest indeed ,"
Thou wilt not get into heaven.
The Lord hath forbidden me to let any one in while he is out"
`` Come , do be merciful ,"
cried the tailor.
Only let me in , and I will do all the rough work.
He asked Saint Peter what had become of the stool , but he did not know.
Then he asked if he had let anyone come in.
`` I know of no one who has been here ,"
answered Peter , `` but a lame tailor , who is still sitting behind the door"
`` Oh , thou knave ,"
Henceforth thou canst stay no longer in heaven , but must go outside the door again.
Then go where thou wilt.
No one shall give punishment here , but I alone , the Lord"
where the good soldiers sit and make merry"
Here is true poetry in nature.
-LRB- Footnote 2 : Large mounds similar to the `` barrows"
found in Britain , are thus designated in Germany and the North.
`` First , two rich landed proprietors came driving by.
` Those are glorious trees ! ' said the first.
` The road here is wretched , ' observed another man who drove past.
The stage coach went rattling past.
All the passengers were asleep at this beautiful spot.
The postillion blew his horn , but he only thought , ` I can play capitally.
It sounds well here.
I wonder if those in there like it ? ' -- and the stage coach vanished.
Then two young fellows came gallopping up on horseback.
A carriage rolled by.
Six people were sitting in it.
' `` Now came a painter.
He spoke not a word , but his eyes sparkled.
He began to whistle.
At this the nightingales sang louder than ever.
` That will make a beautiful picture , ' he said.
And last of all came a poor girl.
Her pale handsome face was bent in a listening attitude towards the forest.
My rays followed her till the morning dawn kissed her brow"
The air was clear again.
Several evenings had passed , and the Moon was in the first quarter.
Again he gave me an outline for a sketch.
Listen to what he told me.
`` I have followed the polar bird and the swimming whale to the eastern coast of Greenland.
The blooming lychnis exhaled sweet odours.
The crown-shaped Northern Light burned fiercely in the sky.
`` And now a Court of Judgment was opened.
The defendant replied with satire as keen , while the audience laughed , and gave their verdict.
A hundred paces away , under the open tent of hides , lay a sick man.
` Yes , it is a pleasant summer tent , the sea , ' observed the wife.
`` THERE 'S one of my pocket-handkins !"
cried person_0 -- `` and there 's my pinny !"
person_1.
Tiggy-winkle ironed it , and goffered it , and shook out the frills.
`` Oh that IS lovely !"
said person_0.
`` AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves ?"
said person_1.
Tiggy - winkle.
`` WHY , there 's another handkersniff -- but it is n't mine ; it 's red ?"
`` Oh no , if you please 'm ; that one belongs to old person_1.
`` There 's another one of mine ,"
said person_0.
`` WHAT are those funny little white things ?"
`` There 's my last pocket - handkin !"
said person_0.
`` AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch ?"
`` They 're little dicky shirt - fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse -- most terrible particular !"
said person_1.
Tiggy-winkle.
`` Now I 've finished my ironing ; I 'm going to air some clothes"
`` WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things ?"
said person_0.
`` Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl"
`` Will their jackets take off ?"
asked Lucy.
`` Oh yes , if you please 'm ; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder.
And here 's one marked for Gatesgarth , and three that come from Little-town.
They 're ALWAYS marked at washing !"
said person_1.
Tiggy - winkle.
Tiggy-winkle made tea -- a cup for herself and a cup for person_0.
They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
person_1.
THEN away down the hill trotted person_0 and person_1.
Tiggy-winkle.
and to thank the washer-woman -- But what a VERY odd thing ! person_1.
Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG.
Tiggy-winkle ! -RRB-"
IT is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is `` soporific"
They had a large family , and they were very improvident and cheerful.
I do not remember the separate names of their children ; they were generally called the `` Flopsy Bunnies"
SOMETIMES Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.
Mcperson_0 's garden.
MR.
McGREGOR 'S rubbish heap was a mixture.
One day -- oh joy ! -- there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces , which had `` shot"
into flower.
THE Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces.
Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children.
THE little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun.
From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine.
-RRB- SHE rustled across the paper bag , and awakened Benjamin Bunny.
The mouse apologized profusely , and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.
The mouse hid in a jam pot.
They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.
Mr.
Mcperson_0 looked down after emptying his sack.
He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings.
He stared at them for some time.
PRESENTLY a fly settled on one of them and it moved.
Mr.
said he as he dropped them into his sack.
The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed.
They stirred a little in their sleep , but still they did not wake up.
MR.
McGREGOR tied up the sack and left it on the wall.
He went to put away the mowing machine.
WHILE he was gone , Mrs.
Flopsy Bunny -LRB- who had remained at home -RRB- came across the field.
Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair , they could not undo the string.
But Mrs.
Tittlemouse was a resourceful person.
She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.
THE little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.
THEN they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr.
Mcperson_0.
MR.
McGREGOR came back and picked up the sack , and carried it off.
He carried it hanging down , as if it were rather heavy.
The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.
THEY watched him go into his house.
And then they crept up to the window to listen.
MR.
said Mr.
Mcperson_0.
`` EH ? What 's that ? What have they been spoiling now ?"
enquired Mrs.
Mcperson_0.
`` One , two , three , four , five , six leetle fat rabbits !"
repeated Mr.
Mcperson_0 , counting on his fingers -- `` one , two , three --"
`` Do n't you be silly ; what do you mean , you silly old man ?"
`` In the sack ! one , two , three , four , five , six !"
replied Mr.
Mcperson_0.
-LRB- The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.
-RRB- MRS.
McGREGOR took hold of the sack and felt it.
`` Not fit to eat ; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak"
`` Line your old cloak ?"
shouted Mr.
Mcperson_0 -- `` I shall sell them and buy myself baccy !"
`` Rabbit tobacco ! I shall skin them and cut off their heads"
MRS.
McGREGOR untied the sack and put her hand inside.
When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry.
She said that Mr.
Mcperson_0 had `` done it a purpose"
AND Mr.
Mcperson_0 was very angry too.
It was rather hurt.
THEN Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.
SO Mr.
Mcperson_0 did not get his tobacco , and Mrs.
Mcperson_0 did not get her rabbit skins.
The End"
This passion never , we perceive , remains In want from paucity of scheming brains.
THE husband , as he entered , loudly cried , I 've sold our bucking-tub.
THE reader wo n't require to know the rest ; What passed perhaps may easily be guessed.
I beat him with my stick all I know how , but he wo n't dance properly.
I must now sell him to the butcher and make what money out of him I can.
There is nothing else to be done"
Now the monkey was in the next room and overheard ever word of the conversation.
I have often heard tell of his wisdom.
I will go and try"
There was no time to lose.
The boar was at home , and the monkey began his tale of woe at once.
`` Good Mr.
Boar , I have heard of your excellent wisdom.
I am in great trouble , you alone can help me.
What do you advise me to do ? I know how clever you are !"
The boar was pleased at the flattery and determined to help the monkey.
He thought for a little while and then said : `` Has n't your master a baby ?"
`` Oh , yes ,"
said the monkey , `` he has one infant son"
`` What then ?"
said the monkey.
The monkey thanked the boar many times and then went home.
His life depended on whether the boar 's plan succeeded or not.
He was the first up , waiting anxiously for what was to happen.
Then all happened as the boar had planned.
Suddenly there was a noise in the porch and a loud cry from the child.
`` There !"
said the wife.
`` You are right , wife , for once ,"
said the man as he carried the child into the house.
St.
It was an old state carriage.
`` Humph ! humph !"
`` The beautiful has departed ,"
it sighed -- or at least it might have done so.
We came back in autumn.
The coach was there still , but the pigs were gone.
They were playing the grand lords out in the woods.
A little green leaf grows up out of his head , and that 's his feather.
-LRB- Illustration : THE PIGS AT HOME IN THE OLD STATE COACH.
and the majority is always right.
They found the place so inexpressibly lovely ! `` Oui ! oui !"
they all exclaimed.
The old ones put their heads together.
`` Umph !"
`` Oui ! oui !"
chimed in all the rest.
she said.
`` Good ! good !"
`` Gone ! gone !"
sighed the rose king.
`` All the beautiful is gone !"
It was lit up like a star , and threw its long ray among the trees.
A song sounded forth out of the house ! Beautiful children played there round the old grandfather.
`` There is always somebody who has a soul for the beautiful !"
she said"
there was one evening quite a social gathering in the home of a father of a family.
The weather was still mild and warm.
But they were not talking about this.
It was , in fact , an old gravestone.
`` Yes ,"
-LRB- Illustration : PREBEN SCHWANE AND HIS WIFE MARTHA.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` One can very well see that it is a gravestone ,"
`` On my word , that must be the gravestone of Preben Schwane and his wife !"
They were an honest old couple.
I can remember them from the days of my boyhood.
Every one knew them , and every one esteemed them.
They were the oldest pair here in the town.
The old woman died first : that day is still quite clear before my mind.
The old man was very much moved , and wept like a child.
Time passes away , and all things change.
The high-road now goes over the resting-place of old Preben and his wife.
No one thinks of them any more"
And the old man who had told all this shook his head scornfully.
`` Forgotten ! Everything will be forgotten !"
he said.
`` Forgotten ! Everything will be forgotten !"
was repeated in the room.
The seed-corn of this hour shall ripen in the course of time to a blooming poem.
The beautiful and the good shall not be forgotten ; it shall live on in legend and in song"
EAST INDIA was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until he had received six hundred dollars.
Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say , `` Mr.
Burgomaster ,"
should be put to death on the gallows.
He said he would gladly do that , if he did but know how.
Then he was caught up , and was instantly in East India.
Then he went to his father and said , `` Fisherman , how hast thou got here ?"
He , however , would not stop , and was brought to the gallows.
And they had told him not to fear , and that he could deliver them.
That was just a chance , the people said ; as many things happen by chance.
She said she was happy , for now she had conquered.
And then he gave her her lost soul back again , and brought her here into the church.
`` Now I am in the house of God ,"
she said , `` and in that house we are happy"
Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister.
The brothers were married , but their wives did not do the cooking for the family.
It was done by their sister , who stopped at home to cook.
In this way she will be delayed.
Let the water not flow into her pitcher , and you may keep the maiden as your own"
Then after a while the water began slowly to rise.
The pitcher filled with water , and along with it she sank and was drowned.
The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself , and carried her off.
The instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it.
The Jogi , however , knew its value , and refused to sell it.
Of the latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated.
They denied having taken it , so he had to depart , leaving his fiddle behind him.
So saying , he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood.
He said , `` No.
.
But from to-day , you and I are one"
So they began lovingly to hold converse with each other.
The Bonga girl recognized them at once , but they did not know who she was.
She brought them water on their arrival , and afterwards set cooked rice before them.
And that was all the revenge she took"
He was astounded , and knew not what to say to it.
They run about so , and have nothing on , and must be cold.
The man said , `` I shall be very glad to do it ;"
Then they danced and skipped and leapt over chairs and benches.
At last they danced out of doors.
Then three elves came and conducted her to a hollow mountain , where the little folks lived.
Everything there was small , but more elegant and beautiful than can be described.
At last she set out on her way home.
In her trouble she went to her neighbor , and asked her advice.
The woman did everything that her neighbor bade her.
And he began to laugh at it.
`` I saw a little girl weeping ,"
said the Moon ; `` she was weeping over the depravity of the world.
She had received a most beautiful doll as a present.
Yes , these are the troubles of life of which the little girl had often heard tell.
I wonder if I have done anything wrong ? ' And she considered.
' And she looked up at the doll.
`` For heaven 's sake just go in peace ,"
answered the woman , `` I will manage that"
`` You , indeed ,"
said the man.
And having said that , the man went on his way.
I will take the beasts away with me at once"
`` True ,"
answered the man , `` but I have forgotten to buckle on my money-belt.
Have no fear , however , you shall have security for my paying.
I will take two cows with me and leave one , and then you will have a good pledge"
answered the woman , `` and as you said , for two hundred thalers.
They are scarcely worth so much , but the man took them without making any objection"
`` Where is the money ?"
asked the peasant.
`` Oh , I have not got the money ,"
`` What kind of security ?"
asked the man.
I have managed very cunningly , for I have kept the smallest , which eats the least"
`` What do you want , my friend ?"
said the woman to him ; `` I do n't know you , where do you come from ?"
`` I have fallen down from heaven ,"
`` No ,"
You must have seen him ?"
`` Oh , yes , I have seen him , but all men ca n't get on well.
He keeps sheep , and the sheep give him a great deal to do.
His clothes are all torn to pieces too , and will soon fall off his body.
`` Who would have thought it ?"
You will be so kind as to take it with you"
`` That wo n't do very well ,"
`` Then hark you ,"
If you hide the purse in your pocket , no one will know that you have it"
`` If you ca n't manage it any other way ,"
said the peasant , `` I will do you that favor"
`` Just sit still where you are ,"
Before she went away , she thanked him again a thousand times for his courtesy.
Who would ever have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything up in heaven ?"
The son was full of astonishment.
`` Mother ,"
He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed.
`` Have you seen the man who has fallen down from Heaven ?"
cried the youth to him.
`` Yes ,"
`` Alas ,"
`` Aha !"
thought the peasant , `` here is another who has no wick in his lamp !"
`` Why should I not do you this favor ?"
said he , and mounted the horse and rode off in a quick trot.
The youth remained sitting there till night fell , but the peasant never came back.
thought he , `` and the peasant has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father"
`` Thou hast done well ,"
answered she , `` thy legs are younger than his , and thou canst go on foot"
So thought the peasant , but you no doubt prefer the simple folks"
would cook good , sweet porridge , and when she said , `` Stop , little pot ,"
it ceased to cook.
`` Oh , yes ,"
Do not go in"
`` Why not ?"
asked the King 's son.
The maiden sighed and said , `` My step-mother practises wicked arts ; she is ill-disposed toward strangers"
`` Good evening ,"
growled she , and pretended to be quite friendly.
`` Take a seat and rest yourselves"
She blew up the fire on which she was cooking something in a small pot.
They slept quietly until early morning.
`` Take that to your master ,"
said she.
`` Who knows whether we shall find anything better to-day ?"
said the servant ; so he killed the raven , and took it with him.
By nightfall they found an inn and entered it.
The servant gave the raven to the innkeeper to make ready for supper.
She opened all doors to the stranger and showed him the heaped-up treasures.
Then he went to her and laid his riddle before her.
`` What is this ?"
said he , `` One slew none , and yet slew twelve"
Then she asked , `` One slew none , what is that ?"
She inquired further , `` And yet slew twelve , what is that ?"
He answered , `` That means twelve murderers , who ate the raven and died of it"
The judges said , `` Bring us a proof of this"
`` Well ,"
The frogs , however , stood to their , `` aik aik , aik , aik"
`` Come , then , if you wo n't believe it , I can count it out to you"
`` What ,"
and threw all the money into the water to them.
and besides that , did not throw the money out again.
He still waited a long while until evening came on and he was forced to go home.
after him till he went home quite angry.
The dog , however , answered nothing but `` wow , wow"
`` Wow , wow , wow ,"
said the dog.
and was quite delighted.
But no one would come and pay it.
`` There is no trusting any one now ,"
Then the butcher grew angry , snatched a broomstick and drove him out.
`` Wait a while ,"
said the peasant , `` there is still some justice in the world !"
and went to the royal palace and begged for an audience.
`` Alas !"
and he related at full length all that had happened.
Thou mayst thank God for thy good fortune !"
`` Oh ,"
Then the King grew angry , and said , `` Thou art a boor"
`` Ah , Lord King ,"
replied the peasant , `` what can you expect from an ox , but beef ?"
`` Stop ,"
answered the King , `` thou shalt have another reward.
`` Yes , that is what I think ,"
answered the peasant ; `` five hundred are to be counted out to me"
`` Hark thee ,"
said the soldier , `` give me some of it.
What canst thou do with all that money ?"
`` As it is thou ,"
`` Jew ,"
`` Pull his coat off ,"
said the latter , `` and he shall have his five hundred"
`` Ah !"
Go into my treasure chamber and get some money for thyself , as much as thou wilt"
Afterwards he went to an inn and counted out his money.
`` Good heavens !"
`` I know what 's right better than that ,"
answered the peasant , `` I shall have a new coat made first.
What will people not do for love !"
The King reproached the countryman because of the evil speaking of which the Jew had informed him.
`` Ah ,"
`` What is that ?"
shrieked the Jew.
and again he ordered something to be counted out to him in hard thalers.
It chanced that they all found skilful masters , who taught them their trades well.
The barber only shaved great people , and he too already looked upon the house as his own.
As they were sitting thus , all at once a hare came running across the field.
`` Ah , ha , just in time !"
said the barber.
`` Well done !"
said the old man.
`` Your brothers will have to exert themselves wonderfully , or the house will be yours"
Soon after , up came a nobleman in his coach , dashing along at full speed.
`` Now you shall see what I can do , father ,"
`` You are a fine fellow , and as clever as your brother ,"
said his father ; `` I do not know to which I ought to give the house"
Then the third son said , `` Father , let me have my turn , if you please ;"
`` Yesterday ,"
began the Moon , `` I looked down upon the turmoil of Paris.
My eye penetrated into an apartment of the Louvre.
I think she was actually weeping"
Died ! ' mournfully repeated the old woman.
I do not think another word was spoken , and they soon quitted the hall.
The people stormed the Tuileries.
Even women and children were to be found among the combatants.
They penetrated into the apartments and halls of the palace.
A poor half-grown boy in a ragged blouse fought among the older insurgents.
Mortally wounded with several bayonet thrusts , he sank down.
This happened in the throne-room.
It was more than a fortnight since the Moon had shone.
Now he stood once more , round and bright , above the clouds , moving slowly onward.
Hear what the Moon told me.
`` From a town in Fezzan I followed a caravan.
`` For many nights I followed the train.
At home the beautiful wife prayed for her husband and her father.
Now the desert lies behind them.
The luxuriant herbage is trampled down , crushed by the feet of elephants.
A negro leads a young lion which he has bought , by a string.
He raises his head , and --"
But at this moment a cloud passed before the Moon , and then another.
I heard nothing more from him this evening"
`` It is indeed a heavy burden ,"
How can one have any rest , or peace of one 's life ?"
`` I know what I will do ,"
The parents did not reflect long.
`` Birds of a feather , flock together ,"
they thought , and consented.
So fat Trina became Harry 's wife , and led out both the goats.
But fat Trina was no less idle.
`` Dear Harry ,"
`` Thou hast spoken like a sensible woman ,"
replied Harry.
The neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats.
Lazy Harry did not like to leave his bed before noon.
`` He who rises early ,"
said he , `` wastes his substance"
`` But ,"
`` Dost thou think ,"
`` Oh ,"
Look , Harry ,"
She reached her arm out to strike , but unhappily hit the honey-pitcher above the bed.
`` There lie the goose and the young gosling ,"
said Harry , `` and want no looking after.
But it is lucky that the pitcher did not fall on my head.
We have all reason to be satisfied with our lot"
What matters if we do get up a little later the day is always long enough"
`` Yes ,"
answered Trina , `` we shall always get to the end of it at the proper time.
'"
`` I am already aged ,"
Only seek out a country where such things are still unknown , and your fortune is made"
`` Look !"
answered he.
`` A ridiculously small price for such a precious creature !"
they cried unanimously , and willingly gave him what he had asked.
At last , however , he chanced upon an island where the people knew nothing of scythes.
And now the third brother wanted to take his cat to the right man.
Mew !"
But the cat , whose thirst had become still greater , merely answered , `` Mew ! Mew !"
The youth understood her to say , `` Most certainly not ! most certainly not !"
and took this answer to the King.
`` Then ,"
said the councillors , `` she shall yield to force"
Cannon were brought out , and the palace was soon in flames.
It was , however , all to no purpose , they had nothing and came to nothing.
This pleased the husband right well.
`` It is true ,"
I shall be glad ,"
`` The milk is not for thee ,"
`` Certainly ,"
replied the man , `` but still we will take a little milk ; that will do no harm"
`` Who has taught thee to manage cows ?"
`` Wife ,"
said the man , `` be quiet , or I will give thee a blow on thy mouth !"
`` What !"
cried she , `` thou threatenest me , thou glutton , thou rascal , thou lazy Harry !"
And wish for death , since all round went wrong.
At the creation of the world , the light at night had been sufficient.
`` That is the moon ,"
answered he ; `` our mayor bought it for three thalers , and fastened it to the oak-tree.
He receives a thaler a week from us for doing it"
What a pleasure it would be not to have to feel about at night in the darkness !"
`` I 'll tell you what we 'll do ,"
said the second ; `` we will fetch a cart and horses and carry away the moon.
The people here may buy themselves another"
`` I 'm a good climber ,"
said the third , `` I will bring it down"
They conveyed it safely into their own country , and placed it on a high oak.
The light of the moon decreased , but still not visibly.
When the second died , the second quarter was buried with him , and the light diminished.
They rose up and were merry , and fell into their former ways of living.
The noise became greater and greater , and at last reached even to heaven.
The bride answered , `` First run and bring me my little wreath which is hanging to a willow"
`` I am going to bury my little hen"
`` May I drive with thee ?"
Then the procession went onwards , and they reached the stream.
`` How are we to get over ?"
said the little cock.
she spoke to him in a friendly way.
`` Good-day , dear Mr.
`` I understand but one ,"
replied the cat , modestly.
`` What art is that ?"
asked the fox.
`` When the hounds are following me , I can spring into a tree and save myself"
`` Is that all ?"
said the fox.
Just then came a hunter with four dogs.
`` Open your sack , Mr.
Fox , open your sack ,"
`` Ah , Mr.
Fox ,"
cried the cat.
The mother of Hans said , `` Whither away , Hans ?"
Hans answered , `` To Grethel"
`` Behave well , Hans"
`` Oh , I 'll behave well.
Good-bye , mother"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans comes to Grethel , `` Good day , Grethel"
`` Good day , Hans.
What dost thou bring that is good ?"
`` I bring nothing , I want to have something given me"
Grethel presents Hans with a needle.
Hans says , `` Good-bye , Grethel"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans takes the needle , sticks it into a hay-cart , and follows the cart home.
`` Good evening , mother"
`` Good evening , Hans.
Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` Took nothing ; had something given me"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` Gave me a needle"
`` Where is the needle , Hans ?"
`` Stuck it in the hay-cart"
`` That was ill done , Hans.
Thou shouldst have stuck the needle in thy sleeve"
`` Never mind , I 'll do better next time"
`` Whither away , Hans ?"
`` To Grethel , mother"
`` Behave well , Hans"
`` Oh , I 'll behave well.
Good-bye , mother"

`` Good-bye Hans"
Hans takes the knife , sticks it in his sleeve , and goes home.

Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` Took her nothing , she gave me something"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` Gave me a knife"

`` Stuck in my sleeve"

`` Oh , I 'll behave well.
Good-bye , mother"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans comes to Grethel.
`` Good day , Grethel"
`` Good day , Hans.
What good thing dost thou bring ?"
`` I bring nothing , I want something given me"
Grethel presents Hans with a young goat.
`` Good-bye , Grethel"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans takes the goat , ties its legs , and puts it in his pocket.
When he gets home it is suffocated.
`` Good evening , mother"
`` Good evening , Hans.
Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` Took nothing , she gave me something"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` She gave me a goat"
`` Where is the goat , Hans ?"
`` Put it in my pocket"
`` That was ill done , Hans , thou shouldst have put a rope round the goat 's neck"
`` Never mind , will do better next time"
`` Whither away , Hans ?"
`` To Grethel , mother"
`` Behave well , Hans"
`` Oh , I 'll behave well.
Good-bye , mother"
`` Good-bye , Hans"

`` Good day , Hans.
What good thing dost thou bring ?"
`` I bring nothing , I want something given me"
Grethel presents Hans with a piece of bacon.
`` Good-bye , Grethel"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans takes the bacon , ties it to a rope , and drags it away behind him.
The dogs come and devour the bacon.
`` Good evening , mother"
`` Good evening , Hans"
`` Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` I took her nothing , she gave me something"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` Gave me a bit of bacon"
`` Where is the bacon , Hans ?"
`` I tied it to a rope , brought it home , dogs took it"
`` That was ill done , Hans , thou shouldst have carried the bacon on thy head"
`` Never mind , will do better next time"
`` Whither away , Hans ?"
`` To Grethel , mother"

`` I 'll behave well.
Good-bye , mother"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans comes to Grethel.
`` Good day , Grethel"
`` Good day , Hans"
`` What good thing dost thou bring ?"
`` I bring nothing , but would have something given"
Grethel presents Hans with a calf.
`` Good-bye , Grethel"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans takes the calf , puts it on his head , and the calf kicks his face.
`` Good evening , mother"
`` Good evening , Hans.
Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` I took nothing , but had something given me"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` A calf"
`` Where hast thou the calf , Hans ?"
`` I set it on my head and it kicked my face"
`` Never mind , will do better next time"
`` Whither away , Hans ?"

`` Behave well , Hans"

Good-bye , mother"
`` Good-bye , Hans"
Hans comes to Grethel.

Then Hans goes to his mother.
`` Good evening , mother"
`` Good evening , Hans.
Where hast thou been ?"
`` With Grethel"
`` What didst thou take her ?"
`` I took her nothing"
`` What did Grethel give thee ?"
`` She gave me nothing , she came with me"
`` Where hast thou left Grethel ?"
`` That was ill done , Hans , thou shouldst have cast friendly eyes on her"
`` Never mind , will do better"
Then Grethel became angry , tore herself loose and ran away , and became the bride of Hans"
`` I was gliding over the Lueneburg Heath ,"
the Moon said.
He died in the coldness of the night : it was his farewell song that I heard.
`` The morning dawn came glimmering red.
Thou must sell thyself , thy wife , and thy children.
But your griefs shall not last long.
Fare away , fare away , over the heaving billows.
The women carried hymn books , and walked into the church.
Oh , pray , pray for those who are wandering to find graves beyond the foaming billows"
`` I will now give you a picture from Frankfort ,"
said the Moon.
`` I especially noticed one building there.
No , it was a private house , plain in appearance , and painted green.
It stood near the old Jews ' Street.
It was Rothschild 's house.
`` I looked through the open door.
She was his mother.
Here her children had been born , from hence the fortune of the family had arisen.
If she deserted the despised street and the little house , fortune would also desert her children.
That was her firm belief"
The Moon told me no more ; his visit this evening was far too short.
But I thought of the old woman in the narrow despised street.
So said Ole the tower-keeper.
So he betook himself up thither , and smoked his pipe as he made his solitary rounds.
`` I will give you another picture of Sweden ,"
said the Moon.
How quietly they sleep ! I can remember them quite plainly.
And Fatty wanted them all.
To his delight , there were goodies almost without end.
He nosed about , picking up potato peelings , and bits of bacon.
And perhaps the best of all was a piece of cornbread , which Fatty fairly gobbled.
But Fatty liked them ; and he ate them all , down to the smallest bit.
He was thirsty , then.
So he went down to the brook , which ran close by the camp.
The loggers had cut a hole through the ice , so they could get water.
And Fatty crept close to the edge of the hole and drank.
He drank a great deal of water , because he was very thirsty.
And when he had finished he sat down on the ice for a time.
He did not care to stir about just then.
And he did not think he would ever want anything to eat again.
At last Fatty Coon rose to his feet.
He felt very queer.
There was a strange , tight feeling about his stomach.
And his sides were no longer thin.
They stuck out just as they had before winter came -- only more so.
He wondered what he had been eating.
Those dry things that tasted like apples -- he wondered what they were.
`` I know you already ,"
I must go and see for myself what kind of a monster it is ,"
added the master , and went quite boldly into the granary and looked round him.
Yet two others ventured in , but they fared no better.
All praised his courage , though many feared for his life.
George , who slew the dragon.
in a harsh voice.
`` Strike home ! strike home !"
screamed the crowd outside to the valiant hero.
`` Any one who was standing where I am standing ,"
answered he , `` would not cry , strike home !"
And now there was no one left who dared to put himself in such danger.
`` The monster ,"
They took counsel as to what they ought to do to prevent the whole town being destroyed.
`` My opinion ,"
Thus no one will have to endanger his life.
This is no time for thinking of expense , and niggardliness would be ill applied"
All agreed with him.
Let any one who will not believe it , go thither and inquire for himself"
AND then person_0 asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.
person_0 ran on , and on.
THE path ended under a big rock.
LUCIE , knocked -- once -- twice , and interrupted the song.
A little frightened voice called out `` Who 's that ?"
said person_0.
`` Have you seen my pocket-handkins ?"
Tiggy-winkle ; oh , yes if you please 'm , I 'm an excellent clear - starcher !"
And she took something out of a clothes - basket , and spread it on the ironing-blanket.
`` WHAT 'S that thing ?"
said person_0 -- `` that 's not my pocket-handkin ?"
And she ironed it and folded it , and put it on one side.
THEN she took something else off a clothes-horse -- `` That is n't my pinny ?"
said person_0.
said Mrs.
Tiggy - winkle"
But she hid her grief with a strong face , as they say in Japan.
`` Kimbo ,"
said his mother , `` mind and be a good boy"
`` Mr.
Kintaro ,"
said the faithful animals , `` we wish you good health on your travels"
Lord Raiko 's army was famous for its band called `` The Four Braves"
He was by far the strongest of them all.
Lord Raiko ordered Kintaro to the rescue.
He immediately started off , delighted at the prospect of trying his sword.
Is not this the story of a great hero ?"
This and that He vaunted with assertion pat.
From gasconade to gasconade Passed to the conquests he had made In love.
This one he loved for she was fair , That for her glossy ebon hair.
One miss , to tame his cruel rigor , Had brought him gifts.
With this I shall buy a couple of goats.
Then , with the goats , I shall buy cows.
As soon as they have calved , I shall sell the calves.
Then , with the calves , I shall buy buffaloes ; with the buffaloes , mares.
With that gold I shall get a house with four wings.
She will have a son , and I shall call him Somasarman.
Then I get up , and give her such a kick with my foot"
While he thought this , he gave a kick with his foot , and broke the pot.
All the rice fell over him , and made him quite white.
So the elder went in on the west side , and the younger on the east.
When the younger had gone a short way , a little man stepped up to him.
He thanked the little man , shouldered the spear , and went on fearlessly.
Then he took the monster on his back and went homewards with it to the King.
and every one believed it.
`` What a wonderful horn !"
said the shepherd ; `` it sings by itself ; I must take it to my lord the King"
And when he came with it to the King the horn again began to sing its little song.
But the bones of the murdered man were laid to rest in a beautiful tomb in the churchyard"
`` Yes ,"
replied the hen , `` come , we will have some pleasure together"
`` I like that !"
I do not mind being coachman and sitting on the box , but drag it myself I will not"
and ran with open beak at the cock.
They cried , `` Stop ! stop !"
And now they had themselves well served , and feasted and rioted.
`` This morning everything attacks my head ,"
for the needle had pricked him still worse than the pin , and not in the head.
I confess The ruse has oft been tried before , But it succeeded as of yore.
-- `` What 's that I hear ? Refection bell !"
` Tis time to part.
Adieu ! -- Farewell ! -- `` How 's this ?"
exclaimed the abbess , `` why `` The last at table ?"
-- `` Madam , I `` Have had my dress-maker"
The Lord , who foresaw their suffering , had pity on them , and granted the request.
So the ears were left as they now grow"
Then he wanted to travel homewards , and be in his own house before nightfall.
So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse , and rode away.
`` Let it be wanting ,"
I am in a hurry"
Shall I take him to the blacksmith ?"
`` Let it still be wanting ,"
I am in haste"
He rode forth , but before long the horse began to limp.
And there he did not arrive until quite late at night.
`` And that unlucky nail ,"
said he to himself , `` has caused all this disaster"
Hasten slowly"
and carried them off with her.
The boy said , `` What are the three questions ?"
The King said , `` The next question is , how many stars are there in the sky ?"
The shepherd boy said , `` Give me a great sheet of white paper ,"
But no one was able to do it.
The King said , `` The third question is , how many seconds of time are there in eternity"
There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty , but idle and negligent.
A young man had wooed the lazy girl , and the wedding was to take place.
The storks tell their little ones very many stories , all of the moor and the marsh.
These stories are generally adapted to the age and capacity of the hearers.
The youngest are content if they are told `` Kribble-krabble , plurre-murre"
That history is very well known.
The second is not known yet , perhaps , because it is quite an inland story.
It is certainly rightly called the `` wild moor ;"
Yes , in detail , exactly the same things were seen then that may yet be beheld.
He sank and went down to the `` marsh king ,"
as they called him , who ruled below in the great moorland empire.
They also called him `` gungel king ;"
but we like the name `` marsh king"
better , and by that we 'll call him , as the storks did.
`` I 've something very terrible to tell you ,"
he said to the stork-mamma.
`` Let that be ,"
she replied.
`` You must know it ,"
he continued.
She has come here , and she is gone !"
`` You are much too long-winded !"
exclaimed the stork-mamma , `` and the eggs might catch cold.
I ca n't bear being kept in such suspense !"
`` I have kept watch ,"
`` Yes , certainly ,"
she replied ; `` but tell me about the princess.
I 'm sick of hearing of the swan 's feathers"
`` Well , you know that in the middle of the moor there is something like a lake ,"
continued stork-papa.
`` You can see one corner of it if you raise yourself a little.
The others nodded , and picked up the empty feather dress and took care of it.
-LRB- person_1 : THE PRINCESS LEFT IN THE MARSH.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Why , that is terrible !"
said stork-mamma.
`` I ca n't bear to hear any more of it.
But now tell me what happened next"
`` The princess wept and lamented aloud.
Then the poor child was terribly frightened , and sprang up to flee away.
Your heart would have burst , mother , if you had seen it"
`` You ought not to tell me anything of the kind at such a time as this ,"
said stork-mamma ; `` the eggs might suffer by it.
The princess will find some way of escape ; some one will come to help her.
`` But I shall go and look every day to see if anything happens ,"
said stork-papa.
And he was as good as his word.
`` But she can not possibly be left lying there ,"
thought stork-papa ; `` and in my nest there are so many persons already.
But stay , I have a thought.
I shall fly with the child to the person_0 's wife.
What rejoicing there will be yonder !"
`` So you see ,"
`` Ah , I said it would be so , from the very beginning !"
said the stork-mamma ; `` but now think a little of your own family.
Our traveling time is drawing on ; sometimes I feel quite restless in my wings already.
Our young ones will behave well at the exercising , or I am much deceived in them"
she said.
`` Have I had a bad dream ? Is it not my own lovely cherub lying there ?"
And she kissed and hugged it ; but the child struggled and fought like a little wild cat.
A good wind for one is a contrary wind for another.
Here were two natures changing inwardly as well as outwardly with the sunlight.
`` All males here , and ready ,"
they cried ; `` and the wives and children too"
`` How light we feel !"
Ah , how charming it is , traveling to foreign lands !"
`` Mind you keep close to us during your flight ,"
said papa and mamma.
`` Do n't use your beaks too much , for that tires the chest"
And the storks flew away.
-LRB- person_1 : THE VIKING 'S FEAST.
Guests were invited , and received handsome gifts : all feuds and all malice were forgotten.
The person_0 's wife sat upon the high seat in the open hall.
They also knew that `` even the welcome guest becomes wearisome when he sitteth long in the house ;"
`` Birds feather-less ,"
as they called the snow , flew in thick masses , and winter was coming on fast.
The young storks thought it was optical illusion , they found everything so glorious.
`` Yes , it 's delightful here ; and it 's always like this in our warm country ,"
said the stork-mamma ; and the young ones felt quite frisky on the strength of it.
`` Is there anything more to be seen ?"
they asked.
`` Are we to go much farther into the country ?"
`` There 's nothing further to be seen ,"
answered stork-mamma.
It is best to stay here , where there are frogs and locusts.
I shall stay here , and you shall stay too"
And there they remained.
`` She is dead !"
But we had our revenge.
Never will she return to the land of Egypt"
And then the two wept.
-LRB- person_1 : THE KING OF EGYPT DECEIVED BY THE PRINCESSES.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Treachery and lies !"
he cried.
`` I should like to run my beak deep into their chests"
`` And perhaps break it off ,"
interposed the stork-mamma ; `` and then you would look well.
Think first of yourself , and then of your family , and all the rest does not concern you"
`` That is a beautiful thought !"
stork-papa said immediately.
`` I do n't quite understand it ,"
stork-mamma replied : `` and that 's not my fault , but the fault of the thought.
But let it be as it will , I 've something else to think of"
But one thing stork-papa understood.
and on this occasion they had surpassed themselves , and said more than they understood.
They repeated it , and wrote down as a recipe , `` Love begets life"
`` I should like to take away the swan 's feathers from the two faithless princesses ,"
I 'll hide the two swan-feather suits up there , till somebody has occasion for them"
`` But where do you intend to hide them ?"
asked stork-mamma.
`` Up in our nest in the moor ,"
answered he.
In those northern countries no one can have too many wraps"
`` No one will thank you for it ,"
quoth stork-mamma ; `` but you 're the master.
Except at breeding-time , I have nothing to say"
`` Self-achieved is well-achieved ,"
she said.
-LRB- person_1 : THE TRANSFORMED PRINCESS.
Her eyes then assumed a very melancholy expression.
said stork-papa , `` now she 's grown up the image of her Egyptian mother.
`` And our good nest would be destroyed too ,"
You 'd best go down into the mud and stay there with her.
Helga does n't know in the least what she does.
You should have just left her lying in the water-lily , and she would have been dead long ago"
`` You are much better than your words ,"
said stork-papa.
`` I know you better than you know yourself"
said stork-mamma to herself ; `` but I wo n't tell him so"
Early in that autumn the person_0 came home , laden with booty , and bringing prisoners with him.
It seemed as if she only understood the meaning of the word `` love ,"
For the first time a man was to be sacrificed here.
as she said.
`` Thy hard time will come ,"
said the person_0 's wife ; `` and it will be terrible to me too.
The wrinkled frog crouched in the corner alone.
It seemed as though a painful new life were arising in her inmost heart.
It seemed as if a strong hidden will gave her strength.
-LRB- person_1 : THE FLIGHT.
Then she trembled.
Helga was again the beautiful maiden with the wicked , demoniac spirit.
The child 's short garment reached only to her knee.
`` Let me get at thee !"
She pressed in upon him.
-LRB- person_1 : THE CHRISTIAN PRIEST 'S SPELL.
`` Thou must sit behind me , not before me ,"
he said.
And he knelt down and prayed fervently.
It seemed as though the woodland scenes were consecrated as a holy church by his prayer.
The wood became thicker as they went on , and at last became a trackless wilderness.
The wild sloe grew across the way , so that they had to ride round the bushes.
-LRB- person_1 : HELGA AND THE PRIEST ATTACKED BY ROBBERS.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Where hast thou stolen that beauteous maiden ?"
Then the robbers were seized with terror , and let her go.
The full moon was already rising.
She stood still beside the corpse of the priest and the carcase of the slain horse.
At last she saw that her endeavors would not succeed.
And now she thought the grave-hill would be strong and secure.
-LRB- person_1 : HELGA IN THE TREE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa Then in this transformation it seemed as if two natures were striving within her.
But they could not understand her -- nor , indeed , could she understand herself.
Helga lifted up the cross , in pursuance of a sudden thought that came upon her.
She planted it upon the burial mound , over the priest and the dead horse.
Then the frog-skin fell from her , and she was once more the beauteous maiden.
Her sleep , however , was short.
Towards midnight she awoke.
the person_0 woman would have said ; and yet he seemed to stand in a flame of fire.
-LRB- person_1 : HELGA IS TAKEN BACK TO THE MARSH.
`` Thou daughter of the moorland ,"
I come from the land of the dead.
The open wound in the forehead of the slain Christian shone like a diadem.
He took the cross from the grave and held it aloft.
The dragon that guards buried treasures likewise lifted up his head and gazed after the riders.
Every germ came forth from the deep ground.
All that had life lifted itself up.
Helga thought it was her own likeness she saw upon the mirror of the calm waters.
-LRB- person_1 : HELGA MEETS WITH HER MOTHER IN THE MARSH.
`` Am I really looking at my own image from beneath the deep waters ?"
asked the mother.
`` Is it myself that I see reflected on the clear mirror ?"
exclaimed the daughter.
And they approached one another , and embraced.
The heart of the mother beat quickest , and she understood the quickening pulses.
`` My child ! thou flower of my own heart ! my lotos-flower of the deep waters !"
`` In the swan 's plumage came I hither ,"
said the mother ; `` and here also I threw off my dress of feathers.
He seized me in his arms , and I felt as if I must die.
Since that hour I have dreamed no more.
`` And now we will speak with one another ,"
It happens more than fortunately that you came to-night.
`` And the lotos-flower which I was to bring with me ,"
Homeward ! homeward !"
`` Yes , we must go to the person_0 's castle ,"
said stork-papa ; `` mother and the youngsters are waiting for us there.
I 'll begin clapping at once , that they may know we 're coming"
And stork-papa clapped in first-rate style , and they all flew away towards the person_0 's castle.
In the castle every one was sunk in deep sleep.
The person_0 's wife had not retired to rest until it was late.
The winged Valkyrs rode before them , and the dead warriors closed the train.
The whole firmament was ablaze with northern lights , and yet the darkness seemed to predominate.
It was a terrible hour.
`` White Christian !"
The person_0 woman woke ; and she heard the same noise without still continuing.
And she remembered her dream , which still filled her soul as if it were reality.
-LRB- person_1 : THE DISGUISED PRINCESSES BID FAREWELL TO THE VIKING WOMAN.
`` We will not wait for the swans ,"
said stork-mamma : `` if they want to go with us they had better come.
We ca n't sit here till the plovers start.
What are yonder swans flapping their wings for ?"
`` Well , everyone flies in his own fashion ,"
`` Do n't talk about snakes while we are flying up here ,"
said stork-mamma.
`` It only puts ideas into the children 's heads which ca n't be gratified"
`` Are those the high mountains of which I heard tell ?"
asked Helga , in the swan 's plumage.
`` They are storm clouds driving on beneath us ,"
replied her mother.
`` What are yonder white clouds that rise so high ?"
asked Helga again.
`` Those are the mountains covered with perpetual snow which you see yonder ,"
replied her mother.
And they flew across the lofty Alps towards the blue Mediterranean.
`` Africa 's land ! Egypt 's strand !"
And all the birds caught sight of it , and hastened their flight.
`` I can scent the Nile mud and wet frogs ,"
said stork-mamma ; `` I begin to feel quite hungry.
They all belong to our family , though they are not nearly so beautiful as we.
They give themselves great airs , especially the ibis.
That 's my opinion , and I am always right"
`` Now the storks are come ,"
Friends and servants stood around his couch.
-LRB- person_1 : THE KING OF EGYPT 'S RECOVERY.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa And into the hall flew two beauteous swans.
They had come with the storks.
`` Now , at last , you will become something ,"
whispered stork-mamma , `` there 's no doubt about that"
`` What should I become ?"
asked stork-papa.
`` What have I done ? Nothing at all !"
You already look like an Egyptian doctor ; at least in my eyes"
`` I can not quite repeat the words as they were spoken ,"
`` And what did you receive ?"
asked stork-mamma.
There she saw two great ostriches running round rapidly in a narrow circle.
And the ostrich answered , `` I will"
And seriousness struck its roots deep into her mind and heart.
_ God willing _"
`` That 's heavy to carry ,"
The stork brings good fortune ; they 'll be obliged to acknowledge that over yonder"
`` You lay gold and I lay eggs ,"
said the stork-mamma.
`` Still one has one 's inward consciousness , mother ,"
replied stork-papa.
`` But you ca n't hang that round your neck ,"
stork-mamma retorted ; `` and it wo n't give you a good wind or a good meal"
The little nightingale , singing yonder in the tamarind tree , will soon be going north too.
And the nightingale flew away -- and time flew away.

Then strong wings were heard beating the air.
said stork-papa.
`` But it 's very little ,"
observed stork-mamma.
`` They could not possibly have done less"
`` The glory and brightness yonder outshines everything that is known on earth !"
he said.
Then he bore her up amid splendor and glory.
`` Now we must go back ; thou wilt be missed ,"
he said.
`` Only one more look !"
she begged.
`` But one short minute more !"
`` We must go back to the earth.
The guests will all depart"
`` Only one more look -- the last"
Alone she went through the empty great hall into the next chamber.
Strange warriors slept yonder.
`` You speak our language ,"
`` That 's a mistake ,"
said the stork ; `` you must have dreamt all that !"
`` No , no !"
she persisted.
And thus it was.
Helga saw it , and understood it , and sank on her knees.
`` Well , that 's a new ending to the story ,"
said stork-papa.
`` I had certainly not expected it.
But I like it very well"
`` But what will the young ones say to it ?"
said stork-mamma.
`` Yes , certainly , that 's the important point ,"
replied he"
The whole is like a glorious dream.
`` We are as happy as it is possible to be ,"
And the days went by like a glad festival.
`` Life is a gracious gift of Providence , an almost inappreciable gift !"
I can not compass the thought"
`` And perhaps the thought arises from the arrogance of men ,"
said the husband.
Were these not the words of the serpent , the origin of falsehood ?"
`` Surely you do not doubt the future life ?"
`` Faith promises it , and the priests tells us so !"
`` Yes , it has been given to _ us _ ,"
`` Yonder beggar ,"
`` HE has said , ` In my Father 's house are many mansions , '"
replied the young wife : `` heaven is immeasurable , as the love of our Maker is immeasurable.
`` This world is sufficient for me !"

aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` Such a moment ,"
he said , `` makes it worth while to be born , to fall , and to disappear !"
and he smiled.
Everything seemed to work together for them.
They advanced in honor , in prosperity , and in joy.
The young man was sent by his sovereign as ambassador to the court of Russia.

This all happened a long , long while ago.

The wind and the sea fog soon destroy the wood.
She stood still in front of it , and let her glance rest on the discolored memorial.
A few moments afterwards her husband stepped up to her.
`` That was a good sermon to-day ,"
the man said at length.
`` If we had not God to look to , we should have nothing !"
`` Yes ,"
To-morrow our little boy would have been five years old , if we had been allowed to keep him"
`` You will gain nothing by fretting , wife ,"
said the man.
`` The boy is well provided for.
He is there whither we pray to go"
And they said nothing more , but went forward to their house among the sand-hills.
Man and wife stepped into the house.
The evening came on.
It was dark , but towards midnight the moon would rise.
In a moment the fish people had sprung from their couch , and hastily arrayed themselves.
It required a practiced eye to descry the vessel out in the offing.
The vessel was a noble brig.
It drove towards the land , struck against the second reef , and remained fixed.
-LRB- person_1 : SAVED FROM THE WRECK.
The stern was lifted high above the flood.
How beautiful and fair she was ! certainly she must be a great lady.
`` Alas , it was a grief to see How the gallant ship sank speedily"
The wind still drove howling over the coast.
She opened her wonderfully beautiful eyes , and spoke a few words , but none understood her.
The ship had been stranded some distance south of Nissum Bay.
No one knew who the dead stranger was , or could even form a conjecture.
The pieces of wreck said nothing on the subject.
At last the verdict was given , `` Foundered at sea -- all lost"
And they called the boy person_2.
`` It must certainly be a Jewish child ,"
the people said , `` it looks so swarthy"
`` It might be an Italian or a Spaniard ,"
observed the clergyman.
The boy throve.
The noble blood in his veins was warm , and he became strong on his homely fare.
The pomegranate seed from Spanish soil became a hardy plant on the coast of West Jutland.
Childhood has sunny heights for all , whose memory gleams through the whole after life.
The boy had many opportunities for pleasure and play.
One day another ship was stranded there.
Among other things , a chest of rare flower bulbs floated ashore.
The visits to the church were festal visits.
But among the festal visits in the fisherman 's house , one was particularly distinguished.
He used to come in a cart painted red , and filled with eels.
It was drawn by two dun oxen , and person_2 was allowed to guide them.
' ` They 'll come again , ' said the mother-eel.
' ` Oh , they 'll come again , ' the mother-eel persisted.
` No , ' replied the daughters , ` for he ate them up.
' ` They 'll come again , ' repeated the mother-eel.
` But he drank brandy after them , ' continued the daughters.
' `` And therefore ,"
said the eel breeder , in conclusion , `` it is always right to take brandy after eating eels"
-LRB- person_1 : THE EEL BREEDER 'S VISIT.
He was to go to a festival -- though it was certainly a burial feast.
A wealthy relative of the fisherman 's family had died.
Past this castle went person_2 and his foster-parents.
So they pursued their journey in the waggon across the rugged heath.
`` That is Lokeman driving his sheep ,"
said some one ; and this was enough to excite the fancy of person_2.
How quiet it was ! Far and wide the heath extended around them like a beautiful carpet.
The journey over the heath and the deep sand was only too quickly accomplished.
They stopped before the house of mourning , where they found plenty of guests within and without.
person_2 went to and fro in the house.
Here was a Hun 's Grave , and yonder another.
`` Ours are the best ,"
said the old fisherman , person_2 's foster-father ; `` these have no strength"
So the grave was opened , and he really was found with his thumb in his mouth.
`` I shall come again !"
said a voice within him.
He saw the Spanish coast , the native land of his parents.
There were several purchases to be made , and he was to carry them on board.
person_2 hardly knew where he was or which way he went.
Even the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into the temple.
Coloured pictures gleamed from their golden ground.
From the church they went to the market-place.
Here a quantity of provisions were given him to carry.
Here he rested his burden against the wall.
But no one there knew that , and he just as little as any one.
A hard winter followed that summer.
Snowstorms swept over land and sea , and there was a difficulty in getting about.
He determined to go there once more.
Spring came on , and the fishery began.
Hardly were the words spoken , when person_2 's hand sank down.
But I feel as if I had a pot in me that boiled over"
`` There let the thing rest ,"
In Norway the peasants go into the mountains , and lead out the cattle there to pasture.
And it seemed to person_2 as if the loose sand were giving way under his feet.
He spoke not a word , but only nodded his head , which signified `` yes"
`` Then it would be all over with me , and Martin too !"
This thought struck person_2 while they were out at sea , where his foster-father had been taken alarmingly ill.
.
The fever had seized him.
`` Father -- let me come !"
But he could not weave the fibers together , nor did he endeavor to do so.
`` You will not take sea service again , person_2 ?"
observed one of the old fishermen.
`` You will always stay with us , now"
-LRB- person_1 : ELSE AFFIRMS HER PREFERENCE FOR MARTIN.
And person_2 thought of many things.
The sea has heavy waves , but there are heavier waves in the human heart.
`` But Martin has no house , and can not get one"
`` But let us suppose he had one"
And person_2 thought of these things all night through.
And Else kissed him on the mouth when she heard that , for she loved Martin best.
In the early morning person_2 purposed to start.
He heard loud talking within.
A few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves.
In the sand the sea-eringa was blooming here and there.
as the young eels had said.
But this concerned him nothing.
The ferry was on the opposite side of the bay.
`` Thy wicked deed will cost thee thy life ,"
they said.
`` It is well that we caught thee"
He was accused of nothing less than murder.
Martin had been found dead , with a knife thrust through his neck.
Here Long Martha had been imprisoned , and hence she had been led away to the scaffold.
In the midst of the cellar roof was a little narrow air-hole , but no window.
Only a rough bench stood in the prison ; but `` a good conscience is a soft pillow ,"
and consequently person_2 could sleep well.
He was not left there long.
They carried him off to the town of Ringkjoebing , where his imprisonment was just as hard.
Those times were not like ours.
Hard measure was dealt out to the `` common"
The spring storms began to blow.
person_2 , in his prison , heard these sounds , and it was a relief to him.
said Broenne the merchant.
And in two days we 'll start for dear , friendly , peaceful person_3.

-LRB- person_1 : JUeRGEN 'S BETTER FORTUNE.
aaaaa -RRB- aaa At length they reached `` Wendelskajn ,"
as person_3 is called in the old Norwegian and Icelandic writings.
There was a great pressing of hands , and talking , and questioning.
person_2 found a happy home in Old person_3.
On the Sunday before her departure they all went to church , to the holy Communion.
It was the largest church north of the Limfjord.
After the sermon followed the holy Communion.
Two days later she left person_3 and went to Norway.
He stayed behind , and made himself useful in the house and in the business.
He went out fishing , and at that time fish were more plentiful and larger than now.
And so the autumn and the winter time passed away.
In April a ship was to start for Norway , and person_2 was to sail in it.
`` And it 's a pleasure to see you too , old wife ,"
said the old merchant.
`` person_2 has brought life into our winter evenings , and into you too , mother.
You look younger this year , and you seem well and bonny.
The sand-banks extend under the water a whole mile from the shore.
For a plank in the ship gave way , and the water rushed in.
The crew flew to the pumps , and attempted to stop the leak.
A signal of distress was hoisted ; but they were still a full mile from the shore.
Fishing boats were in sight , but they were still far distant.
person_2 threw his right arm about Clara , and pressed her close to him.
The fishermen grasped them , and lifted them into the boat.
And Clara lay pale and lifeless in the boat , that now made for the shore.
person_2 was still breathing.
The fishermen carried him into the nearest house upon the sand-hills.
The brain of the sick man was affected.
person_2 remained in the house of the merchant Broenne.
`` He contracted his illness in his endeavor to save our child ,"
said the old man , `` and now he is our son"
People called person_2 imbecile ; but that was not the right expression.
`` Poor imbecile person_2 !"
said the people.
He it was whose life was to have been so pleasant that it would be `` presumption and pride"
to expect or believe in a higher existence hereafter.
.
`` The Lord is good to all ; and His mercy is over all His works"
In the churchyard where the sand blows across the walls , Clara lay buried.
He uttered her name , and became pale as death , and tears rolled over his cheeks.
`` Poor child !"
Merchant Broenne and his wife now rested here with their children , under the white sand.
It was spring-time , the season of storms.
from towards the Hunsby dunes.
One evening person_2 was sitting alone in the room.
`` Home ! home !"
he exclaimed.
No one heard him.
He went out of the house towards the dunes.
Sand and stones blew into his face and whirled around him.
The storm went howling over the town of person_3.
as the old song said.
Full of blessedness and joy.
Hallelujah !"
And these words were the last that person_2 spoke in this world.
The next morning was Sunday , and the congregation and their pastor went forth to the service.
So they sang a psalm under the open sky , and went back to their homes.
His body lay buried in a great sepulchre , in the church itself.
THE BISHOP OF BOeRGLUM AND HIS WARRIORS.
Our scene is in Northern Jutland , in the so called `` wild moor"
We hear what is called the `` Wester-wow-wow"
-- the peculiar roar of the North Sea as it breaks against the western coast of Jutland.
On this mountain of sand is a lofty old building -- the convent of person_0.
In one of its wings -LRB- the larger one -RRB- there is still a church.
The wind moans very strangely here , both within and without.
The sea washes away the blood that has flowed from cloven skulls.
The stranded goods belong to the bishop , and there is a store of goods here.
The Bishop of person_0 is a mighty lord.
His rich cousin at Thyland is dead , and his widow is to have the rich inheritance.
Her son was not at home.
For years there had been no news of him.
`` What has a woman to do with rule ?"
said the bishop.
Twice had icy winter returned before the bishop welcomed the horsemen and servants back to their home.
`` Cursed be she , and all that belongs to her.
Let her be expelled from the congregation and the Church.
`` What will not bend must break ,"
said the Bishop of person_0.
And all forsake the widow ; but she holds fast to her God.
He is her helper and defender.
`` Thou child of hell , I will yet carry out my purpose !"
cries the Bishop of person_0.
-LRB- person_1 : JENS GLOB MEETS HIS MOTHER.
Strange merchants drive by her , and they look anxiously after their waggons laden with merchandise.
They fear an attack from the armed followers of the robber-knights.
And now they were in Franconia.
And there met them a stalwart knight , with a train of twelve armed followers.
For the stranger knight is the widow 's son.
He seized her hand , he embraced her , and the mother wept.
The sea rolled wine-tubs to the shore for the bishop 's cellar.
In the kitchen the deer roasted on the spit before the fire.
`` That will avail him little ,"
said the bishop.
`` Best leave off thy efforts , knight Jens"
are swarming , and sting the traveller 's face till they melt.
`` Keen weather to-day ,"
say the people , as they step in.
Jens Glob stands so deeply wrapped in thought that he singes the skirt of his wide garment.
`` Thou person_0 bishop ,"
Moorland and meadow are covered with ice and snow.
The marsh will bear horse and rider , the bishop with his priests , and armed men.
They ride the shortest way , through the waving reeds , where the wind moans sadly.
The wind is blowing his trumpet too -- blowing it harder and harder.
He blows up a storm -- a terrible storm -- that increases more and more.
Towards the church they ride , as fast as they may through the storm.
The church is the judgment hall ; the altar is the council table.
The lights burn clear in the heavy brass candelabra.
No ferry-boat can sail over the bay in such weather as this.
Olaf Hase makes halt at Ottesworde.
The faithful warriors will not leave him , but follow him out into the deep waters.
They have still four miles to ride.
It is past midnight.
It is Christmas.
The wind has abated.
And now Olaf Hase arrives.
`` Sayest thou so ?"
replied Olaf Hase.
`` Then neither thou nor the bishop shall quit this church alive"
`` Hold , brother ! First hear what the agreement was that I made.
I have slain the bishop and his warriors and priests.
And four days afterwards the bells toll for a funeral in the convent of person_0.
The incense rises in clouds , and the monks chant the funeral hymn.
It is heard by the sleepless listener in the thickly-walled rooms at person_0.
A storm approaches without , calling aloud for human lives.
The sea has not put on a new mind with the new time.
Sleep sweetly , if thou canst sleep ! Now it is morning.
The new time flings sunshine into the room.
The wind still keeps up mightily.
A wreck is announced -- as in the old time.
In comfortable rooms they encounter hospitality and friendly faces.
The old man came , took a drink , and went away.
And he did so.
